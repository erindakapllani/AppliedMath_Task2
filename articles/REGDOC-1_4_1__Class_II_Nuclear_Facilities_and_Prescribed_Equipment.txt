1. 
Introduction 
The licence requirements contained in this guide are based on the Nuclear Safety and Control Act 
(NSCA) and its regulations, which are administered by the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission 
(CNSC), the organization that has regulatory authority for all nuclear facilities and uses of 
radioactive materials in Canada. Appendix A provides regulatory references for the information 
requested. 
The NSCA authorizes the CNSC to issue licences to applicants who, in the opinion of the CNSC: 
 
are qualified to undertake the proposed licensed activity 
 
will make adequate provisions for the health and safety of persons, the protection of the 
environment and the maintenance of national security 
 
will take measures necessary to implement international obligations to which Canada has 
agreed 
Each application should demonstrate that the applicant is capable of and committed to complying 
with all requirements under the NSCA, including maintaining an effective radiation safety 
program as required by the Radiation Protection Regulations.  
This guide will help the applicant to provide the information the CNSC needs in order to make a 
determination of whether to issue a licence. The associated application form is tailored to 
different licensed activities or facility types, and is intended to aid the applicant in preparing and 
submitting a complete application. 
This guide and its associated form may also be used to request the removal of commissioning 
restrictions in an operating licence (“routine operation amendment”). 
1.1

 
service Class II prescribed equipment 
 
possess, use, store, transfer, import or export a nuclear substance used in manual 
brachytherapy, incorporated in Class II prescribed equipment, or otherwise associated with 
the licensed activity 
1.2 
Scope

Part B: Activities and Facilities to be Licensed 
B.1 
Licence Type and Phase 
Once the user selects the appropriate licence type and phase, the form will only display the 
sections that are relevant to the licence being requested. 
Applicants who wish to licence fixed facilities typically go through the licensing phases in the 
following order: construction, commissioning, operation and, if applicable, decommissioning.  
Applicants wishing to operate Class II prescribed equipment outside of a fixed facility (portable 
accelerators, geophysical logging accelerators, etc.) are not required to complete the construction 
or commissioning phases and may apply directly for an operation licence. 
Applicants wishing to service Class II prescribed equipment and who do not also hold a CNSC 
operating licence or do not intend to operate prescribed equipment may apply directly for a 
licence to service. 
For commissioning/operation licence applications, applicants have the option to concurrently 
apply to include servicing of the prescribed equipment by the operator’s staff. This option is 
selected later in the form. 
March 2021 
REGDOC-1.4.1, Licence Application Guide: 
 
Class II Nuclear Facilities and Prescribed Equipment

Modifications to a currently licensed facility may require a construction licence and 
commissioning activities if the modifications will result in changes to the doses or dose rates 
surrounding the facility (shielding change, beamline change, etc.). Contact your CNSC licensing 
officer for more information. 
In addition to selecting the licence type/phase, specify whether nuclear substances or activated 
components will be included or affected by the application (this includes nuclear substances 
incorporated in Class II prescribed equipment). 
Indicate if this application is for renewal of a current CNSC licence; if so, enter the current CNSC 
licence number. 
B.1.1 
Construction 
Indicate the sector under which the desired facility to be constructed falls and then select one of 
the resultant facility types. At this time, because the CNSC does not issue consolidated 
construction licences, it is only possible to make one selection. Applicants who wish to construct 
multiple facility types concurrently will need to submit a separate application for each. 
Although details of the management system and radiation protection program are not required for 
a construction licence, the CNSC recommends that if this information exists, it be submitted at 
the construction phase. This information must be submitted before a CNSC operating licence can 
be issued. If submitting this information with the construction application, select the appropriate 
checkbox. 
B.1.2 
Commissioning (with option to service) 
Indicate the sector under which the facility to be commissioned falls and then select one of the 
resultant facility types. In instances where limited research is to be carried out utilizing Class II 
prescribed equipment that is primarily being used for other applications, the prescribed equipment 
should be licensed according to its primary intended use.  
While it is possible to consolidate commissioning and servicing activities, applicants who wish to 
commission multiple facility types will need to submit a separate application for each. 
Applicants who wish to perform servicing operations on the prescribed equipment while it is 
being commissioned must either enter the current CNSC licence number that allows servicing of 
the prescribed equipment or select the checkbox requesting that a consolidated commissioning 
and servicing licence be issued. Applicants must demonstrate that they meet the requirements for 
a licence to service by filling in the relevant sections of the form, which will be displayed when 
the checkbox is selected.  
B.1.2.1 
Replacing Class II equipment in an existing facility 
Licensees wishing to replace Class II prescribed equipment in fixed facilities without otherwise 
modifying the facility design may bypass the construction licensing phase and apply directly for a 
commissioning licence, provided that the following conditions are met: 
 
For isocentric facilities, the isocentre has not moved; it may also be acceptable if the 
isocentre has moved towards an area adjacent to the room/bunker that is below grade or has

zero occupancy. For such cases, contact your CNSC licensing officer to confirm that it is 
acceptable to skip the construction phase.  
 
The maximum field size of the radiation beam is the same or smaller. 
 
The energy or accelerating potential is the same or lower than that of the equipment that is 
being replaced. 
Note: A subset of the information that is normally required at the construction phase will still 
need to be submitted (workload, dose rate calculations, etc.) concurrently with the commissioning 
licence application. Selecting the “Replacing Class II equipment in an existing facility” checkbox 
will ensure that the relevant sections of the form are displayed. 
B.1.3 
Operation (with option to service) 
Indicate the sector under which the desired facility or Class II prescribed equipment to be 
operated falls, then select one of the resultant facility types. In instances where limited research is 
to be carried on utilizing prescribed equipment that is primarily being used for other applications, 
the prescribed equipment should be licensed according to its primary intended use.  
While it is possible to perform operation and servicing activities under a single consolidated 
licence, applicants (other than those in the medical sector) who wish to operate multiple facility 
types must submit a separate application for each facility type. Medical sector applicants may 
apply to operate multiple facilities or perform manual brachytherapy in a single application. 
Applicants who wish to perform servicing operations on the prescribed equipment as well as 
operate it must either enter the current CNSC licence number that allows servicing of the 
prescribed equipment or select the checkbox requesting that a consolidated operation and 
servicing licence be issued. Applicants must demonstrate that they meet the requirements for a 
licence to service by filling in the relevant sections of the form, which will be displayed when the 
checkbox is selected.  
B.1.4 
Decommissioning 
Indicate the sector under which the desired facility to be decommissioned falls, and then select 
one of the resultant facility types. At this time, because the CNSC does not issue consolidated 
decommissioning licences, it is only possible to make one selection on the form. Applicants who 
wish to decommission multiple facility types will need to submit a separate application for each. 
Licensees wishing to decommission a brachytherapy remote afterloader do not require a 
decommissioning licence. However, information regarding the disposal method of any nuclear 
substance encompassed by the licence, as well as evidence that the facility is safe for uncontrolled 
occupancy, must be submitted concurrently with the request to revoke the operating licence. See 
section 3.6 for more information. 
Decommissioning implies servicing of Class II prescribed equipment, an activity that requires a 
CSNC licence. Applicants must either enter the current CNSC licence number that allows 
servicing of the prescribed equipment or select the checkbox indicating that additional 
information will be submitted. Applicants must demonstrate that they meet the requirements for a 
licence to service by filling in the relevant sections if the form, which will be displayed when the 
checkbox is selected.

proposed facility. CNSC staff require drawings showing the vertical and two orthogonal lateral 
cross sections of the facility. The drawings must be to scale in order to allow CNSC staff to 
perform independent verifications of applicants’ shielding calculations. If possible, submit these 
drawings in electronic format, provided there is sufficient resolution to magnify areas of interest 
and the scale is maintained. 
C.1.2 
Classification of adjacent areas 
Submit occupancy types and occupancy factors of all areas adjacent to the facility. 
The purpose of each area adjacent to a Class II nuclear facility, its occupancy type and its 
occupancy factor are used to determine the facility shielding requirements. 
Specify the intended use (such as office space, corridors and consoles) of all areas adjacent to the 
facility, including areas above and below the facility. Based on the planned use of each area and 
an evaluation of the shielding, classify each area as follows: 
 
Non-controlled: Access is not restricted.  
 
Controlled: Access is restricted to trained and authorized personnel only. 
 
For each controlled area, describe the proposed access control measures, which should be 
commensurate with the radiation doses that may be incurred in that area (allowed dose 
levels will be based on whether or not the applicant declares their workers to be NEWs– 
see section E.2.2). 
 
Exclusion: An exclusion area must have access controls interlocked to the Class II prescribed 
equipment so that no one can gain access to the area when the equipment is in operation; the 
interlock systems required are described in section C.2.1. 
 
Designation of an “exclusion area” is only acceptable for completely enclosed 
spaces with entrances interlocked with the equipment to terminate irradiation if 
anyone attempts to access the area. 
The occupancy factor for each area is the fraction of the facility’s normal operating day during 
which a person might reasonably be expected to occupy a given area. Occupancy factors are 
usually selected from standard reference values such as those in table B1 in the National Council 
on Radiation Protection’s NCRP Report No.151, Structural Shielding Design and Evaluation for 
Megavoltage X- and Gamma-Ray Radiotherapy Facilities [7]. Such values are generally 
conservative. If the applicant elects to use a lower value for a particular area such as for the roof 
above a treatment room, the applicant must provide the rationale for using that occupancy factor.

In general, use of very low occupancy factors requires some form of physical barrier that restricts 
access to the area. 
Occupancy types and occupancy factors of areas adjacent to the facility may be incorporated 
directly into a table of annual doses, provided they are clearly identified in the table. Ensure that 
those areas can be identified on the submitted plans and drawings.  
C.1.3 
Workload  
Submit an estimate or a calculation of the anticipated maximum annual workload of all Class II 
prescribed equipment at the facility. 
The workload represents the anticipated amount of use of the Class II prescribed equipment over 
a defined period, usually one year, in a manner that can be related directly to the radiation doses 
incurred by persons occupying adjacent areas over that period. In general, this requires an 
estimate of the total time the prescribed equipment will be on, or the source exposed, combined 
with some measurement or estimate of the radiation dose rates at defined reference locations 
under typical operating conditions. 
The workload is used to verify the adequacy of the facility’s shielding design; hence, a workload 
calculation must take into account all operating activities, namely: 
 
the equipment’s intended use (radiography, radiotherapy, etc.) 
 
research/development 
 
quality assurance 
 
post-servicing verification 
The applicant should describe any assumptions made and specify the value of any parameter 
used.  
The maximum anticipated workload submitted by the applicant will become the upper limit 
allowed once a licence is issued. Exceedance of this annual workload must only occur with the 
prior approval of the CNSC. 
C.1.3.1 
Particle accelerators 
Medical or veterinary accelerators  
The workload of medical or veterinary accelerators and teletherapy machines should clearly 
distinguish between: 
 
operation at different photon energies 
 
operation using electrons 
 
operation in different modes (“flattening-filter-free”, etc.) 
The number of monitor units (MUs) required to deliver the dose for each of the above scenarios 
must also be provided.

Class II Nuclear Facilities and Prescribed Equipment 
 
 
19 
 
If intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), stereotactic, or extended distance treatments are 
planned, also specify: 
 
the energy used  
 
the fraction of the total primary beam workload delivered using these techniques 
 
the expected average IMRT factor (ratio of MUs delivered to primary beam dose at isocentre) 
Industrial accelerators 
For electron accelerators such as those used for industrial radiography, material processing or 
sterilization, the dose rate (in Gy/min or equivalent) at a fixed location within the beam (e.g., at 
1 m beyond the X-ray target), multiplied by the total hours per year of each operating activity 
listed in section C.1.3, will generally allow the applicant to characterize the workload in a manner 
that enables dose estimates. 
Research accelerators 
In research facilities, the radiation types, energies and dose rates produced by an accelerator will 
vary greatly depending on the design and configuration of the accelerator, the types of charged 
particles being accelerated, the accelerating potential and beam current, the target design, and the 
materials of the target and of its housing. In such cases, the applicant should perform a detailed 
analysis of the intended use of the accelerator and of activities listed in section C.1.3 to 
characterize the workload in a manner that enables dose estimates. Depending on the type of 
accelerator, the methods described above may be most appropriate.  
C.1.3.2 
Class II prescribed equipment containing sealed sources 
An estimate of the workload can be obtained based on the total time the sources would typically 
be exposed, and the sources’ activity. For the purpose of shielding design, this estimate must be 
converted into an equivalent dosimetric quantity, denoted in gray (Gy) at 1 m from the source 
over one year.  
In addition to the type of operations listed in section C.1.3, the workload for irradiators and 
brachytherapy remote afterloaders must also take into account the periodic calibration of the 
equipment. 
C.1.3.3 
Isotope production accelerators 
For each isotope to be produced, list the maximum total quantity that will be possessed under the 
licence at any one time and the maximum total quantity for each isotope produced in one calendar 
year. The determination of the maximum quantity that may be produced should be based on: 
 
the maximum end-of-beam (EOB) quantity that can be produced using any target 
 
the number of targets used and the number of production runs per day  
 
the time between production and shipment of the product to the end user  
 
the amounts that will be kept in the facility for quality control or as waste  
 
the isotope’s half-life 
In the workload table, specify the nuclear reaction that yields the desired product and the 
beam/target combinations used. Specify the maximum EOB quantity produced per run, as well as 
annual quantities produced and total annual bombardment time. Include in the workload the time 
used in carrying on the applicable activities listed in section C.1.3.

Instantaneous dose rates and annual dose calculations 
Submit detailed calculations showing the maximum instantaneous dose rate and annual dose 
expected in each area listed in section C.1.2. Provide the equations, describe the assumptions and 
specify the value of each parameter used in the calculations. If applicable, include both neutron 
and gamma doses.  
For occupied areas, CNSC regulatory guide G-129, rev. 1Keeping Radiation Exposures and 
Doses “As Low As Reasonably Achievable (ALARA)” [2], recommends that doses be at or below: 
 
1 mSv/yr for NEWs 
 
0.05 mSv/yr for non-NEW staff and members of the public  
If any annual dose is calculated to be higher than that recommended in G-129, submit 
justification explaining why it is not socially/economically feasible to reduce the dose.  
The CNSC will not accept dose calculations that are greater than the dose limits set out in section 
13 of the Radiation Protection Regulations. 
In the submission: 
1. each calculation point should be associated with a location identified on the facility plans and 
drawings 
2. at least one calculation point must be located just outside the entrance barrier to the facility, 
such as a door or light curtain  
3. each calculation should take into account:

b. the composition and shielding properties or transmission factors of barriers (including 
shielded doors, where applicable) for the types and energies of the radiation produced by 
the Class II prescribed equipment 
c. the distribution of the workload between the different beam orientations, the use factor  
where applicable 
d. the distribution of the workload between the different operating modes (energies, beam 
particle types, with/without filters/targets, etc.) where applicable 
e. the maximum instantaneous dose rate that the equipment is capable of for each operating 
mode 
f. the occupancy type (controlled/uncontrolled/exclusion) and occupancy factor for each of 
those areas 
g. the radiation dose limit (for NEWs or the public) in effect at each calculation point 
h. the contribution from different components of the radiation fields produced by the 
equipment, including the primary beam, head leakage, scatter and neutrons (Note: 
Neutron dose rate and annual dose calculations are not required for electron accelerator 
facilities operating at photon energies less than 10 MV or any high-energy (≥10 MV) 
electron accelerator facilities that are being retrofitted for low energy (<10 MV) use) 
i. 
the contribution from all sources of radiation, such as the maximum dose rate at a point in 
a common hallway between two facilities 
j. 
radiation scatter down entrance mazes, ducts and other penetrations in the shielding 
4. calculation parameters should be based on standard reference values for factors such as 
shielding tenth-value layers, equipment head leakage rates, scatter factors and occupancy 
factors. If these are unavailable, for example, because of variations in the composition and

21 
 
density of heavy concrete, or non-standard parameters such as occupancy factors less than 
1/40th are used, the applicant should justify the values used 
5. instantaneous dose rate at each calculation point should be calculated using the most 
conservative (i.e., worst-case) operating conditions such as maximum energy, maximum 
instantaneous dose rate or current, minimum attenuation by shielding, and maximum source 
activity; these calculations must: 
a. provide reference values for comparison with the measured dose rates that will be 
obtained during a radiation survey 
b. identify areas where posting of a radiation warning sign may be required pursuant to the 
requirements of section 21(b) of the Radiation Protection Regulations 
6. if Monte Carlo simulations or other commercial shielding calculation software are used, the 
applicant should:

Safety Systems – Nuclear Facilities   
Submit a description of the facility safety systems.  
March 2021 
REGDOC-1.4.1, Licence Application Guide: 
 
Class II Nuclear Facilities and Prescribed Equipment 
 
 
25 
 
The systems listed in this section of the document are either explicitly required by the Class II 
regulations  or are industry standards. Use of any substitute system must be justified by 
demonstrating that it provides an equivalent level of safety. 
In addition to the requirements for each individual safety system as described in the following 
sections, the applicant must also submit: 
 
a drawing showing the location of each safety system component listed in all subsections 
below with respect to the physical layout of the Class II prescribed equipment and, if 
applicable, of the isotope processing facilities 
 
a flow chart describing the operation of the following: 
 
last person out (LPO) button(s) 
 
the door or entrance interlocks  
 
the emergency stops that are external to the Class II prescribed equipment 
 
any other switch, sensor or additional door interlock to be incorporated into the entrance 
interlock and LPO circuit 
The flow chart should describe the conditions/inputs necessary for proper activation of the LPO 
button, door or entrance interlocks and emergency stops external to the Class II prescribed 
equipment, and the results/outputs when each system is tripped.  
 
Subsection 15(14) of the Class II regulations provides that the provisions regarding 
entrance interlocks (subsection (2)), pre-irradiation alarms (subsection (3)); and 
emergency stop buttons (paragraphs (9)(a) and (c)), do not apply to a particle 
accelerator if it meets at least one of the following criteria: 
 
Its radiation dose rate at 30 cm is not greater than 200 µSv/hour with the 
equipment operating in a manner that produces the maximum dose rate as 
limited either by its characteristics or interlocks, and it is in a room with a lock 
and that can be unlocked and entered only by persons authorized by the 
licensee. 
 
Its radiation dose rate at 30 cm is not greater than 25 µSv/hour with the 
equipment operating in a manner that produces the maximum dose rate as 
limited either by its characteristics or interlocks. 
C.2.1 
Entrance interlocks 
Submit a description of the entrance interlocks and LPO system. The system must adequately 
protect against unintended exposure to personnel and members of the public. Consequently, the 
following requirements must be met: 
1. There must be an interlock at every entrance to a room where Class II prescribed equipment 
will be operated (and any other exclusion area) that terminates irradiation if the door is 
opened while the prescribed equipment is in operation. This interlock must require the last 
person leaving the area to:  
a. activate the circuit via an actuator (commonly referred to as the LPO switch) inside the 
area  
b. and then, within a specified time, close the door to transition to the ready-state or 
“armed” condition  
2. The LPO switch should be in a location that allows that person, while activating the switch, to 
verify that no one else remains inside the area prior to starting the irradiation. 
March 2021 
REGDOC-1.4.1, Licence Application Guide: 
 
Class II Nuclear Facilities and Prescribed Equipment 
 
 
26 
 
a. If there is no location within the area that allows for a clear view of the entire area, the 
applicant must implement additional measures to ensure that the entire area is clear 
before irradiation commences.  
b. Such measures may include adding other LPO switches at different locations, adding 
convex mirrors where needed, or taking other measures that provide an equivalent level 
of safety.  
3. The entrance interlock must be designed such that reopening of the door terminates or 
prevents irradiation until the sequence described above is repeated; furthermore, it should be 
designed such that any defect or component failure in the system will prevent operation of the 
Class II prescribed equipment and cause it to “fail safely”, that is, to revert to a safe state.  
4. Doorless entrances must retain the same operational capability as described above.  
a. However, with doorless entrances, the physical door interlock switch at the entrance to 
the exclusion area may be replaced by other devices, such as electric eyes, active infrared 
sensors or motion detectors located at the entrance or within the entrance maze.  
b. Such systems will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, and the applicant must 
demonstrate that they provide the operational capability and level of safety equivalent to 
that of a physical door. 
C.2.2 
Irradiation state indicators  
Submit a description of the irradiation state indicators, such as warning lights, identified in the 
facility plans. The applicant must demonstrate that the irradiation state warning display clearly 
indicates the status of the Class II prescribed equipment and whether or not it is safe to enter the 
room where it is located. 
Irradiation state indicators must be: 
 
installed at each entrance to any room where Class II prescribed equipment will be operated 
 
clearly visible from the entrance of the facility in all ambient light conditions 
 
located inside any potentially occupied enclosed area within the facility, such as equipment 
rooms, and above or beside the entrance leading into the facility  
 
if there are multiple entrances, a single warning display at a central location may suffice, 
provided that it is clearly visible from all points within that area 
Irradiation state indicators should: 
 
flash or illuminate in a clearly visible manner when the Class II prescribed equipment is ON 
or when radioactive sources are exposed 
 
be consistent in design, colour, wording, location and operation, for all facilities at a given 
site 
 
any wording or symbol used to indicate the state of irradiation, such as “beam ON”, 
“beam OFF”, “source exposed”, and “source shielded” should be the same for all 
facilities of that type at a given site 
 
where the colour of a light also serves as an indicator of the state of irradiation (such as 
green for “beam OFF” or “source shielded” and red for “beam ON” or “source 
exposed”), these colours should be the same for all facilities at a given site 
The applicant may install additional indicators, such as source position, radio frequency (RF) ON, 
KV imaging ON, magnet ON, and so on, provided they do not jeopardize the effectiveness of the 
radiation warning system.

C.2.3 
 Pre-irradiation alarms 
Submit a description of the audible pre-irradiation alarm. The purpose of the pre-irradiation alarm 
is to warn persons working in the exclusion area that irradiation will commence soon and that 
they must either exit that area or, if this is not possible, activate an emergency stop device to 
prevent irradiation. Consequently, the duration of the alarm must be sufficient for a person inside 
the area to activate an emergency stop device (section C.2.4). This alarm must sound before an 
irradiation is initiated, regardless of whether the exclusion area has been accessed since the 
previous irradiation. 
An applicant must install a pre-irradiation alarm in every facility that is not used on persons and 
does not satisfy the exemption requirements of subsection 15(14) of the Class II regulations. 
Applicants may propose other alarm systems if they can demonstrate that they provide an 
equivalent level of safety. Such proposals will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. 
C.2.4 
Emergency stop buttons or devices 
Submit a description of the design of all emergency stop buttons or equivalent devices. Every 
facility must be equipped with easily identifiable (coloured red, labelled, etc.) latching-type push 
buttons, or equivalent devices, that can be used in an emergency to immediately cause the Class II 
prescribed equipment to revert to a safe state.  
These devices must be designed so that once activated, the prescribed equipment cannot be 
restarted from the control console without the emergency stop device first being reset from the 
location where it was activated.  
For Class II prescribed equipment that does not satisfy the exemption described in section 15(14) 
of the Class II regulations, emergency stop devices must be located: 
 
at the control console 
 
on the inside of each entrance to the facility  
 
on both sides of the Class II prescribed equipment (except for brachytherapy remote 
afterloaders) 
 
for brachytherapy remote afterloaders, on the afterloader unit itself 
The emergency stop devices must be located where they are unobstructed and easily accessible. 
With isocentric equipment, they must not be in the equipment’s primary beam. For source-based 
equipment, moving towards the source of radiation should not be necessary in order to activate an 
emergency stop device.  
Since all walls of a facility housing a robotic arm radiotherapy accelerator are considered primary 
shielding barriers, there must be one emergency stop device on each wall. 
Depending upon the size and configuration of the facility, additional emergency stop devices may 
be required to ensure that they are readily accessible from all locations within the facility, 
including any enclosure located inside the facility such as an equipment room.

Radiation monitoring devices – General 
All facilities containing Class II prescribed equipment that incorporate a sealed source, as well as 
all isotope production accelerators, must be equipped with a monitoring device independent of the 
prescribed equipment to warn facility staff of the presence of abnormally high radiation levels in 
the event the prescribed equipment does not return to its safe state when the facility door is 
opened. 
Radiation monitoring devices must have a battery backup or be connected to the site emergency 
power supply to ensure that they continue to function in the event of a power failure. 
Submit a description of the facility radiation monitoring devices, including the make, model and 
sensitivity of detector, and the backup power system.  
A radiation monitor of this type is also recommended, but is not mandatory, for accelerator 
facilities.  
C.2.5.1 
Class II prescribed equipment incorporating sealed sources 
Submit a description of the facility radiation monitoring devices. The radiation monitoring 
devices must: 
 
be capable of detecting when the source is not in the fully shielded position   


 
operate independently from the Class II prescribed equipment 
 
be capable of continuously monitoring radiation dose rates  
 
have alarm thresholds appropriate to each area being monitored so they are not activated 
while the source is in the shielded position  
Should the source not retract to its fully shielded position, the dose rate at the radiation 
monitoring device location would vary greatly depending on its location relative to the source, the 
orientation of the Class II prescribed equipment and the exact location where the source has 
jammed. Consequently, the radiation monitoring device must be sensitive enough to detect 
radiation levels as low as the normal ambient level with the source in its fully shielded position, 
while still remaining operational under the expected maximum exposure conditions. The alarm 
threshold should be adjusted to the lowest level that does not result in an alarm when the source is 
in the fully shielded position. Specify the monitoring thresholds proposed and justify their choice 
in terms of maintaining radiation doses ALARA.
