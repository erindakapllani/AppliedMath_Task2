Preface 
This regulatory document is part of the CNSC’s Human Performance Management series of regulatory 
documents, which also covers personnel training and fitness for duty. The full list of regulatory document 
series is included at the end of this document and can also be found on the CNSC’s website. 
Regulatory document REGDOC-2.2.3, Personnel Certification, Volume I: Exposure Device Operators, 
Version 1.1 provides, through a reference, the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission’s requirements and 
guidance for certification as an exposure device operator (EDO) and for renewal of an EDO certification, 
pursuant to the Nuclear Substances and Radiation Devices Regulations. This information is detailed in a 
Canadian Standards Association (CSA Group) document; where regulatory information is already 
available, this document points to that information to promote clarity and avoid discrepancies between 
sources. 
Version 1.1 updates the reference to CSA PCP-09: Exposure Device Operator Personnel Certification 
Guide – Revision 1, which was published in August 2021.

Personnel Certification: Exposure Device Operators 
1. 
Introduction 
An exposure device is a device that contains a sealed nuclear substance that is used in industrial 
radiography to evaluate the internal structure and integrity of metals and other materials in 
pipelines, welds, castings and building structures. To protect the health, safety and security of 
workers, the public, and the environment, the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC) 
regulates the personnel who are allowed to operate exposure devices in Canada. 
1.1 
Purpose 
The purpose of this regulatory document is to provide, through a reference, the CNSC’s 
requirements and guidance for certification as an exposure device operator (EDO) and for 
renewal of an EDO certification. This information is detailed in a Canadian Standards 
Association (CSA Group) document.  
1.2 
Scope 
This document applies to any person seeking certification as an EDO or seeking to renew their 
EDO certification pursuant to the Nuclear Substances and Radiation Devices Regulations 
(NSRDR).  
1.3 
Relevant legislation 
The provisions of the Nuclear Safety and Control Act (NSCA) and its regulations relevant to this 
document include: 
1. Paragraph 21(1)(i) of the NSCA states that “The Commission may, in order to attain its 
objects, certify and decertify persons referred to in paragraph 44(1)(k) as qualified to carry 
out their duties under this Act or the duties of their employment, as the case may be;” 
2. Paragraph 37(2)(b) of the NSCA states that “The Commission may authorize a designated 
officer to certify and decertify persons referred to in paragraph 44(1)(k) as qualified to carry 
out their duties under this Act or the duties of their employment, as the case may be;” 
3. Paragraph 44(1)(k) of the NSCA states that “The Commission may, with the approval of the 
Governor in Council, make regulations respecting the qualifications for, and the training and 
examination of, analysts, inspectors, nuclear energy workers and other persons employed in a 
nuclear facility or other place where a nuclear substance or prescribed equipment is produced, 
used, possessed, packaged, transported, stored or disposed of, and prescribing the fees for the 
examination of analysts, inspectors, nuclear energy workers and such other persons;” 
4. Section 24 of the NSRDR states that “No person other than a certified exposure device 
operator, or a trainee who is acting under the direct supervision and continuous observation of 
a certified exposure device operator, shall operate an exposure device.”

5. Section 25 of the NSRDR states that “The Commission or a designated officer authorized 
under paragraph 37(2)(b) of the Act may certify a person as an exposure device operator after 
receiving an application that includes the following information: 
a) the person’s name and business address; 
b) the person’s training and experience; and 
c) evidence of the successful completion by the person of an examination recognized by the 
Commission.”

Exposure Device Operators 
Pursuant to the NSRDR, only a certified exposure device operator (EDO) or a trainee acting 
under the direct supervision and continuous observation of a certified EDO is allowed to operate 
an exposure device. Any person who wishes to be certified as an EDO or who wishes to renew 
their EDO certification must submit an application to the CNSC.   
The CNSC’s requirements and guidance for certification as an EDO and for renewal of an EDO 
certification are specified in the Canadian Standards Association (CSA Group) document CSA 
PCP-09, Exposure Device Operator Personnel Certification Guide – Revision 1. CSA PCP-09 
was produced by the CSA Group with assistance from a committee of experts from the 
radiography industry, the CNSC and other government departments. The document, along with 
additional information on EDOs and EDO certification, is available on the CNSC website.
