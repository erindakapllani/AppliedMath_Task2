Preface 
This regulatory document is part of the CNSC’s reactor facilities series of regulatory documents, which 
also includes licence application guides for licences to construct, operate and decommission nuclear 
power plants. The full list of regulatory document series is included at the end of this document and can 
also be found on the CNSC’s website. 
Regulatory document REGDOC-1.1.1, Site Evaluation and Site Preparation for New Reactor Facilities 
sets out requirements and guidance for site evaluation and site preparation for new reactor facilities. It 
also includes a licence application guide for a licence to prepare a site for new reactor facilities. This 
document refers to both nuclear power plants and small reactor facilities as “reactor facilities”. Its content 
also addresses how site evaluation information obtained during site preparation activities is used and 
revisited in subsequent lifecycle phases of construction and operation. 
This regulatory document replaces the previously published RD-346, Site Evaluation for Nuclear Power 
Plants. It revised RD-346 to: 
• 
expand scope to include small reactor facilities using a graded approach 
• 
include site preparation requirements and guidance 
• 
describe the necessary robust characterization of the site to include: 
• 
consideration of events to include multiple and simultaneous severe external events that could 
exceed the design basis 
• 
multiple and simultaneous reactor accidents 
• 
discussions around emergency planning and preparations for extreme events earlier in a project 
This document will be used to assess licence applications for new reactor facilities (including as support 
information for the construction and operational phases) and should be considered as a modern standard 
that should be included in a periodic safety review (PSR) for existing reactor facilities. Once the 
Commission has granted a licence to prepare site, the safety and control measures described in the licence 
application and the documents needed to support the application will form part of the licensing basis. 
Guidance contained in this document exists to inform the applicant, to elaborate further on requirements 
or to provide direction to licensees and applicants on how to meet requirements. It also provides more 
information about how CNSC staff evaluate specific problems or data during their review of licence 
applications. Licensees are expected to review and consider guidance; should they choose not to follow it, 
they should explain how their chosen alternate approach meets regulatory requirements.  
A graded approach, commensurate with risk, may be defined and used when applying the requirements 
and guidance contained in this regulatory document. The use of a graded approach is not a relaxation of 
requirements. With a graded approach, the application of requirements is commensurate with the risks 
and particular characteristics of the facility or activity. 
An applicant or licensee may put forward a case to demonstrate that the intent of a requirement is 
addressed by other means and demonstrated with supportable evidence. 
The requirements and guidance in this document are consistent with modern national and international 
practices addressing issues and elements that control and enhance nuclear safety. In particular, they 
establish a modern, risk-informed approach to site evaluation. 
By following the information in this regulatory document, applicants will submit the appropriate 
information to demonstrate that they are qualified and will make adequate and reasonable provisions to 
undertake the activity to be licensed.

Important note: Where referenced in a licence either directly or indirectly (such as through licensee-
referenced documents), this document is part of the licensing basis for a regulated facility or activity.  
The licensing basis sets the boundary conditions for acceptable performance at a regulated facility or 
activity, and establishes the basis for the CNSC’s compliance program for that regulated facility or 
activity.  
Where this document is part of the licensing basis, the word “shall” is used to express a requirement to 
be satisfied by the licensee or licence applicant. “Should” is used to express guidance or that which is 
advised. “May” is used to express an option or that which is advised or permissible within the limits of 
this regulatory document. “Can” is used to express possibility or capability. 
Nothing contained in this document is to be construed as relieving any licensee from any other 
pertinent requirements. It is the licensee’s responsibility to identify and comply with all applicable 
regulations and licence conditions.

Site Evaluation and Site Preparation for New Reactor Facilities 
1. 
Introduction 
1.1 
Purpose 
This regulatory document provides requirements and guidance for site evaluation and site 
preparation for new reactor facilities. It also includes a licence application guide for a licence to 
prepare a site for new reactor facilities.  
Site evaluation is integral to applications for licences to prepare a site to construct a nuclear 
facility, to operate and to decommission. The site characterization information obtained during 
site evaluation is taken into account in the design of the reactor facility and reevaluated during 
site preparation and over the lifecycle of the reactor facility (that is, construction, operation and 
decommissioning), including the periodic safety reviews and updates to the environmental risk 
assessment. 
1.2 
Scope 
This document refers to both nuclear power plants and small reactor facilities as “reactor 
facilities”. All criteria in this document can be applied to a smaller reactor facility using a risk-
informed approach. 
This document does not address site evaluation or site preparation for Class IA and IB nuclear 
facilities other than nuclear power plants and small reactor facilities. 
Further explanation on the application of site evaluation information in all lifecycle phases is 
provided in section 2, Background. 
1.3 
Relevant legislation

Federal environmental assessment legislation applies in the following instances: 
• 
designated projects  
• 
projects proposed to be carried out on federal lands 
1.4 
National and international standards 
Key principles and elements used in developing this document are consistent with national and 
international standards.  
Some sections of this document represent the CNSC’s adoption of the site evaluation principles 
set forth by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in NS-R-3 (Rev 1), Site Evaluation 
for Nuclear Installations [1] and the IAEA guides that support it. Where necessary, the tenets 
have been adapted to make them applicable to the CNSC’s regulatory requirements. The scope of 
this document goes beyond NS-R-3 in several aspects, such as protection of the environment, 
security of the site and protection of prescribed information, which are not addressed in NS-R-3.

This document serves the broader licensing needs under the NSCA and provides additional 
guidance for facilitating a more effective and efficient regulatory review. As with NS-R-3, this 
document considers all licensing phases, because information from the site evaluation process is 
required to support the CNSC licensing process at all phases of the facility lifecycle. 
2. 
Background 
Under the Nuclear Safety and Control Act (NSCA), the CNSC does not licence a reactor design. 
The following activities may be licensed: 
• 
site preparation for the purpose of constructing or operating a reactor facility 
• 
construction of a reactor facility 
• 
operation of a reactor facility 
• 
decommissioning of a reactor facility 
• 
abandonment of a reactor facility 
Licences can be combined to permit multiple activities. The applicant shall address all regulatory 
requirements pertaining to all activities proposed in the licence application. 
In most cases, policies, programs, processes, procedures and other safety and control measures 
developed at the lifecycle phase of site preparation will continue to be used, and will be adapted 
to support future phases of the project (that is, facility construction and operation). 
Where language is used, such as “current licensing phase” or “activities being conducted under 
the current licence”, the reader should interpret the text in the literal sense, but also from the point 
of view of an applicant seeking a decision from the Commission to conduct activities under that 
licensing phase. For example, if the current licensing phase is the licence to prepare site, 
requirements and guidance refers to either an applicant seeking a decision on an application for a 
licence to prepare site, or to a licensee conducting activities under a licence to prepare site. 
Early in the site evaluation process, the applicant shall conduct a review to consider whether the 
activity described in their licence application requesting authorization from the Commission: 
• 
could affect the environment 
• 
could adversely affect an Aboriginal group’s potential or established Aboriginal and/or treaty 
rights, such as the ability to hunt, trap, fish, gather or conduct cultural ceremonies 
If the review identifies effects, the applicant shall submit their review to the CNSC as part of their 
licence application or as a project description if decision on an environmental assessment (EA) 
under federal environmental assessment legislation is being sought prior to a licensing decision. 
Proposed projects may raise the Crown’s duty to consult. While the CNSC cannot delegate its 
obligation, it can delegate procedural aspects of the consultation process to applicants and 
licensees. The information collected and measures proposed by applicants and licensees to avoid, 
mitigate or offset adverse effects may be used by the CNSC in meeting its consultation 
obligations. 
2.1 
Environmental assessments 
For EAs conducted by the CNSC in accordance with federal environmental assessment 
legislation, the Commission must render an EA decision prior to making a licensing decision 
under the NSCA. 
July 2022 
REGDOC-1.1.1, Site Evaluation and Site Preparation for New Reactor Facilities 
 
5 
 
Site evaluation comprises a substantial part of an EA conducted in accordance with federal 
environmental assessment legislation. As such, information gathered during the site evaluation 
process should be used during the EA process. This information will be reviewed by the CNSC 
during the assessment of all licence applications in the facility’s lifecycle, in particular for 
preparing the application for a licence to prepare site. 
For more information on the CNSC’s EA and licensing processes, see: 
• 
REGDOC-2.9.1, Environmental Protection: Environmental Principles, Assessments and 
Protection Measures, Version 1.1 [2] 
• 
REGDOC-3.5.1, Licensing Process for Class I Nuclear Facilities and Uranium Mines and 
Mills, Version 2 [3] 
2.2 
Public and Aboriginal engagement 
Due to the nature of site evaluation and site preparation, public and Aboriginal engagement is a 
significant aspect of these stages. 
By addressing requirements early in the site evaluation and site preparation stages, public 
consultation and Aboriginal engagement are expected to lead to more effective and efficient 
consultation practices, strengthen relationships with Aboriginal communities, assist the CNSC in 
meeting its obligations regarding its duty to consult, and reduce the risk of delays in the 
regulatory review processes. 
2.2.1 
Public information and disclosure 
Early in the site evaluation process, the applicant shall develop and implement a public 
information and disclosure program and, as part of the application for a licence to prepare the site, 
submit the program to the CNSC. 
For more information, see RD/GD-99.3, Public Information and Disclosure [4]. 
2.2.2 
Aboriginal engagement 
When the applicant determines that the activity described in their licence application requesting 
authorization from the Commission could adversely affect potential or established Aboriginal 
and/or treaty rights, they shall: 
• 
identify and engage with potentially affected Aboriginal groups 
• 
submit an Aboriginal engagement report 
• 
submit material change updates to the Aboriginal engagement report 
• 
include a summary of Aboriginal engagement activities in their licence application and any 
submissions to the Commission 
For more information, see REGDOC-3.2.2, Aboriginal Engagement [5]. 
2.3 
Overview of site evaluation 
Site evaluation is done before the applicant submits an application to prepare a site for the 
eventual construction of a reactor facility. During the lifecycle of the nuclear facility, the site 
evaluation is reviewed and updated to reflect changes in the vicinity of the site, or to incorporate 
new scientific data and knowledge. 
July 2022 
REGDOC-1.1.1, Site Evaluation and Site Preparation for New Reactor Facilities

Information from the site evaluation should be continually considered throughout the lifecycle of 
the proposed facility (including construction and operation), to ensure that the facility’s design 
basis and safety case remain current with changing environmental conditions or modifications to 
the facility itself. A brief summary of the application of site evaluation information to the facility 
lifecycle phases is provided below: 
• 
site evaluation: section 3 of this document describes the information gathering and initial 
submission activities for the proposed site 
• 
site preparation: section 4 describes the information to be submitted as part of a licence 
application for a licence to prepare the site (no work may proceed before a licence to prepare 
the site is approved) 
• 
construction: the results of the site evaluation and, in particular, the site characterization are 
considered in the facility design and supporting safety analysis, which are in turn assessed as 
part of the review of a construction licence application 
• 
operation: the site evaluation information is considered in the design and licensing basis, and 
carried through to the subsequent lifecycle phases, including the licence to operate; 
information gathered during site evaluation, including the assumptions and bounding 
envelope would be reconfirmed at the continuing operation phase (the information about site 
evaluation in this document would also be considered as part of the suite of modern codes 
and standards during a periodic safety review) 
• 
decommissioning and abandonment: the site evaluation information is useful for the 
development of early strategies and plans to support the eventual dismantling of the facility 
and the management of waste, and to establish appropriate financial guarantees 
Appendices B through G contain working-level requirements and guidance for site evaluation. 
2.4 
Overview of site preparation 
Section 4 describes the requirements and guidance for the safety and control areas, and other 
matters of regulatory interest, that are applicable to site preparation.  
The licensing of reactor facilities in Canada involves several steps, beginning with consideration 
of the proposed site, conduct of the environmental assessment and issuance of a licence to prepare 
site. The Commission’s granting of the licence to prepare site declares the site suitable and 
permits the licensee to perform the licensed activity (site preparation). Note: No licence will be 
issued until the EA is complete and the Commission has determined that the proposed project is 
not likely to result in adverse environmental effects, taking into consideration the implementation 
of mitigation measures. For more information on the CNSC’s EA and licensing processes, see: 
• 
REGDOC-2.9.1, Environmental Protection: Environmental Principles, Assessments and 
Protection Measures, Version 1.1 [2] 
• 
REGDOC-3.5.1, Licensing Process for Class I Nuclear Facilities and Uranium Mines and 
Mills, Version 2 [3]. 
A substantial part of the submissions for the application for a licence to prepare site is used to 
demonstrate that the proposed site will also be suitable for the construction and operation of the 
proposed facility.

The site characterization and environmental assessment determine, for the entire lifecycle of the 
project, whether: 
• 
siting option choices were made to avoid or minimize environmental effects 
• 
the proposed facility and site infrastructure designs to be established are adequate (including 
the exclusion zone boundary, where appropriate) 
• 
the applicant will ensure adequate provision for the protection of the environment, the health 
and safety of persons and maintaining national security 
• 
effects are likely significant, taking into consideration mitigation measures 
Significant site evaluation work should be completed before initiating the application for a 
licence to prepare site. The CNSC recommends the applicant use the pre-application period to 
develop the safety case for site preparation, along with supporting information. 
The application for a licence to prepare site must be accompanied by the appropriate regulatory 
fee as outlined in the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission Cost Recovery Fees Regulations. 
The information in an application for a licence to prepare site and its referenced documents 
satisfies several primary purposes: 
• 
provides the safety case for the site preparation phase of the project, which in turn is 
incorporated into the licensing basis for the site preparation activities 
• 
documents the conditions of the site and surrounding region that must be addressed in any 
technologies being considered, and associated safety and control measures 
• 
demonstrates that any technologies under consideration for the site will be able to withstand 
the conditions imposed on the nuclear facility by the site and its surroundings 
• 
demonstrates that the site is suitable for a reactor facility’s full lifecycle 
This regulatory document does not presuppose or limit an applicant’s intention to implement a 
particular kind of technology in future licensing phases. 
For an applicant to obtain a licence to prepare site, the CNSC may request additional information 
from the applicant to further substantiate claims made in the application or to address any gaps 
found in the application.

Site Evaluation for New Reactor Facilities 
This section sets out the CNSC’s requirements and guidance for the evaluation of sites for new 
nuclear power plants and small reactor facilities (referred to as reactor facilities). 
Site evaluation is a process that continues throughout the lifecycle of the proposed facility, to 
ensure that the facility’s design basis and safety case remains current with changing 
environmental conditions or modifications to the facility itself. Site evaluation information is also 
a key input into reactor facility design and subsequent lifecycle phases. 
Site evaluation covers a substantial part of an environmental assessment (EA) conducted under 
federal environmental assessment legislation. Information gathered through the site evaluation 
process should be used during the EA process, and will be reviewed by the CNSC during the 
assessment of all licence applications in the facility’s lifecycle, in particular for the licence to 
prepare site. 
Site evaluation should begin before the submission of an application to prepare a site for the 
construction of a reactor facility. Site selection is not regulated under the NSCA, and is not 
addressed as a regulatory requirement in this document. However, the applicant should ensure 
that the site is evaluated at a level sufficient to confirm the suitability of the site for the activity.  
As stated in section 2, the licensing of reactor facilities in Canada involves several steps, 
beginning with consideration of the proposed site, conduct of the environmental assessment and 
issuance of a licence to prepare site. For more information on the CNSC’s EA and licensing 
processes, see: 
• 
REGDOC-2.9.1, Environmental Protection: Environmental Principles, Assessments and 
Protection Measures, Version 1.1 [2] 
• 
REGDOC-3.5.1, Licensing Process for Class I Nuclear Facilities and Uranium Mines and 
Mills, Version 2 [3] 
Note 1: Data and analysis results from site evaluation may be used to satisfy information needed 
for subsequent licensing phases, as specified in the NSCA and associated regulations. 
Note 2: The applicant should reject any unacceptable or inappropriate site before applying for a 
licence to prepare site, without requiring CNSC involvement. Submission of site evaluation 
information on rejected sites is not required. 
3.1 
Role of site evaluation in the CNSC regulatory process 
Figure 1 shows where site evaluation fits within the initial stages of reactor facility development, 
and shows the role of site evaluation in the CNSC regulatory process. Site evaluation is part of 
the information gathering and initial submission activities for the proposed site and includes 
public and Aboriginal consultations. This information provides input to future environmental 
assessments, environmental impact statements, and licence applications (such as licence to 
prepare a site, licence to construct, and licence to operate). For more information about the 
Crown’s duty to consult, see REGDOC-3.2.2, Aboriginal Engagement [5]. 
The results of the site evaluation, especially the site characterization, are used as inputs into the 
facility design, supporting safety analysis and licensing processes. For more information, see 
REGDOC-2.5.2, Design of Reactor Facilities: Nuclear Power Plants [6].

In accordance with CSA N288.6, Environmental risk assessments at class I nuclear facilities and 
uranium mines and mills [7], the site evaluation is periodically re-evaluated. The re-evaluation 
focuses on confirmation of the site characteristics (in particular, external events) and assessing the 
effects of the updated information. Design modifications, updates to operations, or both may be 
needed. 
Site evaluation information is also carried through to subsequent facility lifecycle phases. For 
example, facility design and safety analysis information are assessed as part of the reviews of 
applications for licences to construct and to operate a nuclear facility. 
3.2 
Site evaluation methodology 
The methodology of site evaluation typically involves conducting a site survey to identify one or 
more candidate sites, and then performing a detailed evaluation of those preferred sites to: 
• 
minimize the effects of the proposed reactor facility on the environment 
• 
minimize the effects of the environment on the ability of the reactor facility to operate within 
the defined safe operating envelope 
• 
identify mitigation strategies that may be needed (if the site is selected for the proposed 
reactor facility) to reduce risk to national security, health and safety, and the environment 
An additional goal of the site evaluation process is to anticipate satisfying the requirements of the 
NSCA and the regulations made under it by providing technical data that will be used in 
processes related to the design, construction, operation, and eventual decommissioning and 
abandonment of the reactor facility. 
Site characteristics and the effects of external events are integral considerations in the site 
evaluation process: 
• 
they may be used in assessing the risks to both the reactor facility and the environment, and 
in determining the mitigation strategies required to minimize those risks and their 
consequences 
• 
mitigation strategies feed into reactor facility site preparation and design through various 
safety assessment processes 
• 
site characteristics and associated risks feed into the public and Aboriginal consultation 
processes 
• 
emergency preparedness and security readiness ensure that adequate measures can be 
implemented at the appropriate licensing stages 
The degree of focus given to external events depends on their probability and severity. The 
amount of focus given to site characteristics depends on their ability to influence postulated 
events and contribute to an increased risk of adverse effects on the environment or on health and 
safety, or to adversely affect the execution of emergency response measures. 
3.3 
General criteria for site evaluation 
A detailed and methodical site evaluation, using a graded approach commensurate with the risks 
posed by the proposed reactor facility, is essential in preparing site mitigation strategies 
(including emergency response plans) that will adequately protect the facility personnel, the 
public and the environment from the effects of nuclear and hazardous substances arising from 
licensed activities.

Requirements for site evaluation 
Site evaluation shall take into account all phases of the facility lifecycle, from site preparation to 
abandonment. The applicant shall: 
• 
use a documented, systematic process for site evaluation (including site characterization) 
• 
consider the synergy of multiple simultaneous events (for example, combinations of external 
hazards, reactor facility events including beyond-design-basis events and severe accidents, 
and multiple effects of different activities on the site) 
For analysis of external hazards, the applicant shall consider both design-basis events and 
beyond-design-basis events. In particular, the applicant shall consider the concept of potential 
cliff-edge effects when analyzing external hazards, where a small change of conditions may lead 
to a catastrophic increase in the severity of consequences. 
For reactor facilities, the applicant shall analyze external hazards at the site evaluation stage, to 
confirm that the reactor facility will withstand such events. 
Evaluation of the suitability of a site for the construction and operation of a nuclear facility shall 
address the following considerations: 
• 
population density, population distribution and other characteristics of the emergency 
planning zone that may have an effect on the implementation of emergency response 
measures and the need to evaluate the risks to individuals and the general population 
• 
the technical basis for the safety and security analysis issues that will be included in the 
licence application (particularly important for the licence to prepare site), including the range 
of technologies being considered and the estimated total power for the reactor facility 
• 
categorization and assessment of the characteristics of the natural and human environment in 
the region that may be affected by potential radiological or conventional effects associated 
with site preparation and construction, operational states, and accident conditions 
• 
predictions about the evolution of the natural and human environment in the region, 
particularly population growth and distribution, which may have a bearing on safety and 
security throughout the projected lifecycle of the reactor facility 
• 
storage and transport of input and output materials – such as fresh and spent fuel, and 
radioactive waste 
• 
information about non-radiological effects due to chemical or thermal releases, or other site 
activities such as damage to aquatic organisms from entrainment into cooling water intakes, 
or physical disruption of landscape and shoreline from site development, and the potential for 
explosion and the dispersion of chemical products 
• 
as far as practicable, information about the potential for interactions between nuclear and 
conventional effluents, such as the combination of heat or chemicals with radioactive material 
in liquid effluents 
• 
predictions about the reactor facility’s effects on the population, including those that could 
lead to emergency conditions, with due consideration of relevant factors (for example, 
population distribution, use of land and water, radiological effect of any other releases of 
radioactive material in the region) 
• 
hazards associated with natural and human-induced external events, including future 
alterations of magnitude and frequency due to effects of climate change 
• 
evaluation against safety goals

In evaluating the site, the applicant shall also take into account the combined radiological and 
conventional effects of the site and the reactor facility on each other during normal and abnormal 
situations, based on both temporal (lifecycle) and spatial (regional, local and site) considerations. 
The applicant shall periodically review site-specific hazards using updated knowledge. 
Potentially significant changes in hazards (for example, in light of feedback of operating 
experience, a major accident or extreme events) should be evaluated in a timely manner.  
For more information, see appendixes B, F and G. 
Guidance 
The applicant should provide a high-level overview of alternate sites considered prior to selecting 
the proposed site, including a brief description of the degree and depth of site evaluation used to 
narrow down the final choice(s). 
If the site evaluation indicates deficiencies for which design features, site protection measures, or 
administrative procedures cannot compensate, the site should be deemed unacceptable or 
inappropriate. (As stated in note 2 above, the applicant should reject any unacceptable or 
inappropriate site before applying for a licence to prepare a site. Submission of site evaluation 
information on rejected sites is not required.) 
The applicant should describe how the characteristics of the natural and human induced hazards, 
as well as the demographic, meteorological and hydrological conditions of relevance to the 
nuclear installation, will be monitored over the nuclear facility’s lifecycle. 
3.3.1 
Evaluation against safety goals from a site perspective 
The applicant shall evaluate reactor facility designs against applicable safety goals, taking into 
account the characteristics of the site, the risks associated with external hazards (including any 
potential cliff-edge effects that may arise from small increases in the severity of external 
hazards), and the potential negative effect of the reactor facility on the environment. The 
evaluation shall include the effects of multiple unit events and – where applicable – effects from 
events that may affect multiple units. 
To support this evaluation, the applicant shall provide a summary of the process by which the 
different nuclear power plant or small reactor technologies being considered have been included 
in the site evaluation. Bounding approaches for site evaluation may be considered; however, 
bounding limits for a proposed facility must be based on credible information from designs being 
considered for that site. 
For more information on safety goals related to quantitative and qualitative safety goals, see 
appendices B through G, and REGDOC-2.5.2, Design of Reactor Facilities: Nuclear Power 
Plants [6]. 
3.3.2 
Consideration of the evolution of natural and human-induced factors 
The applicant shall evaluate the evolution of natural and human-induced factors in the 
environment that may have a bearing on safety and security across a time period that 
encompasses the projected lifecycle of the reactor facility, with the understanding that different 
levels of evaluation and monitoring apply to the various phases of the reactor facility’s lifecycle.

For more information, see appendices B and F. 
3.3.3 
Evaluation of hazards associated with external events 
The applicant shall examine the site with regard to the frequency and severity of external natural 
and human-induced events that could affect the safety and security of the reactor facility. The 
analysis shall include an examination of potential cliff-edge effects that may arise from small 
increases in the severity of events. This information provides a baseline for future assessments 
over the life of the facility. 
The applicant shall apply a systematic approach for identifying and assessing the hazards 
associated with external events. The approach (including the underlying rationale) shall be 
developed, documented, and implemented in an auditable fashion. 
The applicant shall identify and assess each external natural and human-induced event with the 
following considerations: 
• 
the potential direct and indirect effects of the event on the reactor facility structures, systems, 
and components (SSCs), including those that could affect the safe operation of the reactor 
facility in both normal and abnormal operating states: 
• 
direct effects (for example, an earthquake resulting in a main steam line break) 
• 
indirect effects (for example, a corrosive gas release from a nearby chemical plant 
degrading reactor facility safety system trip circuits via ventilation intakes) 
• 
the potential combined effects of external and human-induced events with normal and 
accidental releases from the reactor facility that would exceed environmental limits, or cause 
a significant adverse effect to occur 
• 
effects of natural external and human-induced events – including consequential events (that 
is, events that arise as a consequence of an initiating event) or reasonable combinations of 
independent events – that could influence the ability to successfully implement emergency 
response plans 
Derivation of the hazards associated with external events shall include consideration of the 
combined effects of these hazards with the ambient conditions (for example, simultaneous aircraft 
crash and heavy snowstorm). Combined effects of external hazards can have significant effects on 
such facets of the reactor facility as the implementation of emergency response plans, accident 
mitigation, and contaminant dispersion. 
The region assessed for each identified external event shall encompass the environment that could 
be affected. 
The evaluation shall consider foreseeable changes in land use for the projected lifecycle of the 
reactor facility, in order to assess and plan for mitigation of new external hazards introduced by 
changes in land use. 
For more information, refer to appendix F. 
Guidance 
Site-specific data should be used to determine hazards, unless such data is unobtainable. In this 
case, data from similar regions that is sufficiently relevant to the region of interest, or data 
July 2022 
REGDOC-1.1.1, Site Evaluation and Site Preparation for New Reactor Facilities 
 
14 
 
derived from appropriate and acceptable simulation techniques, may be used. Data from similar 
regions and from simulated findings may also be used to augment site-specific data. 
Prehistoric, historic, and instrumentally recorded information, and records of the identified 
external events and their severity, should be collected for the region and analyzed for reliability, 
accuracy, and completeness. 
3.3.4 
Determining the potential effect of the site on the environment 
During site evaluation, the applicant shall take into account considerations such as those listed in 
table A to minimize the potential effect of the site’s interaction with the environment (such as 
moving, destroying or substantially altering rare or sensitive habitats, biota, or areas of socio-
economic importance), including the structural, compositional, and functional components of its 
biodiversity. 
Table A describes considerations with respect to specific areas and activities that may be 
particularly sensitive to such interaction. 
Table A: Potential effects – considerations for special areas or activities 
Areas or activities  
Considerations 
Habitats essential to maintaining 
the viability of valued 
components (VCs), and 
designated protected habitats 
(national or provincial parks, 
reserves, etc.) 
1) Assess and minimize any potential interaction with 
critical habitats, or with individuals or species of 
conservation status. 
2) Assess and minimize any potential for destruction or 
substantial alteration of breeding, nesting, or spawning 
habitats. 
3) Assess and minimize any potential for destruction or 
substantial alteration of other critical habitats to VCs, such 
as over-wintering, feeding, or nursery habitats. 
Areas containing migratory routes 
of VCs. 
Assess and minimize any potential for compromising these 
natural heritage features that are used by VCs for 
migration, which may be site- or region-specific, and may 
include woodlands, wetlands, meadows, valley lands, 
estuaries, and the shorelines of streams and lakes. 
Areas of high biological 
production (for example, staging, 
feeding and rearing grounds for 
numerous VCs) and their 
connecting links or buffer zones. 
1) Assess and minimize any potential for compromising 
these natural heritage features, which may be site- or 
region-specific, and may include woodlands, wetlands, 
meadows, valley lands, estuaries, and the shorelines of 
streams and lakes. 
2) Consider that wetlands, salt marshes, mud flats, aquatic 
littoral zones, and offshore shoals may need buffer zones to 
protect areas of critical biodiversity functions from adverse 
effects such as contaminants and intrusions.

The applicant shall examine the site with respect to the risk from nuclear and hazardous 
substances to the public and the environment. These risks are to be kept as low as reasonably 
achievable. Risks include the effects of thermal pollution on surrounding bodies of water, and the 
effects of long-term onsite nuclear waste management. 
The applicant shall consider the synergy of multiple events. Some examples of such events are: 
• 
those that affect multiple units, including those leading to severe accidents 
• 
multiple effects of several different activities, such as simultaneous oil spill and fire 
• 
spills of multiple chemicals and interactions thereof 
Contaminant (nuclear and hazardous substances) pathway modelling shall incorporate 
atmospheric dispersion, surface water dispersion, and groundwater movement, as well as the 
associated abiotic and biotic environmental compartments. 
Models used for dispersion and pathways analyses shall include site-specific, local, and regional 
topographic features and characteristics of the reactor facility, and take into account natural and 
human-induced events that may influence contaminant behaviour. 
The pathways analyses shall take specific environmental and site characteristics into account, 
with special attention paid to the function of the biosphere in the accumulation and transport of 
nuclear and hazardous substances. 
To determine the potential contaminant effect on the environment, assessments of all releases 
shall be made under normal and accident conditions for all phases of the reactor facility’s 
lifecycle. This assessment shall include an examination of potential releases from multiple unit 
events, or events affecting multiple units. 
For additional information, refer to appendices B, F, and G. 
Guidance 
The applicant should complete bounding scenarios involving modelling of potential effects from 
maximum possible releases, in order to establish the outer boundaries or worst-case scenarios for 
the reactor facility. These bounding scenarios also contribute to the scenarios used for emergency 
planning. 
Assessments of releases or disturbances associated with normal or routine operations should be 
based on expected performance (for example, average concentrations) and upper threshold 
bounding conditions, as well as possible pulse releases (high concentration with short exposure 
period) from anticipated operational occurrences. 
The locations of the reactor facility and of the subsidiary structures on the site should be 
examined at a high level, with the assistance of environmental modelling. Such structures should 
be located so as to minimize potential effects on the public and on the environment (for example, 
emission or effluent release points, and air or water intake structures). 
The estimates of releases and disturbances used in risk modelling should be re-evaluated during 
the assessment of the construction licence application, when the design and safety features of the 
reactor facility have been confirmed. The applicant should re-evaluate risk modelling continually, 
as operating experience is gained over the reactor facility’s lifecycle. 
July 2022

The applicant should identify reference areas that will be unexposed to project interactions but 
close enough to be similar to the special areas or activities (see table A). These reference areas are 
used to detect project effects relative to changes in background conditions. Reference areas 
should be sampled during baseline conditions to establish the natural differences from exposure 
sites. The baseline should be characterized sufficiently to allow for a statistically significant 
assessment of project effects. Two or more reference areas should be identified, in order to 
characterize natural spatial variability in measured parameters as a “noise” factor to be accounted 
for when monitoring to detect project effects.

3.3.5 
Population and emergency planning considerations 
An exclusion zone is “a parcel of land within or surrounding a nuclear facility on which there is 
no permanent dwelling and over which a licensee has the legal authority to exercise control” (see 
REGDOC-3.6, Glossary of CNSC Terminology [9]). 
To support the achievement of safety objectives, the site evaluation shall take the following 
population and emergency planning considerations into account: 
• 
the planning basis as described in REGDOC-2.10.1, Nuclear Emergency Preparedness and 
Response, version 2 [10] 
• 
population density, characterization and distribution within the emergency planning zone, 
with particular focus on existing and projected population densities and distributions in the 
region including resident populations and transient populations (note: this data is to be kept 
up to date over the lifecycle of the reactor facility) 
• 
present and future use of land and resources 
• 
physical site characteristics that could impede the development and implementation of 
emergency plans (for example, the ability to deliver fuel in a timely manner to backup 
generators) 
• 
populations, including vulnerable populations, in the vicinity of the reactor facility that are, or 
may become, difficult to evacuate or shelter (for example, schools, prisons, hospitals) 
• 
ability to maintain population and land-use activities in the emergency planning zone at levels 
that will not impede implementation of the emergency response plans 
Before submitting the application for a licence to prepare site, the applicant shall confirm with the 
surrounding municipalities and the affected provinces, territories, foreign states, and 
neighbouring countries that the implementation of their respective emergency plans and related 
protective actions will accommodate the lifecycle of the proposed project. Discussions around 
early plans shall include plans and consideration of the following: 
• 
onsite response, including the capacity to bring offsite equipment onsite 
• 
ability of offsite licensee staff to communicate with and access the site during a catastrophic 
event 
• 
offsite response, and how it is coordinated between the licensee and federal, provincial and 
municipal government agencies playing a role in emergency preparedness and response 
July 2022 
REGDOC-1.1.1, Site Evaluation and Site Preparation for New Reactor Facilities 
 
17 
 
• 
how the licensee will coordinate with regulatory bodies 
• 
how the licensee will respond and coordinate with emergency service providers (fire 
department, ambulance, hospital, fuel, food, and so on) 
The applicant shall document the strategy and process for effective two-way ongoing consultation 
with emergency management agencies affected by site operations throughout the project’s 
lifecycle. Emergency management agencies include security agencies involved in the 
development of the site selection threat risk assessment report. 
Guidance 
Because of the time required for this task, the applicant should initiate these discussions during 
the early stages of site evaluation. The CNSC expects these agreements to be in place before 
granting a licence to prepare site. 
The emergency planning zones are established by the province or territory and are under control 
of the region or municipality. These zones cover the area beyond the exclusion zone that should 
be considered with respect to implementing emergency measures. 
3.3.6 
Consideration of future life-extension activities 
Where appropriate, the applicant shall consider the potential effects of longer service life, power 
uprate activities and modifications to accommodate additional or modified uses: 
• 
any proposed longer period of service life for the reactor facility 
• 
additional conventional and nuclear waste generated, as well as estimated resulting effects on 
handling, transport, and storage of waste 
• 
effects of external and human induced events on the life extension, power uprate and/or 
modification activities 
• 
effects on security and emergency planning 
Guidance 
Life extension involves the replacement or refurbishment of major components, or substantial 
modifications to the plant, or both. 
Anticipated power uprate projects represent early plans to seek to use reactor facility design 
margins and future operating efficiencies and experience, in order to increase reactor facility 
output capacity by some degree. 
Power uprate projects may also require plant modernization activities, in order to maintain 
compliance with the NSCA and associated regulations. 
For small reactors, in particular research reactors, the licensee may seek, at some point during the 
lifecycle of the reactor, to modify the design in order to accommodate additional uses (such as 
new or alternate medical isotope production, or district heating). 
3.4 
Gathering Baseline Data 
The applicant shall document and demonstrate a systematic process for gathering baseline data, 
and shall include analysis of variability and uncertainties. Baseline data shall be captured within 
auditable management systems, quality management or quality assurance programs. 
July 2022 
REGDOC-1.1.1, Site Evaluation and Site Preparation for New Reactor Facilities 
 
18 
 
The baseline data shall consider valued components (VCs) [9]. The applicant shall describe the 
general criteria used to identify VCs that may be affected by the project. The applicant shall 
identify VCs in the existing environment and use them as specific assessment end-points. The 
applicant shall identify measurement end-points, as appropriate. 
The baseline data shall also consider contaminants of potential concern (COPCs) associated with 
historical, present or proposed future use of the site. An understanding of COPCs prior to 
collecting environmental baseline data will direct the selection of parameters to be included in the 
environmental baseline data collection program. 
The applicant shall verify the baseline data collected in the initial assessment in subsequent 
periodic assessments carried out over the life of the facility. 
For more information, see section 4.5 and appendices A (section 6.3), B and C of this regulatory 
document.  
Guidance 
Where possible, baseline data should take into account archeological, paleontological, and 
prehistoric data (including the oral history of Indigenous peoples), as well as historic and 
instrumentally recorded sources. 
Baseline data should be of sufficient sample size and duration to obtain a basic understanding of 
within-year and between-year variation. For more information on specific baseline environmental 
components, see appendix B. 
As described in CSA N288.4, Environmental monitoring programs at Class I nuclear facilities 
and uranium mines and mills [11], the proposed operational monitoring program may require 
additional intensive baseline sampling for monitoring elements where a specific level, effect, or 
change in the environment is detected. 
All provincially or federally listed wildlife species occurring or reasonably expected to occur, 
within the spatial boundaries should be identified as VCs.

• 
effects on the integrity of the reactor facility’s below-grade structures, such as wet storage 
bays 
3.5.5 
Geotechnical hazards 
The applicant shall examine geological maps and other appropriate reference sources for the 
region to determine the existence of natural features that could affect the surface and subsurface 
stability of the site. 
The applicant shall assess the stability of the foundation material under dynamic, static, and 
seismic loading, with a detailed description of surface and subsurface conditions (including 
July 2022 
REGDOC-1.1.1, Site Evaluation and Site Preparation for New Reactor Facilities 
 
25 
 
hydrogeochemical effects) being incorporated into a geotechnical investigation program for the 
purposes of hazard determination and mitigation. The investigation shall describe any potential

cut slopes, dams and embankments, and waste stockpiles under static, dynamic, and seismic 
loading, using site-specific data to assess their potential effects on the nuclear facility. 
The applicant shall assess settlements (magnitude and rate) of foundations and/or foundation soils 
caused by large surface loadings and/or underground water drainage, using project-specific data. 
The applicant shall also analyze differential settlement and soil distortion as required to assess 
their potential effects on the nuclear facility. 
For underground excavations, the applicant shall analyze underground instability (rock falls and 
underground collapses) and groundwater inflow using site-specific geotechnical and 
hydrogeological data to assess the potential risks to worker safety. 
3.5.6 
Seismic and geological hazards 
Earthquakes 
The applicant shall conduct a seismotectonic evaluation for the region, using geophysical data 
and information on geotechnical hazards. The applicant shall evaluate the potential effects that 
seismic events and faults may have on sub-surface contaminant transport for the region. 
For the final selected site to be referenced in an application for a licence to prepare site, the 
applicant shall prepare a site-specific seismic hazard assessment, including a paleoseismic 
investigation and probabilistic seismic hazard analysis to develop ground motion response 
spectra. 
For nuclear power plants, the applicant shall conduct the assessment in accordance with the latest 
approved version of CSA N289.2, Ground motion determination for seismic qualification of 
nuclear power plants [19]. 
Surface faulting 
The applicant shall include an assessment of whether a fault or any part of a fault is capable, on 
the basis of geological, geophysical, geodetic, or seismological data (including 
paleoseismological, geomorphological data, etc.). 
Where applicable, the applicant shall evaluate the tsunami risk from earthquakes and/or 
landslides. 
Guidance 
A capable fault is a fault that has exhibited one or more of the following: 
• 
evidence of past movement along the fault, which occurred within the appropriate assessment 
time span; the assessment time-span is proportional to the earthquake recurrence interval or, 
movement along the fault that has occurred within the last 35,000 years (note: for highly 
active regions with short earthquake recurrence intervals, the time frame is shorter) 
July 2022 
REGDOC-1.1.1, Site Evaluation and Site Preparation for New Reactor Facilities 
 
26 
 
• 
a structural or macro-seismically determined (with instrumentation) relationship with a 
known capable fault, such that movement on one may be expected to result in movement on 
the other 
• 
the maximum potential seismic event associated with the fault is sufficiently large enough 
that it is reasonable to infer that movement at (or near) the surface could occur 
In some cases, surface evidence of past fault activity may be obscured at a particular site (for 
example, where overburden is very thick). In such instances, geological evidence from elsewhere 
along the fault within the vicinity of the site may be used to evaluate surface faulting, and to 
determine if a fault is a capable fault.

• 
section 3.5.5 of this regulatory document 
• 
NRC Regulations (10 CFR), Appendix A to Part 100 – Seismic and Geologic Siting Criteria 
for Nuclear Power Plants [20] 
Volcanic hazards 
Where applicable, the applicant shall provide an evaluation of the potential for a volcanic event to 
occur that could affect the safe operation of the reactor facility. The evaluation shall include:

Installations [21]. 
3.5.7 
Biological hazards 
Site evaluation shall include consideration of the biological phenomena that may pose a risk to 
the safe operation of the reactor facility. 
The evaluation shall also consider the potential for unusual weather events to increase the risk of 
ventilation and cooling intake systems being clogged by biota (for example, flooding or large 
storm events can dislodge large biomasses of aquatic macrophytes, and those biomasses could 
foul the intake structures). 
The evaluation shall consider the potential for the rapid growth of pathogens in the ultimate heat 
sink and other elements of the cooling system (as it poses a potential risk to both human and non-
human biota). 
July 2022 
REGDOC-1.1.1, Site Evaluation and Site Preparation for New Reactor Facilities 
 
27 
 
The applicant shall evaluate the potential risk to human and non-human biota from biocides and 
other means of managing these biohazards. 
Guidance 
The applicant should pay particular attention to biological phenomena that may pose a risk to 
cooling water systems. The potential for the colonization and excessive growth of algae, mussels, 
or clams within these systems, and the clogging of intake structures by large quantities of 
biological material (such as aquatic plants, fishes, or jellyfish) should be considered. 
The applicant should also consider biological hazards (such as those that may be posed by rodents 
and birds) that damage or disrupt electrical or other systems within the facility. 
3.5.8 
Natural fire hazards 
The applicant shall assess natural fire hazards with respect to their potential risk to reactor facility 
safety.

region with respect to potential collisions with SSCs, generation of explosions, chemical and 
radiological hazards, and fires. 
The site evaluation shall consider the potential effects on emergency plan execution, including 
effects on evacuation routes. 
3.6.3 
Fires and explosions 
The applicant shall evaluate all potential fire and explosion events in the region that could affect 
the safe operation of the reactor facility, including: 
• 
direction and force of pressure waves and their effects on SSCs and unprotected personnel 
• 
temperature effects on SSCs and unprotected personnel 
• 
potential secondary fires and explosions generated by the primary explosion or fire 
• 
release of volatile gases, asphyxiants, or chemicals that could affect safe function of SSCs or 
harm unprotected personnel 
• 
missiles that could affect SSCs 
• 
effects that could render offsite power supplies unavailable 
• 
potential effects on emergency plan execution 
3.6.4 
Chemical and radiological hazards 
The applicant shall evaluate all chemical and radiological hazards in the region that could affect 
the safe operation of the reactor facility, with particular focus on: 
• 
activities that involve the handling, processing, transport, and storage of materials with the 
potential for explosions, or the production of radioactive materials, volatile and reactive

Note: The design and safety analysis against loss of grid events is addressed in the application for 
a licence to construct. 
3.7 
Security Considerations 
In the development of security-related physical protection objectives for reactor facilities, the 
applicant shall include the gathering of information about the reactor facility’s proposed siting 
location, in order to study threats or issues presented by the geographical location and 
characteristics of the proposed site, including potential acts of terrorism. The applicant shall 
compile the findings from this study in a site selection threat and risk assessment (SSTRA) report 
(this requirement applies to new sites and to reactor facilities on existing sites). The contents of 
the SSTRA report may be merged into the licensee’s overall security program after the licence to 
prepare site has been granted. 
The SSTRA shall include comprehensive consideration of both physical protection concerns and 
transportation routes, as described in the following subsections. 
The SSTRA report shall be classified as prescribed information, and protected from release under 
access to information / freedom of information requests, on the basis of national security. 
Guidance 
Prior to initiating licensing, the SSTRA report provides the basis for identifying physical 
protection requirements and proposed mitigation strategies, to ensure that all security-related 
regulatory requirements are met. The SSTRA also identifies security concerns that may render the 
site undesirable from a security perspective. 
For more information, see appendices C and D of this regulatory document. 
3.7.1 
Physical protection 
The proposed physical protection requirements shall ensure that the appropriate detection, delay, 
and response considerations are taken into account. 
Physical protection design requirements are influenced by the site location. Site evaluation shall, 
therefore, address the physical dimensions of the reactor facility and its surrounding environment, 
including: 
• 
the topology of the area that can be considered a component of the overall security barrier 
design (such as line-of-sight view) 
• 
the proximity of various infrastructure elements that could adversely affect physical 
protection, such as a chemical plant that could release a noxious substance, a hydroelectric 
dam that could be accidentally or deliberately breached (resulting in flood), or an airport that 
provides significant flight traffic in the vicinity of the site 
• 
site boundaries 
• 
weather that could factor as a potential impediment to the operability of physical protection 
systems (that is, systems that monitor the operation of a reactor and which, on sensing an 
abnormal condition, automatically initiate actions to prevent an unsafe or potentially unsafe 
condition) 
• 
details pertaining to the establishment of a construction site, such as the positioning of 
perimeter fences, access and egress points, and storage of construction drawings 
July 2022 
REGDOC-1.1.1, Site Evaluation and Site Preparation for New Reactor Facilities 
 
30 
 
Guidance 
Reactor facilities located in a remote area bordered by a small population density may require 
different physical protection considerations than those that apply to reactor facilities located in a 
large urban area. 
Remote areas 
The applicant shall evaluate remote sites with respect to the anticipated time required to 
implement essential response services, including how long it will take offsite armed responders to 
reach the reactor facility. 
Guidance 
This aspect of the SSTRA should support early identification of the need for establishing an 
onsite nuclear response force capability, to ensure that a trained response group is in position 
during the construction phase of possible target sets (such as vital areas) that are part of the 
reactor facility. 
3.7.2 
Transportation routes 
The applicant shall consider the transportation routes in the vicinity of the site, to ensure that they 
are adequately taken into account during future site development activities. The routes to be 
considered include waterways, land routes and airspace, as described in the following text. 
Waterways 
The site evaluation shall include assessment of all waterways in the vicinity of the site, from the 
perspective of physical protection. For example, a waterborne vehicle – or its personnel or 
contents – may be used in a manner that may pose a threat to the reactor facility (for example, 
being an explosive risk) to disable operations, equipment, or systems, in an act of sabotage that 
could have radiological implications. 
Land routes 
The applicant shall assess all vehicular access land routes in proximity to the site, including rail 
lines, to determine the security threat they may pose to potential locations of future vital areas. 
Guidance 
Where possible, the surrounding terrain may be considered as a natural barrier in reducing 
vehicle-borne explosive risk. Where this is not possible, the applicant should consider delineating 
areas from which land vehicles must be restricted. 
Airspace 
The SSTRA shall consider the threats and risks associated with private and commercial airports, 
including associated flight pathways. This requirement involves discussions with municipal, 
provincial or territorial, and federal governments to confirm interdiction capabilities and 
coordinating points of contact.

3.8 
Management system  
The applicant shall establish a management system when it can be applied to the site evaluation 
process.  
Note: During site evaluation, the applicant should have a management system in place that 
governs the conduct of site evaluation activities. As part of an application for a licence to prepare 
the site, the applicant is expected to include a description of the management system as it 
pertained to site evaluation. 
A management system shall include: 
• 
procedures to control the effectiveness of assessments and engineering activities performed in 
the different stages of the site evaluation process 
• 
appropriate organization, planning, work control, personnel qualification and training, and 
activity verification and documentation, to ensure that the management system is carried out 
as effectively as possible 
• 
records of all work carried out in the site evaluation process 
• 
documentation of the results of studies (including models and simulations) and investigations 
in sufficient detail to permit independent review 
• 
a report that documents the results of all site evaluation work, laboratory tests, and 
geotechnical analyses and evaluations 
The applicant shall use information on frequency and severity derived from the characterization 
of the hazards resulting from external events in establishing the design basis hazard level for the 
nuclear installation. Uncertainties in the design basis hazard level shall be taken into account. 
These requirements apply to all activities that may influence safety, or that may contribute to the 
derivation of parameters that will ultimately contribute to the design basis for the site. 
Guidance 
The site evaluation process is part of the overall management system for the reactor facility (see 
section 4.4.1 and appendix A.4.1 for further information on management system requirements 
and guidance). Site evaluation activities are initiated before the reactor facility is established. 
The process of establishing site evaluation-related management system parameters should involve 
technical and engineering analyses, along with judgments that require extensive experience and 
knowledge. In many cases, the parameters and analyses may not lend themselves to direct 
verification by inspections, tests, or other techniques that can be precisely defined and controlled. 
In these cases, evaluations should be reviewed and verified by individuals or groups that are 
independent of those who did the work. 
Feedback associated with experienced engineering judgment and expertise in geotechnical 
engineering is an important aspect of assuring the quality of the site evaluation process. For 
example, in the assessment of matters such as liquefaction potential and slope stability, the 
accuracy of the evaluation results depends heavily on insight into failures that have occurred in 
comparable situations. The information gathered from these assessments should be documented 
and analyzed to provide evidence that similar failures will not occur. 
In addition to the requirements listed above, a management system should include: 
• 
data control, verification and validation

• 
data format 
• 
traceability of data 
• 
configuration control (including data, environmental, meteorological, geological, 
geophysical, survey, hydrological, biological) 
• 
measuring and test equipment 
• 
use and control of computer modelling 
• 
field and laboratory work 
• 
calculations and analyses 
• 
measures to ensure that the results of the site characterization are accurate, complete, 
reproducible, traceable and verifiable 
In addition, the management system may be graded in accordance with the importance to safety 
of the individual evaluation activity under consideration.

Decommissioning 
The site evaluation shall demonstrate how facility decommissioning at the end of the project is 
being considered in the overall lifecycle of the nuclear facility. 
Guidance 
As part of site evaluation, the applicant should consider: 
• 
the ease with which the proposed facility can be decommissioned; that is, the facility is 
designed to be readily dismantled and disposed of in a fashion that minimizes environmental 
effects 
• 
proximity and transport considerations to recycling, waste storage and disposal infrastructure

Site Preparation for a New Reactor Facility 
The applicant is required to hold a licence to prepare the site before any work is done on the site. 
As stated in section 2, no licence will be issued until the environmental assessment (EA) is 
complete. For more information on submitting an application for a licence to prepare site, see 
appendix A. 
4.1 
Role of site evaluation in an application for a licence to prepare site 
Site evaluation is integral to an application for a licence to prepare site, and the assessment of the 
results of the site evaluation is a key part of the activities carried out under a licence to prepare 
site. The application for a licence to prepare the site builds on the information gathered from the 
site evaluation, and should demonstrate that the applicant is taking into account future steps in the 
lifecycle of the proposed facility (construction, operation, decommissioning, and abandonment). 
Site evaluation also provides input information for construction, operation, decommissioning and 
abandonment: 
• 
for construction, the results of the site evaluation and, in particular, the site characterization 
are considered in the facility design and supporting safety analysis, which are in turn assessed 
as part of the review of a construction licence application.  
• 
for operation of the reactor facility, the site evaluation information is considered in the design 
and licensing basis, and carried through to the subsequent lifecycle phases, including the 
licence to operate. Information gathered during site evaluation, including the assumptions and 
bounding envelope would be reconfirmed at the continuing operation phase (this information 
would also be considered as part of the suite of modern codes and standards during a periodic 
safety review). 
• 
for decommissioning and eventual abandonment, the site evaluation is useful for the 
development of early strategies and plans to support the eventual dismantling of the facility 
and the management of waste, and to establish appropriate financial guarantees. 
4.2 
Site preparation activities 
Site preparation activities may involve construction of facility structures, systems and 
components (SSCs), including: 
• 
facility foundation structures (including support pilings) 
• 
facility intake and outlet channels and structures (including cooling ponds, cooling towers 
and related connections to the ultimate heat sink) 
• 
non-nuclear facility SSCs, such as a plant water treatment plant, if it can be shown that the 
design of these systems will be independent of the reactor technology (or technologies) being 
considered and will be sufficient for any reactor technology proposed for the site 
Selection of a specific facility technology is not required when submitting a licence to prepare 
site application, but the application must provide enough information to demonstrate that releases 
of nuclear and hazardous substances meet the bounds established in the EA and meet all 
applicable regulatory requirements. The Commission may issue a licence to prepare site with 
conditions that restrict activities to those that are not technology-dependent, until the applicant 
selects a facility technology.  
Applications for a licence to prepare a site that are submitted without the selection of a specific 
facility technology should ensure that the bounding parameters encompass all technologies under 
consideration. In this case, the application should include all design information that is necessary 
July 2022 
REGDOC-1.1.1, Site Evaluation and Site Preparation for New Reactor Facilities 
 
34 
 
to support proposed site preparation activities (for example, plant footprint excavation, and 
excavation of cooling water intake tunnels). 
In most cases, programs, processes and procedures developed at the licence to prepare site stage 
will continue to be used, and will be adapted to support future phases of the project (for example, 
facility construction and operation). 
The applicant should also describe the process that will be followed if new information is 
acquired that may invalidate or cast doubt on information previously submitted to the CNSC. 
Activities performed at this stage in the development of a future nuclear site are similar to those 
found at any large-scale construction/land development project; however, because the 
undertaking is a licensed activity under the Nuclear Safety and Control Act (NSCA), the applicant 
must clearly demonstrate the protection of health, safety, security and the environment. For this 
reason, in addition to the technical information describing the facility’s design and physical 
layout, the applicant must address all of the CNSC’s safety and control areas (SCAs) except 
human performance management, fitness for service, and packaging and transport as part of the 
application for a licence to prepare the site. (Note that, for site preparation, basic human 
performance management aspects are addressed under the management system SCA). 
4.3 
Management system 
The management system shall have provisions for effective management of site characterization 
and evaluation, site preparation, design, construction, commissioning and technical support 
functions (including contractor management) being performed under the licence to prepare site so 
as to promote and assure safety. 
Management system arrangements shall demonstrate adherence to CSA N286, Management 
system requirements for nuclear facilities [26], or equivalent standard established in the licensing 
basis, as applicable to the relative project phase. 
The provisions of the management system extend to contracted workers (contractors) who are 
implementing activities under the oversight of the applicant organization. 
In cases where there may be the need for early procurement of SSCs to accommodate early use or 
long (critical path) procurement spans (for example, long-lead items), the respective design and 
safety analysis, and supply chain programs, processes and procedures shall be in place. 
Where the applicant plans for a different management system and organizational structure for the 
future construction and operation of the plant, the applicant shall provide overall arrangements 
(including those for the transition to construction to commissioning to ensure continuity). 
The assessment of the results of the site evaluation is a key part of activities carried out under a 
licence to prepare site. The applicant shall describe the management system that governed the 
conduct of site evaluation activities (see section 3.8, Management system for site evaluation). 
Guidance 
This section should describe the applicant’s management system being implemented for the 
management and control of all licensed activities. The description should demonstrate that 
appropriate provisions integrating safety, health, environmental protection, security, and quality 
have been implemented for all safety-related activities. This section should also describe 
July 2022

35 
 
measures taken to ensure the implementation and observance of the management system 
programs, processes and procedures. 
If external contractors are working onsite, the applicant’s oversight of contractor activities should 
be documented, including: 
• 
contractor’s representatives performing site preparation activities, showing the line of 
accountability to the applicant’s organization 
• 
organization chart for the site activities for which the contractor is responsible 
• 
contractor’s level of authority for site activities 
• 
oversight provisions by the applicant for the activities of the contractors 
Provisions for an effective management system include: 
• 
appropriate provisions for integrating safety, health, environmental protection, security, and 
quality for all site preparation activities, and for understanding and promoting a safety culture 
• 
measures taken to ensure the implementation and observance of the management system 
programs, processes, procedures and practices 
• 
provisions for personnel responsible for compliance to have direct access to senior levels of 
the applicant’s management structure, to ensure that their needs and concerns receive 
adequate consideration 
• 
a description of organizational structure; including authorities, accountabilities and 
responsibilities of positions; internal and external interfaces; and how and by whom decisions 
are made 
• 
management system documentation that describes the corporate and site management 
structures of the applicant, of major technical support organizations, of the designer, and of 
major contractors and sub-contractors 
For more information, see RD/GD-369, Licence Application Guide: Licence to Construct a 
Nuclear Power Plant [32]; especially: 
• 
the general considerations and the operations management processes for guidance on 
management system and management structure for future project steps 
• 
section 8.3.1 for guidance on long-lead items 
4.3.1 
Human performance and safety culture 
The management system sets expectations for, and supports, human performance and is 
instrumental in understanding and promoting a safety culture. It provides the means by which 
work is to be carried out safely and the processes to understand and improve the safety culture. 
Safety culture is applicable to all the activities that may affect health, safety and the environment, 
and it applies to all personnel involved in every phase of the facility’s lifecycle. A healthy safety 
culture in the site preparation phase increases confidence in the licensee’s future performance in 
later licensing steps. 
4.3.2 
Management system for design activities during site preparation 
At this stage in the project lifecycle, it is important to ensure that design activities are managed 
according to the design organization’s management system for the reactor technologies under 
consideration. Design control measures, in the form of management system processes, procedures 
and practices, ensure consistent quality of the design of facility systems, structures and 
July 2022 
REGDOC-1.1.1, Site Evaluation and Site Preparation for New Reactor Facilities 
 
36 
 
components. High-quality design, and design management, serve to minimize latent design flaws 
that may manifest themselves as safety issues later in the facility’s life. 
Design includes and is not limited to: 
• 
technical activities that start with the identification of conceptual input and that produce 
documentation 
• 
process and the result of developing the concept, detailed plans, supporting calculations and 
specifications for a nuclear facility and its parts 
• 
engineering/technical and safety analyses and assessments 
Design management includes and is not limited to: 
• 
demonstration of sufficient competent managerial and suitably qualified and experienced 
technical staff to carry out its safety functions, make safety judgments and to comply with 
any regulatory requirements 
• 
demonstration of adequate control and supervision arrangements to ensure that the 
responsible authority is in control of its undertakings 
• 
provisions to: 
• 
monitor performance, compliance, cultural attitudes and behaviours, and take appropriate 
action (monitoring may include audits, surveillance, surveys and participation in design 
verification activities) 
• 
determine that there are adequate numbers of suitably trained, qualified and experienced 
staff 
• 
verify that the technology, tools and methods used are proven and are established on the 
basis of best industry practice 
• 
assess the technical and safety assessment capabilities in the context of the reactor 
technology organization being an intelligent user of consortium members and 
subcontractors 
• 
ensure the product and/or work produced is of appropriate quality, through review and 
acceptance of engineering deliverables 
• understand the relevance of the product and/or work to the relevant safety case or safety 
cases 
The process of establishing site evaluation-related management system parameters should involve 
technical and engineering analyses, along with judgments that require extensive experience and 
knowledge. In many cases, the parameters and analyses may not lend themselves to direct 
verification by inspections, tests, or other techniques that can be precisely defined and controlled. 
In these cases, evaluations should be reviewed and verified by individuals or groups who are 
independent of those who did the work. 
Feedback associated with experienced engineering judgment and expertise in geotechnical 
engineering is an important aspect of assuring the quality of the site evaluation process. For 
example, in the assessment of matters such as liquefaction potential and slope stability, the 
accuracy of the evaluation results depends heavily on insight into failures that have occurred in 
comparable situations. The information gathered from these assessments should be documented 
and analyzed to provide evidence that similar failures should not occur.

4.3.3 
Design of the nuclear facility - design control measures 
The design programs, processes, procedures and practices for the selected facility technology 
shall satisfy the applicable criteria for management systems established in the licensing basis; for 
example (as applicable): 
• 
REGDOC-2.5.2, Design of Reactor Facilities: Nuclear Power Plants [6] 
or 
RD-367, Design of Small Reactor Facilities [33] 
• 
CSA N286, Management system requirements for nuclear facilities [26] 
The design organization, if different than the applicant, shall have a management system 
compliant with the requirements in CSA N286. Where the applicant or reactor technology 
organization’s design programs, processes procedures and practices are structured to standards 
other than CSA N286, the applicant shall demonstrate how these satisfy the applicable criteria of 
CSA N286. 
Applicable portions of the management system shall be in place before any design activities are 
undertaken. 
Guidance 
The applicant should demonstrate that design organization’s management system has been 
reviewed, adequately implemented and accepted. 
4.3.4 
Where a specific facility design has been selected 
For reactor technologies under consideration whose design parameters are included in the 
application for a licence to prepare site, the design management system of the reactor vendor 
should be assessed to ensure it meets the requirements of CSA N286, Management system 
requirements for nuclear facilities [26]. 
4.3.5 
When facility design selection is deferred  
Guidance 
In cases where the selection of a specific facility design is deferred, the management system 
should include: 
• 
programs, processes, procedures, execution plans, and so on for the selected project execution 
model and contracting strategy 
• 
a description of the organization, including: 
• 
interrelationships 
• 
areas of responsibility, including where the applicant retains and exercises overall project 
and management system responsibility; limits of authority; and boundaries between the 
applicant, designer (usually the design authority up to some point during facility 
construction and commissioning), major technical support organizations, constructor and 
consortium members, and major sub-contractors 
• 
provisions for assuring effective management control has been and will continue to be 
exercised for the design (including the design authority), to promote and assure the safety 
aspects of work being performed 
• 
provisions for assuring proper implementation and observance of the management system

4.4 
Operating performance 
For activities conducted under the licence to prepare site, the applicant shall characterize the risks 
to health, safety and the environment that may be encountered by workers and the public. 
The applicant shall outline the strategy that the applicant will take (including development of 
mitigation measures) upon discovery of additional risks to the health and safety of the public that 
were not anticipated during the licence application process. 
Guidance 
These risks are generally similar to those encountered during pre-construction activities at a 
conventional large-scale construction project. Some examples are: 
• 
noise hazards, primarily from blasting activities and operation of heavy machinery 
• 
dust from overburden and rock removal and movement 
• 
chemical hazards from fuel spills, and conventional chemicals used during the construction of 
non-nuclear plant structures 
• 
mechanical hazards from excavation, earth movement, road building, and so on 
• 
ground vibration and flying rock hazards from blasting activities 
• 
electrical hazards from establishing construction electrical infrastructure 
The applicant should assess risks to the health and safety of workers and the public resulting from 
the activities encompassed by the licence to prepare site. This assessment includes consideration 
of accidents and malfunctions that could occur during site preparation activities (including those 
that might originate from adjacent nuclear facilities, where applicable). 
Where risks to the health and safety of either workers or the public could be higher than for a 
conventional project, the applicant should provide credible research supporting the potential 
consequences, and measures to mitigate the risks. For example, if site investigation has indicated 
the presence of a sub-surface hazardous substance, the applicant should provide an investigation 
of the effects of that substance, if unearthed, on the health and safety of workers and the local 
public. 
For more information on radiation protection, see section 4.7. 
4.5 
Safety analysis 
The applicant shall conduct a hazard analysis focusing on activities under this licence. For 
information to support the hazard analysis, see sections 4.8, Conventional health and safety and 
4.9, Environmental protection. 
4.6 
Physical design 
As explained in appendix A, the applicant is required to provide certain information based on 
their decision for an exclusion zone. The following subsections provide information on how the 
applicant may decide on the proposed boundaries for this zone. 
An exclusion zone is a parcel of land within or surrounding a nuclear facility on which there is no 
permanent dwelling and over which a licensee has the legal authority to exercise control [9]. 
July 2022 
REGDOC-1.1.1, Site Evaluation and Site Preparation for New Reactor Facilities 
 
39 
 
Physical design also applies to safety-important civil work and to the layout of areas, structures 
and systems. 
4.6.1 
Exclusion zone and emergency planning zones 
The applicant shall provide information on the proposed exclusion zone (including size and 
boundary) and on the proposed emergency planning zones. For more information on 
considerations, see section 3.3.5. 
Whether the technology has been chosen or not, the exclusion zone size is characterized based on 
a combination of dose limits, security and robustness design considerations, meteorological 
conditions and emergency preparedness considerations that are affected by the land use around 
the site. The applicant shall consider the following criteria (for an operating unit) in determining 
the size of the proposed exclusion zone: 
• 
committed whole-body dose for average members of the critical groups who are most at risk 
at or beyond the exclusion zone boundary, is calculated in the deterministic safety analysis 
for a period of 30 days after the analyzed event 
• 
under normal operating conditions, the effective dose at the exclusion zone boundary to a 
person who is not a nuclear energy worker shall not exceed 1 mSv over the period of one 
calendar year 
• 
under anticipated operational occurrence (AOO) conditions, the effective dose at the 
exclusion zone boundary to a person who is not a nuclear energy worker shall not exceed 
0.5 mSv over the release time due to the AOO 
• 
under design-basis accident (DBA) conditions, the effective dose at the exclusion zone 
boundary to a person who is not a nuclear energy worker shall not exceed 20 mSv over the 
release time due to the DBA 
• 
demonstration that the dispersion model used for the dose calculations is representative of the 
actual site 
The applicant may use either of two acceptable approaches in determining the location of the 
exclusion zone boundary. Both approaches (described below) use site characterization 
information from the site evaluation. 
For more information, see CSA N288.2, Guidelines for calculating the radiological consequences 
to the public of a release of airborne radioactive material for nuclear reactor accidents [34]. 
Approach 1: Simplified exclusion boundary case 
A specific distance for the boundary from the facility may be selected, based on predicted 
bounding values for radiological dose and exposures to hazardous substances (along with 
assumptions of facility robustness and emergency preparedness capabilities of the site and 
surrounding area). Key considerations are: 
• 
this approach requires only high-level design information for the types of facilities being 
considered 
• 
if assumptions are correct, the boundary location will be conservatively located and will 
maximize options for locating structures on the site 
• 
the site footprint may be larger than that used for approach 2 
There may be implications for the construction and operations phases. At a later licensing stage, it 
may be determined that the exclusion zone boundary is too close to the facility, or the 
assumptions regarding releases to the environment during normal and accident conditions are not 
July 2022 
REGDOC-1.1.1, Site Evaluation and Site Preparation for New Reactor Facilities 
 
40 
 
met. Mitigating actions may be required; these actions could include facility design changes or 
changes to the facility’s operating parameters. An extension of the exclusion zone boundary later 
in the licensing process would likely involve significant regulatory reviews, because of the 
relationship between the exclusion zone boundary and technical areas such as security and 
emergency preparedness. 
Approach 2: Comprehensive exclusion boundary case 
Using a systematic process, a detailed case is developed for the exclusion zone boundary location, 
based on predicted values for radiological dose and exposures to hazardous substances (along 
with assumptions of facility robustness and emergency preparedness capabilities of the site and 
surrounding area). Key considerations are: 
• 
there is greater certainty that the design(s) proposed for the site will not require extensive 
design changes to meet exclusion zone radiological dose and hazardous substances exposures 
criteria 
• 
the site footprint is optimized from the onset of the project 
• 
a detailed exclusion zone case must rely on detailed facility design information; for example: 
• 
descriptions of all major SSCs that could significantly influence the course or 
consequences of principal types of accidents and malfunctions 
• 
implications for emergency preparedness based on the physical layout of the facility 
• 
security considerations 
For more information, see sections 3.3.4 and 3.3.5. 
Emergency planning zones 
The applicant is required to provide certain information about the emergency planning zones. For 
more information, see section 3.3.5. 
4.6.2 
Civil structures and civil works 
As pertaining to the licence to prepare site, the application shall include information on the design 
measures such as flood protection and erosion control.  
Guidance 
The application should also provide information on any safety-important civil work carried out 
during site preparation and on civil structures used in site preparation (for example, containment 
dykes, retaining walls, earthworks). 
4.6.3 
Layout of areas, structures and systems 
The applicant shall present the proposed layout of structures in the final layout state (to the extent 
practicable). 
For each proposed plant design and proposed layout(s) of areas, structures and systems of the 
nuclear facility (or facilities), the applicant shall provide: 
• 
satellite or aerial photographs of the site and surrounding region, with a resolution scale of 
1:1,440 or better, including the proposed exclusion zone and site boundary 
• 
topographical map(s) for each site layout in 1:50,000 to no smaller than 1:250,000 scale for 
all structures and associated infrastructure (all drawings are to scale and include a legend) 
• 
proposed layouts of labelled structures, including: 
July 2022 
REGDOC-1.1.1, Site Evaluation and Site Preparation for New Reactor Facilities 
 
41 
 
• 
reactor building 
• 
turbine-generator block 
• 
auxiliary power buildings (for example, diesel generators) and related fuel storage 
• 
switchyard 
• 
cooling tower structures, water intakes and outlets 
• 
large structures (for example, machine shops or storage buildings for parts inventory) in 
the immediate vicinity to the proposed nuclear facility 
• 
proposed conventional and radiological waste transfer and storage areas 
• 
layouts of all site roads and proposed transmission corridors 
• 
locations of transportation corridors in the vicinity of the site (for example, rail lines, 
shipping lanes, roads, proximity to airports) 
Guidance 
Map and photograph resolution criteria are not considered to be prescribed information under the 
NSCA. The resolution scales listed above provide sufficient detail for review of the proposed 
layout(s) of the nuclear facility (or facilities). 
4.7 
Radiation protection measures 
The applicant shall assess the doses to workers associated with activities to be encompassed by 
the licence to prepare site, or from exposures to any radioactive substances resulting from past or 
present nuclear activities (for example, discovery of contaminated soils during excavation). 
The dose assessment shall demonstrate that the predicted annual effective dose, including the 
committed effective dose associated with annual intakes of radionuclides, to workers during site 
preparation will: 
• 
not exceed the applicable dose limits of the Radiation Protection Regulations 
• 
be as low as reasonably achievable (ALARA), social and economic factors taken into account 
The applicant shall consider any associated mitigation measures that are technically and 
economically feasible. In particular, the applicant shall identify engineering controls to be applied 
to reduce the magnitude of each source, and work practices aimed at controlling radiation 
exposure of workers; and shall adopt mitigation measures as appropriate. 
Guidance 
The radiation protection measures should address the information provided in section 11 of 
RD/GD-369, Licence Application Guide: Licence to Construct a Nuclear Power Plant [32] and 
should be commensurate with the hazards that may be encountered. 
4.8 
Conventional health and safety 
The production and use of nuclear energy is under federal jurisdiction. When in the presence of a 
federal undertaking, and integral to the operation and management of that undertaking, the labour 
relations and working conditions – which includes occupational health and safety (OHS) – also 
fall under federal jurisdiction.  
The regulation of OHS in nuclear power plants may involve three regulatory agencies: 
• 
Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC) 
• 
the provincial ministry of labour where the site is located 
July 2022 
REGDOC-1.1.1, Site Evaluation and Site Preparation for New Reactor Facilities 
 
42 
 
• 
the CNSC 
The applicant shall develop, implement and maintain occupational health and safety (OHS) 
programs to prevent occupational injuries and illnesses. 
The applicant shall identify OHS hazards, assess the associated risks, and ensure the necessary 
materials, equipment, programs and measures are put in place to effectively manage, control and 
minimize those risks. 
The applicant shall ensure the OHS policies and procedures of the applicant and of all contractors 
engaged by the applicant for purposes of site preparation comply with the applicable 
provincial/territorial requirements. 
Guidance 
Governance of OHS matters is determined by analyzing and identifying the applicable 
jurisdiction for each case. OHS matters at nuclear facilities usually fall under the responsibility of 
the Labour Program at ESDC, but licensee organizations in certain provinces be governed by 
provincial laws. This excludes federal jurisdiction over OHS matters at nuclear facilities that are 
operated by provincial crown corporations. 
For provinces and territories where the governance over OHS matters has not been formally 
assigned by law, jurisdiction and governance over OHS issues remain with ESDC and the 
Canada Labour Code, Part II. 
The applicant’s health and safety organization shall: 
• 
be qualified and make adequate provision for the protection of the health and safety of 
persons 
• 
meet the requirements in the applicable provincial or federal codes 
• 
adequately execute the proposed worker health and safety policies and procedures described 
in this regulatory document; for example: 
• 
demonstrating adequate oversight of the site OHS program 
• 
ensuring compliance with applicable OHS regulations and requirements 
• 
ensuring adequate OHS training of persons involved in site preparation activities 
• 
having capabilities for reporting and investigation of incidents and significant events 
4.9 
Environmental protection 
For reactor facilities, environmental protection includes requirements in addition to 
REGDOC-2.9.1, Environmental Principles, Assessments and Protection Measures, 
Version 1.1 [2]. 
Applicants for a licence to prepare site must also: 
• 
describe the protection measures for accidents and malfunctions that may occur during site 
preparation 
• 
fully demonstrate that they meet the requirements of: 
• 
CAN/CSA-ISO 14001, Environmental management systems – Requirements with 
guidance for use (2004 edition or successor editions) [35]

4.9.1 
General considerations for environmental protection 
The applicant shall demonstrate that all reasonable precautions are being taken to control and 
monitor the release of nuclear substances or hazardous substances to the environment resulting 
from site preparation activities and ensure that licence limits are being respected.  
The applicant shall demonstrate that the proposed environmental protection policies, programs 
and procedures needed for the subsequent licensing phases have been established. 
All applications for new reactor facilities shall include an environmental risk assessment (ERA). 
For more information, see REGDOC-2.9.1, Environmental Protection: Environmental Principles, 
Assessments and Protection Measures, Version 1.1 [2]. 
As described in REGDOC-2.9.1 and as applicable to site preparation activities, the applicant shall 
describe the proposed: 
•

Guidance 
Although hazards of a malevolent nature are not described in this section of the licence 
application, the applicant should consider the emergency response to those hazards; note that the 
effects of such hazards are likely to be similar to those of conventional accidents and 
malfunctions. 
The program should contain the following elements: 
• 
a training program for emergency response personnel, commensurate with evolving hazards 
at the site 
• 
a site hazard change program that, when implemented, can inform emergency preparedness 
staff of changing hazards on the licensed site to maintain adequate emergency response 
capability for all potential accident situations (note that a sufficient notification process 
should be implemented to allow emergency response organizations to adequately prepare 
prior to the introduction of new hazards on the licensed site)

into the security program, the security program shall contain plans for annual familiarization 
visits to the facility by members of an offsite response force. 
Written arrangements (for example, memorandum of understanding or other such agreement) 
with the offsite response force shall consider response time to an incident. If the response time is 
not reasonable, the applicant shall describe additional controls (for example, alarms or remote 
surveillance) to ensure the offsite response force has sufficient time for an effective intervention. 
Guidance 
Written arrangements should also consider other emergency response requirements of the 
response force (for example, natural disasters) and specific training limitations of the members of 
the force. Response-time analysis should be clearly presented and credible for the environmental 
conditions of the site and the capabilities of the offsite response force (for example, weather, 
geography, layout of roads, and recall time for off-duty staff). 
4.12.6 Physical security 
The applicant shall consider security measures relating to detection, delay and response to 
security events. Security measures should address adverse weather conditions that could impede 
the effectiveness of the measures (for example, heavy snowfall preventing security patrols,

relationships between the applicant and contractors used in the performance of site evaluation activities. 
Guidance 
A clear and direct oversight presence in every aspect of site evaluation should be demonstrated. 
B.3 
Process for gathering baseline data 
Guidance 
The applicant should document the process for reviewing the credibility and quality of data collection and 
the analysis methods used by consulting companies. Limitations and data gaps in the quality and 
completeness of baseline information should be identified and addressed. Specific attention should be 
paid to the adequacy of baseline data collection for those elements of the environment to be carried 
forward into future licensing phases with the objective of monitoring for a specified level of change in 
some environmental parameter or analyte. This process requires specific statistical study design 
considerations as outlined in CSA N288.4, Environmental monitoring programs at Class I nuclear 
facilities and uranium mines and mills [11].  
Where sampling is used to gather field data, standard sampling techniques and approaches should be from 
recognized government agencies and peer-reviewed published scientific literature for the appropriate 
technical discipline (for example, groundwater monitoring, fish monitoring).  
Guidance contained in The Inspector's Field Sampling Manual [60] may be considered. This manual sets

Appendix C: Baseline Data used to Evaluate Suitability Throughout the Lifecycle of 
the Nuclear Facility 
C.1 
General considerations 
A comprehensive site evaluation includes a demonstration of the applicant’s understanding of site-
specific and regional baseline characteristics and their effect(s) on site operations. The site baseline data 
shall be sufficiently robust to support site evaluation claims. 
Adequate and sufficient baseline data is required to confirm that: 
• 
predicted effects of external events on the site are credible 
• 
predicted effects of external events on site events, the predicted environmental effects and the testing 
of those predictions are credible 
• 
the proposed plant design and the design of site infrastructure to be established are adequate 
Guidance 
For each site baseline data topic, the applicant should justify the size of the local and regional study areas 
used for that topic. 
The applicant should describe uncertainties and types of uncertainties (for example, natural randomness, 
insufficient knowledge, and sampling or measurement error). 
The applicant should demonstrate that the process used for each type of data collection is managed in a 
process consistent with the applicant’s management system. The results of the site baseline 
characterization should be accurate, complete, reproducible, traceable and verifiable. 
The applicant should identify and address limitations and data gaps in the quality and completeness of 
baseline information, including specifying the deviation from a reference condition that would be 
considered an adverse effect (taking into consideration the normal natural variation for that parameter). 
This analysis can be done through the implementation of statistical design into baseline studies. 
The applicant should establish reference sites used to track changes that are not project-related, but that 
coincide with project activities (for example, bird nesting habits). This information is important to support 
site findings on baseline characterization of species occurrence. The applicant should specify the selection 
basis and planned use of reference sites. 
Site baseline data submissions should, where appropriate, also provide details on the present human 
population distribution and land use and indicate how each of the topics described in appendix B  has 
affected population distribution and land use (for example, seasonal floods may have rendered a particular 
area near the site unsuitable for industrial development). 
C.2 
Baseline climate, meteorological data and air quality data 
Guidance 
Information should include: 
• 
prehistoric, historic, and instrumentally recorded climate data sources that reflect the regional 
conditions (for example, the “Canadian Climate Normals” webpage [18])

65 
 
• 
five years of regional meteorological data to evaluate the potential environmental effects on the 
surrounding areas, or one year of site-specific meteorological data for the most recent one-year 
period: 
• 
this information should provide the atmospheric dispersion in the vicinity of the site and the 
surrounding areas 
• 
the assumptions used should be clearly identified under a separate header 
• 
conservatism should be addressed 
•

is not provided, an explanation should be included); for example: 
• 
air masses 
• 
general airflow 
• 
pressure patterns 
• 
frontal systems 
• 
temperature and humidity conditions 
• 
information about the ambient air quality of the study areas prior to the initiation of the project 
• 
a description of the methods used to identify nuclear and hazardous substances that will be included 
in the baseline air quality characterization 
• 
topographic descriptions of the site area and information about local (site) meteorological parameters: 
• 
the information provided should establish that the data represents conditions at the site and its 
immediate vicinity 
• 
the location of onsite meteorological stations and other local sources of meteorological data 
should be described with respect to local topographic characteristics that could affect: 
• 
local airflow patterns (for example, local circulation conditions, such as “drainage flow”) 
• 
meteorological parameters (for example, temperature and humidity) 
• 
if the site is located close to a lake, information about land-lake interactions 
• 
extreme (minimum or maximum) and average values of meteorological variables for regional and 
onsite locations, including: 
• 
air temperature 
• 
relative humidity 
• 
precipitation 
• 
wind speed and direction 
• 
atmospheric pressure

solar radiation 
• 
information about rare (infrequent) and other meteorological phenomena, owing to their possible 
effects on facility safety; for example, tornadoes, hurricanes (blizzards, dust and sand storms, 
drought, ice storms, hail and lightning 
Five years of meteorological data should be used. Site-specific meteorological data may be used if it 
covers the most recent five-year period. The applicant should verify that the data covering the most recent 
one-year period is representative of the conditions at the site. If the data is not representative, then the 
five-year average data should be used. 
The applicant should identify the locations of all meteorological and air quality data collection stations on 
an appropriately sized topographical map, and should include a justification of their locations. 
The regional and local meteorological data should be appropriate as bases for: 
• 
evaluation of potential changes in normal and extreme values 
• 
severe weather phenomena 
• 
air quality conditions resulting from: 
July 2022

• 
site preparation 
• 
facility construction 
• 
facility operation 
• 
decommissioning 
• 
site abandonment 
Data on regional climatological and local meteorological conditions and phenomena should be adequate 
as bases for assessing the: 
• 
effects on design and siting of the reactor facility and its heat dissipation system 
• 
effects on the atmospheric environment resulting from site preparation, station construction, 
operation, decommissioning, and abandonment 
Baseline information should demonstrate consideration of criteria contained in the following IAEA safety 
guides:

NS-G-3.2, Dispersion of Radioactive Material in Air and Water and Consideration of Population 
Distribution in Site Evaluation for Nuclear Power Plants [8] 
• 
SSG-18, Meteorological and Hydrological Hazards in Site Evaluation for Nuclear Installations [15] 
For baseline air quality data, air quality assessment results should be compared against applicable 
provincial and federal air quality criteria and objectives, such as annual, 24-hour and one-hour maximum 
acceptable concentrations. Precise guidance can be obtained from provincial regulations and standards. 
For complete hazardous substance analysis, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are compared to ozone; 
to particulate matter related to total suspended particulates (TSP); to particulate matter < 10 µm (PM10); 
and to particulate matter < 2.5 µm (PM2.5). Sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx) and carbon 
monoxide (CO) are included in the analysis. 
For nuclear substance analysis, tritium oxide and tritium gas, carbon 14, noble gases, iodine-131, and 
particulates are to be included in the analysis.

Baseline surface water, sediment and groundwater quality data 
The applicant shall evaluate the baseline surface water quality, sediment quality and groundwater quality 
relative to established standards, criteria, guidelines and/or objectives, to ensure that changes due to a 
given project do not pose a present, imminent, or long-term risk to human health and the environment. 
C.5.1 
Contaminants of potential concern 
Guidance 
Concentrations of contaminants of potential concern (COPCs) in groundwater, surface water and 
sediments should be measured at detection limits that allow comparison to criteria and objectives 
(“benchmarks”) that protect human and/or aquatic life. The benchmark selection for each COPC should 
be supported by scientific literature that justifies its use for the proposed site. 
C.5.2 
Baseline surface water quality 
The applicant shall report baseline surface water quality, including general water quality parameters (for 
example, pH, conductivity, temperature, and dissolved oxygen). The expected COPCs shall form the basis 
of the parameters to be analyzed in baseline surface water samples. 
The application shall include sample station locations, along with the justification for their selection and 
statistical basis (number of samples and variability) by which “baseline” is defined. 
July 2022 
REGDOC-1.1.1, Site Evaluation and Site Preparation for New Reactor Facilities 
 
71 
 
Guidance 
The focus should be on those parameters expected to change as a result of project activities assessed 
throughout all licensing stages. 
Baseline surface water quality data should be initially screened against recognized water quality 
guidelines, such as the Canadian Environmental Quality Guidelines [65] . Where federal or provincial 
standards or guidelines are not available or where natural background as documented in an appropriate 
baseline study demonstrates the water quality standards or guidelines are not applicable, benchmarks from 
the peer-reviewed scientific literature may be used with appropriate rationale. Site-specific water quality 
objectives may be developed with the support of the scientific literature and the application of the 
procedures for deriving numerical water quality objectives as documented in the Canadian Environmental 
Quality Guidelines. 
For more information, refer to the Canadian Environmental Quality Guidelines [65], specifically the 
Canadian Water Quality Guidelines for the Protection of Aquatic Life. 
C.5.3 
Baseline sediment quality 
The applicant shall report on baseline sediment quality, including sediment physical parameters (for 
example, pH, total organic carbon, and particle size analysis). The expected COPCs shall form the basis 
of the parameters to be analyzed in baseline sediment samples. The application shall include sample 
station locations, justification for their selection and statistical basis (number of samples and variability) 
by which “baseline” is defined. 
Guidance 
The focus should be on those parameters expected to change as a result of project activities assessed 
throughout all licensing stages. 
Baseline sediment quality data should initially be screened against federal sediment quality guidelines, 
such as the Canadian Environmental Quality Guidelines [65]. Where an appropriate baseline study 
demonstrates that natural background exceeds the available standards or guidelines (or that none exist for 
the COPC of interest), sediment quality benchmarks from the peer-reviewed scientific literature should be 
used with appropriate rationale. 
C.5.4 
Baseline hydrogeology and groundwater quality 
The applicant shall determine and report baseline groundwater quality, including pH, conductivity and 
turbidity. The expected COPCs shall form the basis of the parameters to be analyzed in baseline 
groundwater quality samples. The report shall include sample station locations, justification for their 
selection and statistical basis (number of samples and variability) by which “baseline” is defined. 
Guidance 
The focus should be on those parameters expected to change as a result of project activities assessed 
throughout all licensing stages. 
Baseline groundwater quality data should be compared to federal water quality guidelines, such as the 
Canadian Environmental Quality Guidelines [65]. If federal or provincial standards and guidelines are not 
available, water quality benchmarks from the peer-reviewed scientific literature should be used with 
appropriate rationale.

Groundwater elevations and hydraulic heads 
The acquisition and interpretation of groundwater level and hydraulic head measurements are important 
elements of hydrogeological characterization. Aquifer physical properties and hydraulic head 
measurements allow the rates and directions of groundwater flow to be estimated. 
Groundwater elevations and hydraulic heads should be presented as contour maps. Seasonal variations 
should also be presented. 
Lithological logs, well construction drawings and borehole geophysical logs 
Lithological logs, well construction drawings and borehole geophysical logs are used to develop and 
support hydrogeological characterization, groundwater monitoring programs, and groundwater 
remediation. 
Hydrogeological cross-sections 
The applicant shall document site-specific hydrogeological cross-sections. 
Guidance 
Hydrogeological cross-sections illustrate the distribution of geological materials and hydraulic properties 
that control groundwater flow and influence contaminant transport. Identification of vertical and 
horizontal groundwater flow paths supports hydrogeological characterization, groundwater monitoring 
programs and groundwater remediation. The resulting hydrogeological cross-sections provide a basis for 
interpreting and illustrating contaminant distributions. 
Cross-sections should incorporate available geological and hydrogeological information, including 
lithological logs, cone penetrometer logs, borehole geophysical logs, surface geological mapping, surface 
geophysical surveys and trench logs. Cross-sections should be drawn to scales that depict important site 
features. Cross-sections and accompanying maps should be maintained using the same scales. 
Cross-sections should depict the interpretation of hydrostratigraphy (that is, the mapping of surface and 
sub-surface water flow pathways for characterization and remediation activities). The rationale for the 
interpretation should also be documented. Cross-sections should be amended as additional monitoring or 
geological data are developed. If new data result in significant changes to the conceptual models, the 
results should be reported. Final drawings should accompany both draft and ongoing remedial 
investigation reports. 
Structure contour maps 
The applicant should provide site-specific geological structure contour maps illustrating the interpreted 
elevation of geological contacts, thickness of geological units and the saturated thickness, extent, and 
overall geometry of hydrostratigraphic zones. If new data result in significant changes to the conceptual 
models, the changes should be reported. Final drawings do not need to be submitted until the draft 
remedial investigation report is due. 
Site-specific structure contour maps should use the same scale(s) as groundwater. Contour intervals 
should be selected commensurate with the density and precision of the data. 
Maps should be amended (and include the amendment date) as additional monitoring or geological data 
are developed.

Groundwater elevation contour maps and potentiometric surface maps 
Groundwater elevation contour maps provide for illustration and interpretation of the horizontal 
distribution of hydraulic head across a study area. These maps, combined with knowledge of aquifer 
hydraulic properties, estimate rates and directions of groundwater flow (and associated contaminant 
transport) within specific hydrostratigraphic zones. 
The applicant should provide groundwater elevation contour maps for each water-bearing zone, to 
illustrate the extent of water-bearing zones, horizontal groundwater flow directions, and to support 
interpretation and illustration of the groundwater flow system. 
Site-specific groundwater elevation maps should be drawn to scales that depict important site features. 
Groundwater elevation contour maps illustrate the horizontal distribution of hydraulic head. The vertical 
distribution of hydraulic head should be illustrated on cross-sections. All potentiometric data used to 
develop individual contour maps should be from the same hydrostratigraphic zone and possibly from the 
same relative position. Groundwater elevation contour maps should incorporate all potentiometric data 
from a single groundwater elevation survey for the hydrostratigraphic zone illustrated. Groundwater 
elevation data should be posted with the well identification on each map. 
Aquifer properties 
The applicant shall document estimates of the hydraulic properties of hydrostratigraphic units. These 
estimates shall include hydraulic conductivity and porosity of aquifers and aquitards, and the 
transmissivity and storage coefficient of aquifers. This information aids in subsequent determinations of 
monitoring locations and frequencies, predictions of contaminant fate and transport, and design of 
remedial measures. 
The applicant shall identify the method used to estimate hydraulic properties, whether from pumping 
tests, slug tests, or laboratory tests of core samples. 
Guidance 
The applicant should document anisotropy of hydraulic properties. The range and spatial distribution of 
hydraulic conductivity and/or transmissivity should be depicted in graphical form, on maps and cross-
sections. 
Rates and directions of groundwater flow 
The applicant shall use hydraulic properties, in conjunction with water level and gradient information, to 
estimate rates and directions of groundwater flow, the rate of transfer of water between aquifers, and the 
capture zones of wells. 
Guidance 
The application should include any chemical or isotopic tracer data that provide constraints on fluid 
direction, flow velocity or mixing. 
The rates and directions of groundwater flow in each hydrostratigraphic unit should be described using 
potentiometric data and hydraulic properties, t and depicted on maps and cross sections.

use near and around the proposed plant. 
Guidance 
Characterization should include maps showing the locations of the groundwater supplies. 
Baseline water quality 
Baseline water quality, including general water quality parameters, shall be documented. 
Guidance 
The sample locations and statistics used to define baseline water quality should be justified. 
Well purge and recovery rates, well volume, purge volume, temperature, specific conductance and any 
other parameters measured in the field should be reported for each well sampled. 
Graphs illustrating historical analytical data for COPCs should be provided for selected wells. Trends in 
concentrations should be interpreted and described. 
C.6 
Baseline terrestrial flora, fauna and food chain data 
Aquatic mammals, waterfowl, amphibians and aquatic-associated reptiles (for example, turtles) are 
included in this category. Information about the terrestrial biotic environment to be obtained for the site 
and surrounding areas shall include:

on and in the site’s vicinity (including abundance, critical habitat, and life histories that include 
critical life stages, biologically significant activities, seasonal habitat requirements, trophic, and 
interspecific relationships)

mortality effects on fauna (birds, mammals, amphibians, reptiles, and invertebrates) 
• 
identification of any conservation status species (that is, species designated at risk by a government 
agency, that are known to occur, or have the potential to occur within the zone of influence of project 
activities), and including an assessment of the importance of the habitat within that zone for these 
species 
•

• 
description and map of boundaries of the proposed project in a regional context, showing existing and 
planned future land use, and existing infrastructure 
The biotic characteristics of the proposed site shall be identified and documented, while taking into 
account environmental considerations such as: habitats essential to maintaining the viability of potential 
VCs, designated protected habitats, areas containing migratory routes of important species, and areas of 
high biological production. 
Characterization shall also contain a description of soil types at the site and within local and regional 
study areas and the quantitative baseline data of the soil characteristics that are most likely to influence 
future assessments and required for modelling purposes (e.g., pH, soil bulk density, soil moisture 
content). 
Guidance 
Documentation of biota using habitat at the proposed site should include descriptions of communities of 
birds, mammals, and reptiles. This information helps to identify interactions between the project and the 
biological components of the area, to predict potential environmental effects, to identify mitigation 
measures, and to evaluate the significance of the residual effects when the mitigation measures are 
applied. Biological data play an important role in the identification of potential VCs, which are used as 
the final receptors in pathways modelling. 
Background information should be documented for understanding the potential changes in, or effects on, 
the terrestrial environment and the adequacy of environmental monitoring programs to identify these 
potential changes. Consideration should be given to the need for and design of wildlife population 
monitoring (for example, spatial distribution, abundance, and density) to put residual adverse effects into 
proper context for those species at risk. Population monitoring is complex and requires estimates with 
minimum bias and maximum precision. 
The area of consideration may extend beyond the regional study area to include potential VC home 
ranges, critical habitats, and migration corridors. The boundaries in space and time take into account the 
home range, migration corridors and dispersal areas of potentially affected species. The VC information is 
used to adjust the assessment spatial and temporal boundaries. 
For commercially or recreationally valuable species, the applicant should list the types of wildlife and 
plants that could be adversely affected by the proposed facility. The provincial, local conservation 
agencies or organizations that maintain harvest level records of these species should be identified.

Appendix E: Prediction of Effects of the Environment on the Project over the 
Lifecycle of the Nuclear Facility 
A comprehensive site evaluation includes a demonstration of the understanding of the effects of credible 
site-specific and regional natural and human-induced external events that could affect site operations for 
each phase of the facility lifecycle. 
The largest effects during the project lifecycle are expected to occur during the site preparation and 
construction stages. Project activities resulting in large and certain environmental effects during site 
preparation and construction include land re-contouring and water-body infill work. 
Early planning ensures that natural and human-induced external events are considered when evaluating 
environmental effects on health and safety and on security mitigation measures. 
Information on external events shall be provided to determine, for the entire lifecycle of the project, that: 
• 
the predicted effects of external events onsite events and the subsequent analyses of environmental 
effects are credible 
• 
the facility design and the design of site infrastructure are adequate 
• 
the licensee will ensure adequate provisions for the protection of the environment, the health and 
safety of persons, and national security 
E.1 
General considerations 
All design-basis parameters arising from consideration of natural and human-induced external events 
shall be identified, and their design basis values justified. These “site-related” parameters influence the 
design basis values for the nuclear facility and are an important input to the design and overall safety 
case. 
The process used for each type of event analysis shall be consistent with the overall management system. 
Limitations presented by data used in the study shall be clearly documented for future use. 
For each of the following sections, any parameters having an influence on the design of the facility 
(design basis parameters) shall be identified, and their design basis values given and justified. All design 
basis parameters and their values arising from siting considerations shall be documented. 
For the licence to prepare site application, where multiple technologies are being considered, the plant 
design parameters for each of the technologies being considered for the facility shall be provided, so as to 
demonstrate that each of the technologies is capable of withstanding the design basis conditions attributed 
to siting considerations. 
Guidance 
The analysis of postulated events should address combinations of events that are credible for the site and 
its surrounding region, and may have a larger cumulative effect than the events in isolation. 
Some examples of design basis parameters are maximum/minimum air temperatures, maximum snow 
load, maximum seismic ground motion, extreme flood, maximum tornado wind speeds, and maximum 
loadings arising from events on nearby transportation routes.

E.2 
Potential change of the climate and environment 
The applicant shall document the detailed steps and procedures used for assessing the effects of climate 
change on the site.  
Guidance 
For more information, see Incorporating climate change considerations in environmental assessment: 
general guidance for practitioners [71].  
Effects predictions should have sufficient detail for follow-up verification (for example, quantitative 
expression of change, such as percent loss; degree of confidence in prediction [related to type of 
evidence]; roles of mitigation, detailed compensation and performance monitoring; and a rationale for the 
importance of the follow-up and mitigation provisions.) 
Effects predictions should include: 
• 
temperature, humidity, evaporation, high winds, abrasive dust and storms, precipitation, and lightning 
• 
water levels and temperature changes of open water bodies (lakes, bays, and oceans), river floods and 
droughts (flow rates) 
• 
groundwater level, flow pattern and velocity change resulting from changes of surface water recharge 
and evaporation 
• 
earthquakes and landslides, and so on, due to changing sea and lake levels and melting glaciers 
Effects predictions should pay additional attention to potential environmental effects on the water systems 
of the project, due to: 
• 
ice from water bodies (lake or river ice) or frazil ice in forebay 
• 
suspended silt 
• 
bio-fouling due to biofilms, attached algae, mussels, fish 
Effects predictions should consider the effects of climate and environmental change on populations of 
non-human biota that could adversely alter predicted environmental effects due to site activities or 
introduce new potential environmental effects. The mitigation plans for prevention or reduction of plant 
intake fouling should take into account projected effects of climate change, including frazil ice and bio-
fouling (mussels, algae, marine plants). 
Future meteorological conditions (that is, accounting for climate change) and the extent of thermal plume 
from modelling should be used as a basis for extrapolating the long-term ice conditions / silt / fish / 
mussel / algae density observations for source water body and future potential for effects on the project. 
Experience with similar operating facilities, such as thermal and nuclear power plants using the same or a 
similar source water body, should also be considered. 
E.3 
Prediction of meteorological events 
Guidance 
The application should document a systematic approach for identifying meteorological events for the site 
and surrounding region (natural external events). This approach includes steps for continued data 
collection for meteorological events over the project’s lifecycle, such as information that shows that the 
representative data series is complete, of adequate quality and all sources are identified for verification. 
The application should document the verification of the appropriateness, limitations and rationale of the 
statistical distributions for the data sets.

E.5 
Water supply adequacy 
Guidance  
The application should describe the approach for identifying water supply adequacy for the site and 
surrounding region. This approach should include the steps for continued data collection over the 
project’s lifecycle.  
Water supply adequacy studies should consider: 
• 
reliability and availability of water supply (considering existing water-taking projects in the region, 
and the potential for additional water-taking projects that could exist in the region) 
• 
water supply changes from naturally induced failures of offsite structures, such as dams, flood control 
dykes 
• 
if groundwater is used as the water supply: groundwater levels, flow patterns, pumping rates, water 
quality and the effects on water quality during flooding or drought events (for example, excess 
minerals released into groundwater during flood events) 
For more information, see SSG-18, Meteorological and Hydrological Hazards in Site Evaluation for 
Nuclear Installations [15]. 
E.6 
Prediction of groundwater, geotechnical, seismic and surface faulting events 
The application shall document the investigation and evaluation of the site’s and surrounding areas’ 
susceptibility to the following events over the project’s lifecycle, and shall address: 
• 
groundwater related events (groundwater flow and contaminant transport) 
• 
geotechnical events 
• 
seismic and surface faulting events 
Guidance 
The application should provide information on the effects of: 
• 
groundwater conditions: 
• 
groundwater flow patterns, rates and groundwater level influence the risk of seismic events, and 
the stability of slopes and foundations 
• 
the adverse effects of groundwater conditions on site preparation should be evaluated by 
combining the groundwater conditions with the geotechnical analysis 
• 
geotechnical events: 
• 
slope instability 
• 
underground collapse and/or rock fall 
• 
subsidence or uplift of the site surface 
• 
instability of the soil foundation due to static or dynamic loads

geotechnical events on future site activities by combining qualitative explanations with the results of 
quantitative analyses 
• 
seismic events and surface faulting events: 
• 
surface faults and lineaments in the regional, local and site scales are identified 
• 
the potential for these faults to be seismogenic and seismotectonic should be evaluated 
• 
their effects on future site activities should be assessed 
• 
mine-induced seismic events, where applicable, and their effects on the structures, systems and 
components (SSCs) 
• 
liquefiable soil units should be identified, and their effects on structures and site preparation 
should be assessed

E.7 
Prediction of non-malevolent biological events 
The applicant shall use a systematic process for characterizing and prioritizing risks of external biological 
events over the project’s lifecycle, with emphasis on the facility’s operational phase. This process requires 
a well characterized biological baseline to allow for the prediction of the effects of biological hazards for 
the project (episodic events and ongoing hazards) and testing mitigation performance. 
Analyses shall characterize potential biological phenomena that could affect facility SSCs, such as: 
• 
plant matter, mussels or fish impingement events (for example, smelt runs) that could block water 
intakes 
• 
bird species, insects or other fauna that may nest near or in air intakes (which could result in 
blockages of air intakes and pathogens or chemically reactive agents from nesting areas entering air 
systems) 
• 
moulds, organisms or pathogens, either naturally present or generated by site activities (for example, 
cooling tower mist or algae in cooling water ponds), which could chemically react with SSCs and 
may result in reduced reliability of systems if not mitigated in design (for example, lichens 
chemically attacking concrete), and affect human health, either on- or offsite 
• 
algae or micro-organisms in thermal plume of the facility outlet that could degrade the quality of 
water entering intakes for drinking and personal hygiene or affect plant intake water quality 
• 
wildlife that could potentially reside within the facility structures and systems and cause damage or 
long-term degradation 
Guidance 
Mitigation strategies to counter postulated biological events should demonstrate an effort to minimize 
effects on the environment and the health and safety of workers and the public. 
If any credible biological events are postulated, a description of a follow-up monitoring plan should be 
documented. The plans should include methods to test the performance of mitigation of those biological 
hazards.

E.8 
Prediction of non-malevolent external fire and explosion events 
Non-malevolent external fire and explosion events occur outside the boundaries of the site, but have the 
potential to have a credible effect on site operations or the execution of emergency plans. 
The examination of postulated accidents and malfunctions events and their mitigating strategies shall 
address: 
• 
the effects of postulated non-malevolent external fire and explosion events for each phase of site 
development 
• 
environmental effects 
• 
site security program 
• 
site and regional emergency plans for the project 
• 
history of significant non-malevolent external fire and explosion events in the region surrounding the 
site 
• 
fire and explosion risks that may develop from changes in land use around the site (for example, 
industrial growth) 
• 
the effects of climate change that may increase the risks or effects of postulated fire events (for 
example, increased wind speed, drier weather conditions, increased lightning) 
• 
effects on the ability to maintain effective site security during and following these events 
• 
effects on the health and safety of workers and the public, where these events interact with activities 
performed under the licence (for example, if the event causes a secondary fire in a chemical storage 
area, which causes an explosion or release of combustion products) 
• 
emergency response requirements posed by these types of events (for example, fire response, 
chemical spill-control and response) 
Guidance 
The examination should also address: 
•

Appendix F: Assessment of Non-Malevolent Accidents and Malfunctions, 
 and of the Consequences 
The applicant shall demonstrate that the facility is capable of safely operating within the constraints of the 
proposed site. Environmental effects shall be as low as reasonably achievable over the full lifecycle of the 
proposed facility, while taking mitigating measures into account. 
Any design information provided by the applicant shall be credible and sufficient to adequately bound the 
evaluations of environmental effects and site evaluation. 
Regardless of the approach used with regards to applying facility design information to their site selection 
case, the applicant shall demonstrate a clear understanding of the basis from which the safety case is 
developed. 
F.1 
Considerations specific to the licence to prepare site 
F.1.1 
Decision-making considerations 
Decisions by the Commission on an application for a licence to prepare site under the Nuclear Safety and 
Control Act (NSCA) for a nuclear reactor project may be made with high-level facility design information 
from a range of reactor designs without specifying the technology to be constructed. 
The applicant shall provide sufficient information to describe the plant-site interface and take into 
consideration the characteristics of the proposed site. A combination of site characteristics and bounding 
design parameters will be the focus for comparison with the design characteristics of the actual plant 
selected for the application for a licence to construct. 
If the applicant chooses to pursue a licence to prepare site without choosing a final technology for the site, 
the activities permitted under the issued licence to prepare site will be limited to site preparation activities 
that are independent of any specific reactor technology (for example, clearing and grading the site, 
building site support infrastructure such as roads, site power, water and sewer services). 
F.1.2 
Considerations that will carry forward to an application for a licence to construct 
The design that is eventually selected for construction need not be specifically referenced in the 
application for a licence to prepare a site, but the design shall fit within the bounding envelope in the 
approved environmental assessment (EA) and licensing process. The evaluation of the design would be 
performed once a reactor technology is selected. This evaluation will be required to be demonstrated as 
part of an application for a licence to construct, or for an amended licence to prepare site, where the 
applicant wishes to carry out activities such as excavation to bedrock for the plant foot print, or 
excavation of cooling water intake and outlet tunnels (note that concrete pour will not be permitted under 
a licence to prepare site). 
The less facility design information that is provided in regulatory review processes for a licence to 
prepare site, the greater the burden will be on the construction licence review process. 
An underpinning concept of the bounding approach is that the environmental effects of the reactor design 
eventually selected for construction should be less than the bounding effects assessed in the application 
for a licence to prepare site. Similarly, if the site is deemed suitable to host nuclear units using bounding 
July 2022 
REGDOC-1.1.1, Site Evaluation and Site Preparation for New Reactor Facilities 
 
92 
 
parameters, then the site should also be suitable for any reactor design that falls within the accepted 
bounding envelope. 
F.1.3 
Criteria for level of design detail for an application for a licence to prepare site 
At the application phase for a licence to construct (or for an amended site preparation licence, as 
described above), the applicant shall submit detailed design information to verify that the evaluations 
presented previously remain valid. 
Information required to support site evaluation around the assessment of accidents and malfunctions for 
the licence to prepare site includes: 
• 
a technical outline of the facility layout 
• 
qualitative descriptions (or technical outline) of all major structures, systems and components (SSCs) 
that could significantly influence the course or consequences of principal types of accidents and 
malfunctions 
• 
qualitative descriptions (or technical outline) of the functionality of the SSCs important to safety 
• 
qualitative descriptions of principal types of accidents and malfunctions to identify limiting credible 
sequences that include external hazards (natural and human-induced), design-basis accidents and 
beyond-design-basis accidents (severe accidents) 
For site evaluation carried out in support of licensing (including emergency planning purposes), the 
applicant shall address severe accident sequences. The severe accident sequences include, where 
applicable, simultaneous multiple unit events, with loss of grid/station blackout events, and events with a 
simultaneous loss of offsite power with loss of normal access to the ultimate heat sink for an extended 
period of time. Considerations shall also include radioactive sources such as the wet storage bay (also 
called irradiated fuel bay or spent fuel pool). 
The applicant shall provide a description of out-of-core criticality events showing that these events would 
not violate criteria established by international standards and national guidance as a trigger for a 
temporary public evacuation. 
The applicant shall demonstrate that the safety goals and functional requirements are met. 
Guidance 
In situations where the technology to be used onsite has either not been selected (subject to a technology 
selection process that will occur either during or beyond site preparation) or the technology being 
considered is a first of a kind in Canada (design not yet fully developed), detailed quantified information 
about accidents and malfunctions characteristics may not be fully established. As a result, the CNSC will 
accept qualitative information in support of the site selection case with the understanding that there will 
be an increased level of regulatory scrutiny during the construction and operation licensing processes to 
validate the claims made. 
The applicant should demonstrate that safety goals and functional requirements are met through a high-
level safety analysis that demonstrates that the behaviour of the reactors being proposed is understood, 
and that their consequences can be accurately predicted. 
For more information on safety goals, see:

F.2 
Considerations applicable to all licensing phases 
The applicant’s site evaluation information shall describe possible malfunctions or accidents associated 
with the project, the probability of occurrence, and the potential adverse environmental effects of any 
event sequence that may result in hazardous substance releases or large releases of energy (such as steam 
or electrical arcs) over the facility’s lifecycle and the set of corresponding bounding plant parameters that 
will form the design basis. 
The applicant shall address severe accident sequences. These sequences include, where applicable, 
simultaneous multiple-unit events, with loss of grid / station blackout events, and events with a 
simultaneous loss of offsite power with loss of normal access to the ultimate heat sink for an extended 
period of time. Considerations shall also include radioactive sources such as the wet storage bay (also 
called irradiated fuel bay or spent fuel pool). 
Guidance 
The applicant should provide information on future phases, to demonstrate that site evaluation is being 
maintained with a long-term view. 
F.2.1 
Assessment of non-malevolent conventional accidents and malfunctions events 
Conventional accidents and malfunctions are potential events that result in the release of non-radiological 
hazardous substances or large releases of energy. 
For the facility’s technology to be constructed and operated on the site, the applicant shall provide 
documentation to demonstrate that the safety goals and functional requirements established for 
non-malevolent conventional accidents and malfunction events are met through safety analysis, showing 
that the behaviour of the design is understood and that consequences can be accurately predicted. 
Guidance 
The applicant should consider the following items in the establishment and maintenance of the bounding 
site and facility parameters: 
• 
past (in the context of existing facilities adjacent to the selected site) and potential abnormal plant 
operations, accidents and spills of relevance 
• 
malfunction and accident events that have a reasonable probability of occurring during the project’s 
life, and that may involve the release of non-radiological hazardous substances or large release of 
energy that could significantly affect the environment 
• 
the source, quantity, mechanism, rate, form and characteristics, spatial and temporal extent of above-
background levels of contaminants and other materials (physical, chemical, and so on) likely to be 
released to the surrounding environment during the postulated malfunctions and accidents 
• 
the effects of contaminant releases from conventional accidents and malfunctions on human health 
and the environment 
• 
mitigation means and measures, including policy, procedures and plans to mitigate, prepare for, 
respond to, and recover from emergencies from accidents and malfunctions (including emergency 
response and preparedness) 
•

should show that emergency response within and external to the site will be sustainable for the 
facility’s lifecycle 
F.2.2 
Assessment of non-malevolent nuclear accidents and malfunctions 
The information considered shall be in line with level of plant design information available at each 
licensing phase while considering later licensing risks. The CNSC will consider application of a graded 
approach to safety analysis and facility design in certain areas where the applicant can demonstrate that 
risk is low for the facility type being considered. 
Identification and classification of accidents 
Continuing site evaluation shall include consideration of unplanned events involving the reactor which 
challenge the performance of the safety functions and lead to radiological releases and releases of 
hazardous substances to the environment. 
The applicant’s information shall identify and describe the principal types of accidents in the categories 
described below including the rationales for selecting these sequences as representative accidents. 
Events involving the nuclear reactor are classified as follows: 
• 
anticipated operational occurrences 
• 
design-basis accidents 
• 
beyond-design-basis accidents, including severe accidents 
For site evaluation carried out in support of licensing (including emergency planning purposes), the 
applicant shall address severe accident sequences.  
Calculation of accident consequences 
The applicant shall assess the representative accident sequences in these categories of accidents to 
determine releases of fission products and the potential releases of nuclear and hazardous substances from 
the facility. 
For anticipated operational occurrences and for design basis accidents, the applicant’s information shall 
demonstrate that designs would be capable of meeting the dose limits specified in REGDOC-2.5.2, 
Design of Reactor Facilities: Nuclear Power Plants [6]. 
The applicant shall document the potential offsite releases of radioactive products from representative 
severe accident sequences.  
The applicant shall describe: 
• 
the source term (for example, list of radionuclides, magnitude and timing of the release) 
• 
a description of the process followed to arrive at the final list of radionuclides 
• 
where applicable, a justification of the basis for screening out radionuclides that are not included. 
Meeting safety goals 
The applicant shall consider quantitative safety goals to ensure that the individual and societal risks to life 
and health posed by the facility to the public living nearby shall be comparable or less than the risks of 
viable competing technologies, and shall not significantly add to other societal risks.

The applicant’s information shall demonstrate that the design is capable of meeting safety goals.  
Guidance 
The applicant should describe the results and insights from analyses regarding the representative accident 
sequences used to define the safety goals. 
Two safety goals are defined to protect the environment and the health and safety of the public: 
• 
small release frequency:  
• 
addresses releases of radioactive material that would trigger temporary evacuation of the 
population within a few kilometres of the plant to prevent unacceptable health effects resulting 
from limited reactor core damage with impaired containment 
• 
the sum of frequencies of all event sequences that may lead to a release that could trigger 
temporary evacuation shall be less than 1:100,000 per reactor year 
• 
Large release frequency:  
• 
addresses releases of radioactive material that could require long-term relocation of the public to 
prevent unacceptable health effects resulting from severe reactor core damage and containment 
failure 
• 
the sum of frequencies of all event sequences that may lead to a release that could require long-
term relocation of the public shall be less than 1:1,000,000 per reactor year 
F.2.3 
Prediction of non-malevolent radiological accidents and malfunctions occurring outside 
the reactor core and out-of-core nuclear criticality safety 
The information considered shall be in line with the level of plant design information available at each 
licensing phase while considering later licensing risks. The CNSC will consider application of a graded 
approach to safety analysis and facility design in certain areas where the applicant can demonstrate that 
risk is low for the facility type being considered. 
Identification of the source, quantity, form and characteristics of nuclear and hazardous substances 
To support the site evaluation case around the discussion of non-malevolent radiological accidents and 
malfunctions occurring outside the reactor core and out-of-core nuclear criticality safety, the applicant 
shall provide a documented description of all major systems, other than the reactor, that contain nuclear 
and hazardous substances that could be released in the environment in significant quantities during an 
accident at or near the reactor facility. The description shall include the quantity, form and characteristics 
of nuclear and hazardous substances that could be released. 
In some cases, separate facilities on the site may be available that will support the reactor facility (for 
example, wet storage bay, fresh fuel storage, nuclear waste handling and storage facilities). For each of 
these facilities, accurate records of inventory shall describe the types and quantities of nuclear and 
hazardous substances to be contained in the facilities. 
Guidance 
The applicant should also identify the radioactive sources where direct radiation may be an environmental 
hazard in accident conditions.

Identification of accidents and malfunctions 
The applicant shall characterize unplanned occurrences not involving the reactor and that may lead to 
releases of nuclear and hazardous substances to the environment. This characterization process includes 
accidents with sufficiently low frequency leading to public evacuation or relocation. 
The characterization process shall identify and describe the principal types of accident and their 
frequencies, and the rationales for selecting these sequences as representative. 
For site evaluation carried out in support of licensing (including emergency planning purposes), the 
applicant shall address severe accident sequences.  
Calculation of releases to the environment 
The applicant shall assess the representative accident sequences in these categories of accidents to 
determine the potential releases of nuclear and hazardous substances from the facility. The assessment 
shall describe: 
• 
the radiological source terms, including the limiting source terms (for example, list of radionuclides, 
magnitude and timing of the release) 
• 
the process followed to arrive to the final list of radionuclides 
• 
where applicable, a justification of the basis for screening out radionuclides that were not included 
The applicant shall demonstrate that the accident frequencies are well below the frequency limit of: 
• 
10-5 for the small release frequency safety goal for evacuation 
• 
10-6 for the large release frequency safety goal for relocation 
Additional characterization information regarding out-of-core criticality safety 
The applicant shall describe out-of-core criticality events, taking into account mitigation measures. 
Requirements for nuclear criticality safety are described inREGDOC-2.4.3, Nuclear Criticality 
Safety [78].

97 
 
The applicant shall use a systematic process to identify, assess and screen postulated malevolent acts and 
their consequential event sequences. The applicant shall describe site-specific design-basis threats and 
beyond-design-basis threats, along with the appropriate safety goals and functional requirements that will 
be met. 
Guidance 
In establishing and maintaining the bounding site and facility parameters, the applicant should address: 
• 
while intentional malevolent acts are not accidents, environmental effects resulting from malevolent 
acts should be compared with the effects identified for conventional and radiological accidents and 
malfunctions 
• 
site-related information contained in the site selection threat and risk assessment (SSTRA) report that 
may have a bearing on the events 
• 
events that may involve radioactive or nuclear material in and out of the core 
• 
events that may involve quantities of hazardous substances, with the potential to create significant 
environmental effects 
• 
events that may involve the large release of energy, with the potential to create significant 
environmental effects 
For each of the event sequences postulated, the applicant should consider: 
• 
source, quantity, mechanism, rate, form and characteristics of contaminants and other materials 
(physical, chemical and radioactive) likely to be released to the surrounding environment during the 
postulated event 
• 
mitigation means and measures, including the applicant’s policy, processes, procedures and plans to 
mitigate, prepare for, respond to, and recover from emergencies for malevolent act event sequences 
(including security needs) 
• 
contingency, clean-up or restoration work in the surrounding environment that would be required 
during, or immediately following, the postulated malevolent initiated event sequence 
• 
measures, provisions and safeguards to protect against the postulated malevolent act event sequence 
• 
event or accident management policy and procedures for design basis events 
• 
beyond-design-basis malevolent initiated event sequences 
• 
supporting infrastructure external to the site (exclusion zone) 
This process may use the consequence analysis of non-malevolent events used in the assessment of the 
effects of the site activities on the environment.

Appendix G: Effects of the Project on the Environment 
G.1 
General considerations 
The applicant shall provide adequate and sufficient information on the environmental effects of the 
project so that it can be determined, for the entire lifecycle of the project, whether: 
• 
siting option choices were made to avoid or reduce environmental effects 
• 
the facility design and site infrastructure designs are adequate to meet regulatory requirements 
(including the exclusion zone boundary, where appropriate) 
• 
the applicant will ensure adequate provision to protect health, safety, security and the environment 
Assumptions used in the prediction of the project’s effects on the environment over the project lifecycle 
shall include information about facility operations under normal conditions, and during accidents and 
malfunctions. 
Nuclear and hazardous wastes that will be generated over the nuclear facility’s lifecycle shall be 
described in the predictions of effects on the environment (for example, the location, inventory and 
disposal of used nuclear fuel are considered). 
The applicant shall document the evaluation of the proposed approach for environmental effects 
monitoring for the current licensing phase, including projected minimum detectable critical effect size, 
and the confidence associated with the design of the monitoring and baseline data. 
Guidance 
The goal of monitoring is to generate information for informed decision-making on whether the applicant 
will make adequate provisions for the protection of the environment for activities being conducted under 
the current licence. 
Provision for environmental protection should be based, in part, on criteria and recommendations that are 
relevant to the current licensed activities, such as those from the Environmental codes of practice for 
steam electric power generation: construction phase [80]. For example, for activities being conducted 
under a licence to prepare site, information should include appropriate environmental protection practices 
in site surface preparation activities, and plans for environmental inspections, for performance verification 
monitoring for predicted effects, and for mitigation. 
Effects predictions and statistical approaches should be documented and used (for example, random 
sampling wherever feasible) for testing these effects predictions according to published protocols. Effects 
predictions for pulse exposures (for example spills, accidental or intended releases, silt and storm water 
runoff events) should be developed appropriately, because they have different requirements than 
predictions for continuous exposures. 
G.2 
Effects of the project on air quality 
The applicant shall document the evaluation of the proposed approach for environmental effects 
monitoring for the current licensing phase, including projected minimum detectable critical effect size, 
and the confidence associated with the design of the monitoring and baseline data. 
July 2022 
REGDOC-1.1.1, Site Evaluation and Site Preparation for New Reactor Facilities 
 
100 
 
Guidance 
The goal of monitoring is to generate information for informed decision-making on the likelihood and 
significance of adverse effects from activities being conducted under the current licence. 
The applicant should: 
• 
characterize the effects of emissions of nuclear and hazardous substances from the project to the 
atmosphere during normal operations and during postulated accident and malfunction scenarios 
• 
assess the potential effects of atmospheric nuclear and hazardous substance emission to air quality for 
each phase of the project, and the ability of the described mitigation measures in eliminating or 
minimizing any adverse effects 
Air quality assessments should include, as applicable: 
• 
information on project-related emission sources from stationary and mobile sources 
• 
information on point source emissions 
• 
information on proposed pollution-control technologies, including environmental effects; the 
information should be prepared with an awareness of pollution-control technologies available in the 
industry 
• 
analysis of: 
• 
the facility’s air emissions, using emission estimates that are “conservative” (reasonably expected 
to exceed the actual emission rates) or with an accurate emissions scenario that assumes operating 
conditions resulting in the highest concentrations at offsite receptors 
• 
emission rates and the duration of elevated rates of emission during plausible accident or 
malfunctions scenarios  
• 
anticipated frequency and duration of warm and cold start-ups and present emissions of key pollutants 
under these start-up and any other lower-efficiency scenarios 
• 
descriptions of appropriate atmospheric dispersion modelling, to predict effects at the project 
exclusion zone boundary, fence line and offsite 
• 
models and techniques that are consistent with guidelines such as: 
• 
Air Dispersion Modelling Guideline for Ontario [81] 
• 
relevant modelling guidance published by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 
• 
standard dispersion modelling results, including maximum offsite 1-hour and 24-hour concentrations 
(for comparison with applicable standards and objectives), frequency analysis for any offsite 
dispersion that has exceeded limits, and maps of dispersion modelling results 
• 
description of the cumulative effect of emissions from the facility and regional air emissions or air 
quality 
• 
comparison of air-quality assessment results against applicable provincial and federal air-quality 
criteria and objectives, such as 24-hour, 3-hour and 1-hour maximum acceptable concentrations 
(precise guidance can be obtained from provincial regulations and standards) 
• 
where applicable: 
• 
potential trans-boundary air quality effects 
• 
effects on Indigenous peoples’ lands 
Proposed air quality mitigation strategies should include measures to reduce emissions or formation of 
dust and particles from construction activities and vehicles, and to minimize air emissions from the 
project during the construction phase, so as to prevent undue effects on surface water quality and any 
sensitive biological (including human) receptors downwind. For more information, see Best Practices for 
the Reduction of Air Emissions from Construction and Demolition Activities [82].

The applicant shall examine and document the effects of the proposed project on the terrestrial 
environment, including flora and fauna, including effects on wildlife corridors, protected areas, and other 
valued components (VCs). This assessment includes potential effects from project activities during site 
preparation, construction, operation, decommissioning and abandonment at the site, at both local and 
regional scales. 
The applicant shall assess the effects from the project on the terrestrial environment in a manner 
consistent with CSA N288.6, Environmental risk assessments at class I nuclear facilities and uranium 
mines and mills [7]. 
The applicant shall identify species and habitats that will be considered important ecological resources for 
the site, vicinity, transmission corridors, and other related areas for evaluation of any potential effects.

state a degree of confidence in the prediction of habitat loss (related to type of evidence) 
• 
describe the roles of mitigation, habitat compensation and performance monitoring 
• 
provide a rationale for significance and mitigation follow-up 
• 
include a discussion of any uncertainties or limitation of the assessment 
• 
specify predicted effects as the difference in attribute(s) between a future condition without the 
project, and a future with the project: 
• 
a future condition without the project has a present condition trajectory into the future, and takes 
into account any future changes in baseline factors 
• 
a future with the project has a present trajectory plus the incremental effect of the project 
The degree of detail provided in the assessment of the effects should be commensurate with the 
magnitude of the potential effects. 
Sufficient data should be provided for the assessment of anticipated effects during the period of site 
preparation, facility construction, facility operations and decommissioning. Effect descriptions should 
include direct and indirect exposure effects that could be used for the environmental effects monitoring 
and risk assessment purposes.  
July 2022 
REGDOC-1.1.1, Site Evaluation and Site Preparation for New Reactor Facilities 
 
102 
 
Information and data on the terrestrial effects should be evaluated against reliable criteria and objectives, 
so as to ensure that the information can identify likely interactions between the project and its effects on 
the terrestrial environment’s biological components. Guidance on selecting appropriate toxicological 
benchmarks is provided in CSA N288.6, Environmental risk assessments at class I nuclear facilities and 
uranium mines and mills [7].

G.4 
Effects of nuclear and hazardous substances on the terrestrial environment 
The applicant shall specify uncertainties included in the data (for example, natural randomness, 
insufficient knowledge, and sampling or measurement error). 
Guidance 
The typical variation in concentrations of nuclear and hazardous substances at reference site(s) should 
clearly demonstrate no anthropogenic point source influences. The reference site(s) should closely match 
the site of interest with respect to the geological, hydrological, meteorological, climate, human and 
environmental settings (for example, as described in CSA N288.6, Environmental risk assessments at 
class I nuclear facilities and uranium mines and mills [7]). 
The applicant should address relevant federal and provincial guidelines and include, for all cumulative 
project effects above baseline data: 
• 
detailed maps showing the proposed locations of sampling/monitoring stations for all measurements 
of nuclear and hazardous environmental concentrations 
• 
an inventory of natural and anthropogenic sources for nuclear and hazardous substances at the site 
and within local and regional study areas, including predicted/estimated concentrations of nuclear and

G.5 
Effects of the project on the aquatic environment 
The applicant shall address the effects from project activities on the aquatic environment, including 
aquatic habitat and associated aquatic biota. 
Guidance 
The applicant should address the following general areas: 
• 
the following aquatic habitats (using the parameters of habitat quality, quantity and frequency of use): 
• 
pelagic (open water) 
• 
littoral (near-shore and shallow) 
• 
benthic (bottom-associated) 
• 
riparian (shoreline) 
• 
wetland 
• 
onsite pond and streams that provide habitat for aquatic biota 
• 
the existing physically altered or contaminated habitats that were changed by past operations where 
there is an existing facility (for example, thermal discharge channels, thermal plumes and past/present 
physical disruption/structures in near-shore uplands, shoreline/riparian and water bodies) 
• 
habitat of aquatic finfish, shellfish and aquatic plants, excluding aquatic mammals, water birds, 
waterfowl and reptiles (within the scope of effects of the project on the terrestrial environment) 
• 
maps (including digital databases such as a geographic information system) that show the relationship 
of the site to major hydrological systems that could affect or be affected by plant construction or 
operation 
With effects predictions, the site evaluation: 
• 
provides a quantitative expression of change (for example, percent loss) 
• 
states a degree of confidence in the prediction of habitat loss (related to type of evidence) 
• 
describes the roles of mitigation, habitat compensation and performance monitoring 
• 
provides a rationale for significance and mitigation follow-up 
• 
includes a discussion of any uncertainties or limitations of the assessment 
• 
specifies predicted effects as the difference in attribute(s) between a future condition without the 
project, and a future with the project: 
• 
a future condition without the project has a present condition trajectory into the future, and takes 
into account any future changes in baseline factors 
• 
a future with the project has a present trajectory plus the incremental effect of the project 
Pre-project or baseline aquatic habitat classification and mapping are precursors to any decisions 
associated with aquatic habitat loss. Assessing the potential for habitat loss should include: 
• 
numerical statements on the size, frequency, duration and magnitude of change of the affected area 
and/or volume of habitat, and an assessment of how critical and unique the affected habitat is to biota 
exploiting the habitat (quantity and quality) 
Note: This information should be supported by maps showing: 
• 
areas of project activities 
• 
overlap with aquatic VC habitat in time and space (including VC home range and migration and 
dispersal estimates) 
• 
descriptions of any project effects that are physical, biological, chemical or radiological in space and 
time on the habitat, and occurrence of interacting organisms 
• 
descriptions of disturbances of land, shoreline and water bodies from activities in project phases, 
with: 
July 2022 
REGDOC-1.1.1, Site Evaluation and Site Preparation for New Reactor Facilities 
 
104 
 
• 
linkages to any expected change in aquatic habitat (for example, offshore placement of excavated 
material, placement of intake and discharge structures, cofferdams or shoreworks or shoreline 
protection) 
• 
an assessment of the water column volume and area affected by the intake water withdrawal 
• 
descriptions of past habitat loss and possible future habitat loss, to set the context for the evaluation of 
the importance of the possible future losses 
• 
justification if the benthic invertebrate community is not used as indicator of loss of fish habitat 
(because this is the food base for many fish species) 
Submissions should address the Fisheries Act. The applicant should review the proposed activities against 
the requirements of the Fisheries Act, because an authorization may be required if an activity is likely to 
cause serious harm to fish. The applicant should consult the Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) Projects 
Near Water website for further guidance on self-assessing serious harm to fish and the authorization 
application process. Depending on the location of the activity (within the proposed licence boundary or 
outside), the application would be submitted for review to the CNSC or DFO, respectively. 
The applicant should evaluate information and data on the aquatic effects against credible criteria and 
objectives, to ensure that the information is sufficient to identify likely interactions between the project 
and its effects on the biological components of the aquatic environment. For more information on 
determining the appropriate aquatic effects criteria and objectives, see:

Effects of liquid effluent on the aquatic environment 
The applicant shall address the following areas of concern: 
• 
identification of all plant-related structures or alterations of the natural topography that lead to aquatic 
contaminant inputs to receiving water bodies, floodplains or wetlands at the site 
• 
known (historical and present) aquatic contaminants found at the site and within the local and 
regional study areas, potentially affecting or affected by plant construction and operation 
• 
confirmation that the information contains sufficient linkage of hydrological mappings to known 
(historical and present) data and predicted future changes in aquatic contaminant concentrations 
Guidance 
The applicant should provide sufficient data for the assessment of anticipated effects during the period of 
site preparation, facility construction, facility operations and decommissioning within, upstream and 
downstream of the zone of influence of the intake and discharge structures. 
July 2022 
REGDOC-1.1.1, Site Evaluation and Site Preparation for New Reactor Facilities 
 
105 
 
Information should follow collective lines of evidence approaches that are recognized by provincial and 
federal government agencies; for example: 
• 
Guidelines for Identifying, Assessing and Managing Contaminated Sediments in Ontario [87] 
• 
EPA-540-R-05-012, Contaminated Sediment Remediation Guidance for Hazardous Waste Sites [88] 
The approach should project the effects on individual biota to those of the population. Information should 
be supported by peer-reviewed published scientific literature, and be based on a combination of water and 
sediment chemistry, benthic invertebrate and fish field surveys (accounting for the most sensitive VCs), 
laboratory toxicity tests and computer modelling. The approach should confirm whether there are or will 
be significant adverse effects on the aquatic community. 
Measurements and data development programs should demonstrate accepted and established and 
published aquatic contaminant sampling and modelling protocols and field study designs. 
Predicted changes to surface water and sediment quality from modelling data should be evaluated using 
criteria that ensure that surface water and/or sediment quality changes and liquid effluent input into water 
bodies do not pose risks to human health and the environment. When determining appropriate surface 
water quality criteria and objectives, the applicant should consider federal guidelines, such as the 
Canadian Environmental Quality Guidelines [65], as well as provincial guidelines and standards, and use 
water-quality benchmarks from reputable scientific literature. 
The description of zones of influence of stressors in space and time should be relative to habitat and 
occurrence of interacting organisms, specified and supportable from site studies and/or scientific/agency 
publications dealing with pulse-type and continuous release aquatic effects. 
Descriptions of effects should include direct exposure effects (for example, on survival, growth, 
reproduction, age, species distribution of community), and indirect effects (for example, altered predators, 
prey, competition, exposure via the food chain). 
To determine the dilution factors and to perform mixing zone calculations, it is expected that a 
conservative final exposure concentration of contaminants in the liquid effluents entering water bodies 
will be used in accordance with the Canadian Environmental Quality Guidelines [65]. 
G.5.2 
Effects of blasting and excavating on aquatic biota 
Guidance 
Information for this area should be commensurate with the level of blasting and excavating to be 
performed under each licence phase of the project. 
Activities should be planned to avoid critical fish habitat use times and locations within the zone of 
influence. 
The site evaluation should address: 
• 
criteria contained in Guidelines for the Use of Explosives In or Near Canadian Fisheries Waters [89] 
• 
Environment and Climate Change Canada’s total suspended solids and turbidity criteria 
• 
control/effect testing for site preparation blasting effects on aquatic biota in nearby site ditches, 
streams or ponds within the zone of influence 
• 
habitat disruption (for example, through siltation or propagation of sound pressure waves) or physical 
disruption (for example, disrupting groundwater flows to streams during spawning periods)

example, spatial distribution, abundance or density) 
The site evaluation should demonstrate that the site preparation and construction activity monitoring plan 
design is sufficient to define the magnitude, temporal and spatial extent of the source terms and effects 
(for example, spatial extent of lake bottom affected, numbers of fish killed or injured per blast 
extrapolated to whole period of activity, effects on benthic invertebrates) 
G.5.3 
Effects of impingement and entrainment on aquatic biota 
The applicant shall address the following, for each project phase: 
• 
site evaluation from the perspective of project-related intake impingement and entrainment effects on 
aquatic organisms (with an emphasis on VCs); however, total losses of all species should be 
considered, in order to ensure adequate provision for the protection of the environment 
• 
effects for all consumable and cooling water system options 
• 
defensible and testable predictions of residual adverse effects of water intakes (such as cooling water 
intakes) on aquatic biota, so that the significance of all effects of the project, and the cumulative 
effects of other projects, can be assessed 
• 
monitoring programs for entrainment and impingement should be based on peer-reviewed published 
standards, for example: 
• 
Impingement Abundance Monitoring Technical Support Document [90] 
• 
Entrainment Abundance Monitoring Technical Support Document [91] 
• 
screenings of VCs for susceptibility to intake withdrawal based on susceptibility factors 
• 
descriptions of conceptual model, linking source terms for entrainment and impingement to measures, 
and predictions of effect 
Guidance 
Impingement effects occur when large aquatic organisms, such as adult and juvenile fish, aquatic birds, 
amphibians and aquatic mammals within the source water, are drawn into plant consumable water 
systems (such as condenser cooling water). These organisms are also trapped against intake debris 
screens. The resulting impingement catch is usually automatically washed from the intake screens and 
conveyed to debris bins for disposal as waste. The mortality rate is 100 percent for juvenile fish. The 
mortality rate is the same for adult fish, unless there is a system for adult live handling and return to the 
water body. 
Entrainment effects occur when small organisms (such as fish eggs, larvae, invertebrates and plankton) 
within the source water pass through the intake screens, are transported through the consumable water 
system, and are discharged at the system outlet back into the source water body (or nearby cooling pond). 
These organisms are exposed to chemical, mechanical (impact) and thermal stresses during entrainment. 
Mortality rates vary from 25 percent to 100 percent, depending upon the type of organism and species. 
The estimates of intake losses (cropping rates) for all life stages of aquatic biota in numbers and biomass 
should be extrapolated to the whole year, with confidence intervals based upon industry-accepted 
methods of sampling and analysis. This extrapolation includes the conversion of immature stages to age-1 
adult equivalents for estimates of losses of population-level importance (for example, Defining and 
Assessing Adverse Environmental Impact from Power Plant Impingement and Entrainment of Aquatic 
Organisms [92]). Standard modelling and statistical approaches and contextual methods from government 
agencies and peer-reviewed published scientific literature should be used to project the effects on 
individual biota to those of the year-class or population. Mortality is assumed to be 100 percent from 
impingement, unless a fish handling and return system is included. The effectiveness predictions also vary 
July 2022 
REGDOC-1.1.1, Site Evaluation and Site Preparation for New Reactor Facilities 
 
107 
 
by species and life stage. For example, alewife are fragile and easily killed, whereas sucker and eels are 
not; juveniles are easily injured and do not easily withstand mechanical handling systems. 
G.5.4 
Effects of thermal plume on the aquatic environment 
The site evaluation shall address: 
• 
clear pictorial descriptions showing the locations of discharge structures and areas of influence 
(temperature, discharge jet) relative to intakes and known/suspected areas of VC-focused habitat use 
(spawning, rearing, nursery, feeding, wintering areas) and features (for example, substrates, 
bathymetry, wetlands, aquatic plants) 
• 
descriptions of models (physical, mathematical, conceptual) used to predict temperature effects and 
thermal discharge jet effects, and to account for long-term effects of climate warming relative to 
incremental effects of the project 
• 
a listing of aquatic fish and shellfish species, aquatic plants, and invertebrates, identifying which life 
stages are susceptible to exposure to the interaction, and which subset of species are most sensitive 
• 
descriptions of zones of influence of thermal plume temperature effect (greater than 1ºC above 
ambient) and physical discharge jet effect with maps and plots (for example, delta above ambient 
versus distance alongshore and offshore and incremental effect on existing thermal plumes) 
• 
descriptions of alongshore currents, including direction, speed and sediment transport and how these 
are changed by discharge plumes (deflection, distance and entrainment time for passively drifting 
biota, such as eggs, larvae) 
• 
direct consequences to the ecosystem (process, structure, function), fish and fish habitat, other aquatic 
VCs , and indirect effects (via food chain) to aquatic birds and mammals 
• 
descriptions of worst-case and average conditions of discharge water effects, including: 
• 
the effects of thermal plume on aquatic habitat temporal and spatial changes (for example, 
discharge jet interruption of ambient lake currents, scouring, temperature changes, sedimentation 
and particle size, algal cover) 
• 
consideration of risk to aquatic biota from “pulse” temperature increases and decreases relative to 
ambient changes such as thermal shock from ongoing operations, outages and anticipated 
operational occurrences 
• 
temperature predictions (mean, median, maximum and minimum) during critical life stage periods for 
potential VCs and plots of hourly maxima showing duration at peak temperatures 
• 
effects of contaminants released in the thermal discharge, including the combined effects of 
temperature and contaminants, as well as the potential for gas-bubble disease 
• 
effects on fish, including: 
• 
physical displacement of life stages exposed to discharge jets 
• 
lethal and sub-lethal effects 
• 
behavioural responses (attraction and avoidance) for all life stages 
• 
direct effects (survival, growth, reproduction, diet, condition) and indirect effects (for example, 
discharge angling mortality, increased larval mortality from predation due to physical transfer out 
of discharge channel to open water body, disease prevalence) analysis and evaluation of the 
incremental effects from the project, and the cumulative effects of combined discharges 
• 
the monitoring and sampling methodologies that will be used onsite along with descriptions of 
sampling/monitoring points and equipment 
When considering the use of a nearby large body of water as the ultimate heat sink for heat rejection (for 
example, using once-through condenser cooling water), the applicant shall predict, monitor and document 
the effects of the resultant thermal plume and the physical effects of the discharge water flow on nearby 
bodies of water. This analysis shall consider the potential effects of using cooling towers on air quality, 
terrestrial and aquatic environment. 
July 2022 
REGDOC-1.1.1, Site Evaluation and Site Preparation for New Reactor Facilities 
 
108 
 
Guidance 
The scope of information should be scaled to the scope of anticipated adverse effects. For example, a 
once-through cooling system (diffuser) would require complex analysis but cooling towers would not. 
When using a cooling pond that is separate from the body of water, the applicant should consider the 
interactions between the cooling pond and the nearby bodies of water and should mitigate any potential 
effects of cooling pond containment dike breaches. 
G.6 
Effects of the project on hydrogeology 
The site evaluation shall address effects from project activities on hydrogeology. 
Guidance 
Information should: 
• 
address the prediction and monitoring of effects of activities on: 
• 
flow patterns and rates of groundwater flow 
• 
physical, chemical, and biological characteristics of the groundwater within the site, local and 
regional areas, during site preparation, construction, operation, decommissioning or abandonment 
of the facility 
• 
describe how the hydrogeological investigations program is being conducted to permit the assessment 
of the effects of features and processes from the baseline hydrogeology and groundwater quality 
information contained in the licensing submissions 
• 
include the physical, chemical, and biological water-quality parameters, rates, flow patterns of 
groundwater flow and movements of released contaminants through local and regional groundwater 
flow systems 
• 
provide sufficient information to enable the reader to become familiar with the physiographic, 
hydrologic, hydrogeological and groundwater uses at the site and in its vicinity 
Investigations of groundwater, as well as the investigation and modelling of dispersion and retention of 
radionuclides in groundwater should demonstrate consideration of the criteria contained in NS-G-3.2, 
Dispersion of Radioactive Material in Air and Water and Consideration of Population Distribution in 
Site Evaluation for Nuclear Power Plants [8]. 
Well-supported effects predictions should be provided (for example, quantitative expression of change 
and a rationale provided for significance and mitigation follow-up). For more information, see 
Operational Policy Statement: Assessing Cumulative Environmental Effects under the Canadian 
Environmental Assessment Act, 2012 [93]. 
The applicant should assess and document the potential radiological doses and exposures to hazardous 
substances to persons, including mitigation strategies, for each phase of the facility’s lifecycle. 
G.7 
Effects of the project on human health 
The applicant shall address the following effects on the health and safety of persons: 
• 
onsite during normal operations, and during accidents and malfunctions 
• 
offsite during normal operations, and during accidents and malfunctions 
• 
for each area of concern itemized, identify and characterize appropriate human receptors  
July 2022 
REGDOC-1.1.1, Site Evaluation and Site Preparation for New Reactor Facilities 
 
109 
 
Key components of the assessment process include the identification of: 
• 
potential project-human interactions 
• 
radiological and non-radiological (that is, nuclear and hazardous substances) contaminants of 
potential concern (COPCs) 
• 
human receptors and assessment criteria 
Guidance 
Normal operations include unplanned exposures and upset conditions that do not cause an emergency to 
be declared. 
Receptor exposure characteristics (for example, inhalation or ingestion rates), when used, should be 
referenced from accepted Canadian or international sources, for example: 
• 
for hazardous substances, 2013 Canadian Exposure Factors Handbook [94] 
• 
the most up-to-date International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) references 
• 
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry 
For information on protection of workers from hazardous chemicals, see American Conference of 
Governmental Industrial Hygienists. The reason for selecting an alternate source of receptor 
characteristics should be given, with the source/citation clearly documented and accompanied by justified 
assumptions. A conservative approach should be used in assessments of project effects on human health. 
The effects documented for accidents and malfunctions should correlate with the postulated accidents and 
malfunctions scenarios. 
G.7.1 
Radiological risks 
The applicant shall describe and document the method used to estimate effective and equivalent doses. 
Guidance 
Documentation should identify radiation doses received by persons on and offsite at similar existing 
facilities (when they exist) that use the best available technology economically achievable (BATEA). This 
benchmarking exercise should be used to develop a licensing basis that achieves similar or lower doses. 
These estimates may be based on modelling of prospective radionuclide exposure (both external exposure 
and, internal exposure via intakes of radionuclides) to the identified human receptors using methods 
and/or dose coefficient acceptable to the CNSC, for example, as described in: 
• 
CSA N288.1, Guidelines for calculating derived release limits for radioactive material in airborne 
and liquid effluents for normal operation of nuclear facilities [36] 
• 
ICRP 68, Dose Coefficients for Intakes of Radionuclides by Workers [95] 
• 
ICRP 72, Age-dependent Doses to the Members of the Public from Intake of Radionuclides – Part 5, 
Compilation of Ingestion and Inhalation Coefficients [96] 
• 
U.S. EPA, Federal Guidance Report No. 12: External Exposure to Radionuclides in Air, Water, and 
Soil [97] 
For direct exposure to radiation from photon-emitting sources, methods based on Monte Carlo techniques 
and point kernel codes may also be used 
Information provided to verify the reference dose data should be demonstrated to be reliable and 
associated with workplace and work activities that represent the proposed facility-related workplace and 
work activities. 
July 2022 
REGDOC-1.1.1, Site Evaluation and Site Preparation for New Reactor Facilities 
 
110 
 
The basis for assumptions regarding exposure duration and exposure frequency should be documented. 
Calculated doses to persons, both on and offsite, should be traceable to the input data (for example, 
receptor exposure characteristics, relevant radiological data). Sample dose calculations should be included 
that demonstrate the link from input data (such as concentrations of radionuclides in air) to dose to 
persons, with all relevant assumptions provided. 
G.7.2 
Mitigation strategies 
The applicant shall ensure that mitigation strategies reflect preventive principles and are technically and 
economically feasible. Emphasis shall be placed on eliminating or minimizing hazards through design and 
engineered controls. 
The applicant shall ensure that engineered controls demonstrate that the controls reduce the magnitude of 
each radiation source and keep radiological exposures of workers as low as reasonably achievable 
(ALARA) during routine and non-routine work practices (for example, operating and maintenance 
activities). The radiological design objectives for these engineered controls shall be specified. 
The applicant shall identify administrative controls that will be used to minimize doses to workers. The 
applicant shall describe contingency responses in the event of failed engineered and administrative 
controls. 
The applicant shall demonstrate that the assessment of the significance of effects resulting from the 
project takes into account the implementation of the proposed mitigation measures. The assessment 
results shall demonstrate that the predicted effective and equivalent doses to workers and members of the 
public will be ALARA and below the applicable radiation dose limits specified in sections 13 and 14 of 
the Radiation Protection Regulations. The criteria for determining whether significant adverse effects to 
workers onsite, resulting from the accidents and malfunctions associated with the reactor facility, for each 
phase of the project are presented in section 15 of the Radiation Protection Regulations. The applicant 
shall describe all necessary measures that will be taken to evacuate any persons from site who are not 
involved in the control of the emergency situation. When the emergency has ended, and the recovery 
phase has begun, the dose limits in sections 13 and 14 of the Radiation Protection Regulations will apply.  
Guidance 
The applicant should credibly demonstrate that the design meets the dose acceptance criteria and safety 
goals defined in REGDOC-2.5.2, Design of Reactor Facilities: Nuclear Power Plants [6]. 
Doses to workers from routine and non-routine work practices should be estimated, including the 
maximum annual effective and equivalent doses to categories of workers. 
Where prevention of effects cannot be assured, the applicant should describe administrative mitigation 
controls such as personal protective equipment, training and procedures. Only mitigation measures that 
are technically and economically feasible (ALARA and BATEA) should be considered. 
G.7.3 
Hazardous substances 
Guidance 
The applicant should identify and describe: 
• 
the methods used to estimate exposure, via various pathways, of the various human receptors to 
hazardous substances 
July 2022 
REGDOC-1.1.1, Site Evaluation and Site Preparation for New Reactor Facilities 
 
111 
 
• 
the engineering controls to be applied to reduce the magnitude of each source 
When estimating the significance of the effects resulting from the project, the applicant should account 
for the implementation of the proposed mitigation measures. The assessment results should demonstrate 
that the estimated exposure to hazardous substances of persons onsite during the normal operation will 
not exceed criteria specified by Health Canada, the CCME or other agencies acceptable to the CNSC.

• 
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) 
G.8 
Prediction of non-human biota dose 
The applicant shall address non-human biota radiation dose assessment methods used to quantify effects 
for releases of nuclear substances. The scope shall include analysis of both the effects of chronic and 
acute exposures on terrestrial and aquatic organisms. 
G.8.1 
Exposure information 
The applicant shall perform explicit calculation of radiation doses to non-human biota with recognized 
approaches and software tools.  
Guidance 
The applicant should provide a high-level discussion of the relative merits of alternative approaches to put 
the presented approach in a current national and international context. 
An example of an acceptable approach is available in CSA N288.6, Environmental risk assessments at 
class I nuclear facilities and uranium mines and mills [7]. The applicant should document the details of 
transfer parameters and their validation for site conditions. Site-specific data, and/or authoritative data 
sources, should support model structure and parameter choices. The applicant should note the choice of 
food chain transfer factors for VCs, which can vary by orders of magnitude in different environments for 
different species. 
The applicant may use a software tool, if it addresses risks to VCs explicitly or by reasonable analogy. If 
an approach different from CSA N288.6 [7] is used, the applicant should describe the model structure and 
implementation. Regardless of the approach taken, the applicant should document a few representative 
samples of dose calculations starting with media and/or food concentrations. 
G.8.2 
Selection of radiation benchmarks 
For controlled releases, the applicant shall quantify and interpret doses for the effects on life history 
parameters (morbidity, mortality, reproduction). If numerical benchmarks for chronic radiation effects are 
exceeded, effects shall be interpreted at multiple levels of organization in an ecological context relative to 
the potential for effects on individual biota, populations, communities and ecosystems. 
The applicant shall describe long-term consequences of accidental releases (for example, as shown from 
studies of major nuclear accidents such as “Differences in effects of radiation on abundance of animals in 
Fukushima and Chernobyl”, published in Ecological Indicators [98]. 
July 2022 
REGDOC-1.1.1, Site Evaluation and Site Preparation for New Reactor Facilities 
 
112 
 
Guidance 
For accidental releases, the applicant should use the notional range of 1–10 Gy to describe the effects of 
acute exposure. Comparisons may only be possible for analogous organisms. Consideration should also 
be given to statistical interpretation of acute exposures. 
Because derivation of non-human biota dose benchmarks for generic use is still ongoing, the applicant 
should reference and describe alternative interpretations of radiation risk. A documented detailed 
description would be appropriate only if more restrictive criteria could lead to a conclusion of likely and 
significant adverse effects. 
For more information on suitable approaches and their relationships to environmental protection goals, 
see: 
• 
Using an Ecosystem Approach to complement protection schemes based on organism-level endpoints, 
Journal of Environmental Radioactivity [99] 
• 
ICRP 108, Environmental Protection – the Concept and Use of Reference Animals and Plants [100] 
G.8.3 
Uncertainties 
Guidance 
The applicant should address the effects of using radiation weighting factors suggested in CSA N288.6, 
Environmental risk assessments at class I nuclear facilities and uranium mines and mills [7] for 
calculating a “biota effective dose” from absorbed dose (for example, weighting factors of 40 for alpha 
particles, and 3 for tritium beta particles). 
Chronic exposures that are less than a “biota effective dose” screening criterion of 10 µGy/h only need 
minimal interpretation or discussion. 
A deterministic modelling approach is acceptable, providing that model structure and parameters are 
documented, reasonably conservative, and whenever possible, supported by site-specific data. 
Some examples of conservative choices are: 
• 
selection of high transfer factor and diet exposure scenarios 
• 
use of dose coefficients that assume all energy is absorbed regardless of body size and geometry 
• 
setting radionuclide concentrations in some non-human biota equal to surrounding media and/or food 
items 
• 
assuming secular equilibrium for the presence of radioactive daughters, not adjusting for 
bioavailability for sediment/soil ingestion 
• 
calculating maximum possible doses to critical and sensitive organs (for example, bone marrow) 
relative to average whole-body doses 
The applicant should use a probabilistic modelling approach if there is ambiguity in the validity of dose 
estimates for site-specific conditions and/or VCs. For example, a probabilistic approach is appropriate 
when it is necessary to grossly extrapolate information for other areas or species, or when there is 
ambiguity in the protection of any threatened or endangered species, or species of concern.
