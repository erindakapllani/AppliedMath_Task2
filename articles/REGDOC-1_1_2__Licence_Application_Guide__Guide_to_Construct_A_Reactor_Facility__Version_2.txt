Preface 
This regulatory document is part of the CNSC’s reactor facilities series of regulatory documents, which 
also covers site suitability and licence application guides for other lifecycle stages of reactor facilities. 
The full list of regulatory document series is included at the end of this document and can also be found 
on the CNSC’s website. 
Regulatory document REGDOC-1.1.2, Licence Application Guide: Licence to Construct a Reactor 
Facility, clarifies the requirements for and provides guidance on submitting an application to the CNSC to 
obtain a licence to construct a reactor facility in Canada, and identifies the information that should be 
included in the application. 
This document is the second version, and supersedes REGDOC-1.1.2, Licence Application Guide: 
Licence to Construct a Nuclear Power Plant, published in August 2019. It will be used to assess licence 
applications for proposed new reactor facilities. Once the Commission has granted a licence, the safety 
and control measures described in the licence application and the documents needed to support the 
application will form part of the licensing basis. 
The licence application and the documents needed to support it, including the documents the application 
references, become the safety case for the reactor facility.  
The information required for the future operating licence application will be added to the construction 
safety case. The safety case will then be kept up to date over the reactor facility’s lifecycle to reflect its 
current state and condition. 
Given the wide range of reactor facilities – especially of advanced and small modular reactors – and given 
that reactor facilities have risk profiles that vary significantly depending on the particular characteristics 
of the activity or facility, the applicant or licensee can apply a risk-informed approach that includes 
grading and alternatives in the development of the application, in accordance with REGDOC-1.1.5, 
Supplemental Information for Small Modular Reactor Proponents, and REGDOC-3.5.3, Regulatory 
Fundamentals. 
For information on the implementation of regulatory documents and on the graded approach, see 
REGDOC-3.5.3, Regulatory Fundamentals. 
The words “shall” and “must” are used to express requirements to be satisfied by the licensee or 
licence applicant. “Should” is used to express guidance or that which is advised. “May” is used to 
express an option or that which is advised or permissible within the limits of this regulatory document. 
“Can” is used to express possibility or capability. 
Nothing contained in this document is to be construed as relieving any licensee from any other 
pertinent requirements. It is the licensee’s responsibility to identify and comply with all applicable 
regulations and licence conditions.

Licence Application Guide: Licence to Construct a Reactor Facility 
1. 
Introduction 
1.1 
Purpose 
This licence application guide clarifies the requirements for and provides guidance on applying to 
the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC) for a licence to construct a reactor facility. 
Following the information in this regulatory document will prepare applicants to submit the 
appropriate information to demonstrate that they are qualified and will make adequate provision 
for the protection of the environment, the health and safety of persons and the maintenance of 
national security and measures required to implement international obligations to which Canada 
has agreed. 
1.2 
Scope 
This document will be used by applicants to prepare an application for a licence to construct a 
proposed new reactor facility at a new or existing site. 
Given the wide range of reactor facilities – especially of advanced and small modular reactors 
(SMRs) – and given that reactor facilities have risk profiles that vary significantly, the applicant 
or licensee can apply a risk-informed approach that includes grading and alternatives in the 
development of the application, in accordance with REGDOC-1.1.5, Supplemental Information 
for Small Modular Reactor Proponents [1], and REGDOC-3.5.3, Regulatory Fundamentals [2]. 
The information provided in this document does not prevent applicants from proposing 
alternative ways to meet a requirement. Any proposed alternative (including the use of other 
codes and standards) should appropriately address the complexities and hazards of the proposed 
activities, and the applicant must demonstrate, by providing supporting information, that the 
proposed alternative meets an equivalent or superior level of safety. 
This application guide covers the initial application for construction of a reactor facility. 
1.3 
Relevant legislation 
Appendix A maps a list of relevant sections from the Nuclear Safety and Control Act (NSCA) and 
the regulations made under the NSCA to the related sections of this licence application guide. 
1.4 
CNSC contact information 
A single point of contact from the CNSC is assigned to work with every licensee or applicant. 
This point of contact can provide the licensee or applicant with additional information or 
explanation of the information contained within this document. 
The applicant should contact the CNSC before submitting the licence application and request the 
name and contact information of the single point of contact assigned to the licence application. 
For additional information, see section 2.3, Structuring the licence application. 
To contact the CNSC, refer to the CNSC’s website.

2. 
Licensing Basis, Process and Submission 
This section provides information on the licensing basis and application process, including 
completing and submitting the licence application. 
The licence application, and the documents needed to support it, form the reference safety case 
for the reactor facility and thus would form part of the licensing basis. Hence, applicants should 
be aware that this information needs to be controlled in the same manner as other parts of the 
licensing basis and could be subject to CNSC compliance verification. Further information on the 
licensing basis is provided in REGDOC-3.5.3, Regulatory Fundamentals [2].  
The construction safety case includes requirements for preparing the site, designing and 
constructing the facility, and fuel-out commissioning. 
Applicants should consider that the safety case for the facility will need to be updated as part of 
an application for a licence to operate. 
2.1 
Background 
Under the Class I Nuclear Facilities Regulations, the following activities may be licensed: 
 
site preparation for the purpose of constructing or operating a reactor facility 
 
construction of a reactor facility 
 
operation of a reactor facility 
 
decommissioning of a reactor facility 
 
abandonment of a reactor facility 
In most cases, policies, programs, processes, procedures and other safety and control measures 
developed at the lifecycle phase of site preparation will continue to be used and adapted to 
support the construction and commissioning activities encompassed by the licence. 
Note 1: Licences can be combined to permit multiple activities. For more information on 
combined licence applications, see section 2.4. 
Note 2: This document applies to various technologies, including those having novelties, such as 
a liquid fuel. The phrase “to the extent practicable” is used within this document, recognizing that 
not all requirements are applicable to all technologies in their current state. In addition, for a first-
of-a-kind design, information may not be available or verifiable until the facility has been 
constructed and/or operated. Where the phrase “to the extent practicable” is used, a conservative 
engineering approach is expected to be demonstrated. 
2.2 
Licensing process 
REGDOC-3.5.1, Licensing Process for Class I Nuclear Facilities and Uranium Mines and 
Mills [3], clarifies the licensing process in the context of the NSCA.  
The licensing process is initiated when the applicant submits a licence application. Applicants 
should ensure that they have included sufficiently detailed information to allow the licensing 
process to proceed efficiently. In addition to the information provided in this licence application 
guide, the CNSC may request additional information by sending supplemental, facility-specific 
guidance to the applicant prior to the beginning of, or during, the licensing process.

Early engagement with CNSC staff (before submission of the application) is possible and 
encouraged. For example: 
 
the applicant may submit a letter to notify the CNSC of the forthcoming application and 
provide some information on the scope and schedule of the proposed project 
 
the vendor may request a pre-licensing vendor design review, an optional service provided by 
the CNSC (when requested by a vendor) that enables CNSC staff to provide feedback early in 
the design process based on a vendor’s reactor technology; for more information, see 
REGDOC-1.1.5, Supplemental Information for Small Modular Reactor Proponents [1] 
Note: The information provided in this document does not prevent applicants from proposing 
alternative ways to meet a requirement. However, any proposed alternative (including the use of 
codes and standards other than those referenced in this licence application guide) should 
appropriately address the complexities and hazards of the proposed activities, and the applicant 
must demonstrate (through supporting information and a code comparison) that the proposed 
alternative provides an equivalent or superior level of safety to Canadian standards. 
2.3 
Structuring the licence application 
The application may be completed in either of Canada's official languages (English or French). 
This licence application guide describes the expected safety and control measures, organized 
according to the CNSC's safety and control area (SCA) framework. The CNSC uses SCAs as the 
technical topics to assess, review, verify and report on regulatory requirements and performance 
across all regulated facilities and activities, as follows (see appendix B): 
 
management system 
 
human performance management 
 
operating performance 
 
safety analysis 
 
physical design 
 
fitness for service 
 
radiation protection 
 
conventional health and safety 
 
environmental protection 
 
emergency management and fire protection 
 
waste management 
 
security 
 
safeguards and non-proliferation 
 
packaging and transport 
Each of the 14 SCAs is further divided into specific areas, as appropriate, that cover topics 
addressed in a complete assessment and review. This guide identifies the specific areas relevant 
to an initial application for a licence to construct, recognizing that CNSC staff may identify 
additional areas during the application review. 
The applicant may choose to organize the information in any structure. However, the applicant is 
encouraged to organize the licence application according to the CNSC's SCA framework so as to 
facilitate the CNSC's review. If the application does not follow the order and organization of 
October 2022 
REGDOC-1.1.2, Licence Application Guide: Licence to Construct a Reactor Facility 
 
4 
 
SCAs as shown above, the applicant should map the application to the CNSC's SCA framework. 
References to more detailed supporting documentation may be included in the application.  
2.4 
Completing the licence application 
The applicant is responsible for ensuring that the licence application contains sufficient 
information to demonstrate that:  
 
all regulatory requirements are met 
 
the applicant is qualified to carry on the licensed activity and will make adequate provision to 
protect the health, safety and security of persons and the environment 
 
The applicant may provide cross-references to other detailed sources, as appropriate. 
The application should cite the CNSC regulatory documents and the codes and standards that the 
applicant intends to apply and implement (these may form part of the licensing basis). The 
regulatory documents and the codes and standards support the applicant's ability to implement the 
safety and control measures.  
Applicants are encouraged to discuss with the CNSC the appropriate version (publication date 
and revision number) of each document (regulatory document, code or standard) planned to be 
applied. CNSC staff may also provide supplemental guidance on additional documents that the 
applicant should consider and address in the application. This pre-licensing communication is in 
alignment with REGDOC-3.5.1, Licensing Process for Class I Nuclear Facilities and Uranium 
Mines and Mills [3]. 
An application for a licence to construct a reactor facility should provide a list of the application’s 
supporting documents and clearly identify which information has already been submitted to the 
CNSC. Appendix D provides a sample format for applicants to map their supporting documents 
to the SCA framework.  
Note: If the document version in the supporting information has changed since the previous 
submission, the applicant must provide the CNSC with the new version number, a copy of the 
new version, and a summary of major changes between the new version and the version 
previously reviewed by CNSC staff. Appendix E provides a sample format for listing revisions to 
the supporting documentation. 
Where a subset of the material within a supporting document addresses regulatory requirements, 
the relevant sections should be clearly identified.  
Combined licence applications 
The applicant may apply for a combined licence that permits multiple activities (for example, a 
combined licence to prepare the site and to construct the reactor facility). The applicant may 
propose any combination of activities, and CNSC staff will review each combined licence 
application against the applicable regulatory requirements. 
The applicant shall address all regulatory requirements pertaining to all stages (for example, 
construction and operation) covered by the combined licence application. 
Applicants are strongly encouraged to discuss a combined licence application strategy with the 
CNSC prior to submitting an application.

Submission of licence application documentation over a defined period of time 
The Commission will require a complete application, containing all information required under 
the NSCA and its regulations, as clarified through the regulatory framework, in order to make a 
decision on a licence to construct a reactor facility. 
Given the extent of information that is required in an application for a licence to construct a 
reactor facility, an applicant may provide supporting documentation over a defined period of 
time. When using this approach, the applicant should provide a detailed project schedule of 
submissions with the initial licence application. 
As described in REGDOC-3.5.1, Licensing Process for Class I Nuclear Facilities and Uranium 
Mines and Mills [3], a licence to construct enables a licensee to construct, commission and 
operate some components of the reactor facility (for example, security systems). Some specific 
commissioning activities may be allowed by the Commission through issuance of a licence to 
construct in order to demonstrate that the facility has been constructed in accordance with the 
approved design and that the systems important to safety are functioning as intended. The 
applicant must demonstrate that the proposed design of the facility conforms to regulatory 
requirements and is capable of operating safely on the designated site over its proposed lifecycle.

Safety analysis 
The safety analysis SCA covers maintenance of the safety analysis that supports the overall safety 
case for the facility. Safety analysis is a systematic evaluation of the potential hazards associated 
with the conduct of a proposed activity or facility and considers the effectiveness of preventive 
measures and strategies in reducing the effects of such hazards. 
A cross-reference linking legislative clauses to applicable sections of this guide is provided in 
appendix A. 
4.4.1 
General considerations 
The application shall include a preliminary safety analysis report (PSAR) for the reactor facility. 
The PSAR should include a deterministic safety analysis, a probabilistic safety assessment (PSA) 
and a hazards analysis commensurate with the level of design. The PSAR should be developed 
commensurate with the level of design (for additional information, see section 4.5.1, Description 
of structures, systems and components). The application should demonstrate that all levels of 
defence in depth are addressed, and should confirm that the facility's design is capable of meeting 
the applicable dose acceptance criteria and safety goals. 
The application should demonstrate that, whenever operator action is considered, the operators 
will have reliable information, sufficient time to perform the required actions and documented 
procedures to follow, and will have been trained. 
Safety analysis is an iterative process. The safety analyses included in the PSAR should proceed 
in parallel with the design process, with iteration taking place between the 2 activities. With each 
iteration, the applicant should provide a higher level of detail. The applicant should outline the 
methodology used to advance the detailed design and the safety analyses. The scope and level of 
detail of the analyses should increase as the design is developed. The application should 
demonstrate that the design, procurement, manufacture, equipment qualification, construction, 
installation and commissioning processes are taken into account in the safety analyses to ensure 
that the design intent will be achieved in the “as built” reactor facility. 
The application should describe the programs and oversight that are in place to ensure that the 
safety analysis is carried out by technically qualified and appropriately trained staff. The 
programs, oversight and results should demonstrate alignment with the management system 
program and be in accordance with “informed customer” principles. The information should 
demonstrate that all contractors and subcontractors involved in the safety analysis are qualified to 
carry out their respective activities. 
4.4.2

for human-induced external hazards: those that are identified in the site evaluation, such as 
airplane crashes and ship collisions 
 
for internal hazards: internal fires, internal floods, turbine missiles, onsite transportation 
accidents, and releases of hazardous substances from onsite storage facilities

should describe, explain and justify the approach taken. 
Severe accidents, for those not addressed as DBAs, are typically sequences involving more than 
one failure (such as reactor facility blackout or design-basis events with degraded performance of 
a safety system). The application should describe how the analysis: 
 
uses best-estimate models and assumptions 
 
takes credit for realistic system action and performance beyond original intended functions, 
including systems not important to safety 
 
takes credit for realistic operator actions 
Where this is not possible, reasonably conservative assumptions should be made. These 
assumptions should consider uncertainties in the understanding of the physical processes being 
modelled. 
Where applicable, the application should include an explanation of the analysis performed for 
severe accident sequences and a description of the results used in developing the accident 
management programs and emergency preparedness planning for the reactor facility.

Appendix C: Review Objectives for an Application for a Licence to Construct a 
Reactor Facility 
When establishing the scope of the review for an application to construct a reactor facility, CNSC staff 
consider 3 levels of objectives. These objectives are developed to assist in integrating individual reviews 
into an overall assessment of the adequacy of a licence application. 
C.1 
First-level objectives 
The first-level objectives are described in subsection 24(4) of the Nuclear Safety and Control Act 
(NSCA). In addition, the facility design and operation need to address the mitigation measures identified 
in the environmental review. 
C.2 
Second-level objectives 
The second-level objectives are: 
S 
Design safety objective: The design of a reactor facility to be constructed should make 
adequate provisions (not pose an unreasonable risk) for the protection of the environment, the 
health and safety of persons and the maintenance of national security and measures required 
to implement international obligations to which Canada has agreed. 
C 
Construction program objective: Adequate provisions should be made for the construction 
of the reactor facility to be carried on in a safe manner and with sufficient quality. 
Q 
Qualifications objective: The applicant, and all entities involved in the design, construction 
and commissioning of the reactor facility, should be qualified to carry on the licensed 
activity. The program and schedule for recruiting, training, qualifying and certifying workers 
in respect of the operation and maintenance of the reactor facility should be adequate. 
The design safety objective captures a large portion of the general nuclear safety objective, as established 
by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and as explicitly stated in REGDOC-2.5.2, Design of 
Reactor Facilities [17], which requires that reactor facilities “be designed and operated in a manner that 
will protect individuals, society and the environment from harm”. 
The construction program objective expresses the high-level expectations for the construction program. 
The qualifications objective expresses the high-level expectation that adequately qualified persons will 
carry out the design, construction and commissioning of the reactor facility. It also addresses the 
requirements of the Class I Nuclear Facilities Regulations related to training, qualification and 
certification of workers. 
C.3 
Third-level objectives 
Meeting the design safety objective means satisfying the relevant expectations outlined in: 
 
REGDOC-2.5.2, Design of Reactor Facilities [17] 
 
REGDOC-2.4.1, Deterministic Safety Analysis [16] 
Each of the second-level objectives can be subdivided into third-level objectives, which have more 
specific means of assessment. In reviewing an application for a licence to construct a reactor facility, 
CNSC staff assess whether the objectives are met for the applicable topical areas. 
October 2022 
REGDOC-1.1.2, Licence Application Guide: Licence to Construct a Reactor Facility 
 
77 
 
Third-level objectives related to the design safety objective are: 
SO1 
The design captures all of the mitigation measures identified during the environmental review 
and ensures that operating performance meets all regulatory requirements concerning the 
nuclear and hazardous releases. 
SO2 
The design follows the ALARA principle. 
SO3 
The design complies with the dose acceptance criteria and safety goals. 
SO4 
The design complies with the defence-in-depth principle. 
SO5 
The fundamental safety functions perform adequately in the design. 
SO6 
The design provides adequate means to mitigate and manage accidents. 
SO7 
Adequate design provisions have been made for security and design robustness. 
SO8 
The management system of programs, policies and procedures fosters a healthy safety culture 
and it is adequate for the design, construction and commissioning of the reactor facility. 
SO9 
The management system of programs, policies and procedures fosters a healthy safety culture 
and it is adequate for the future operation and decommissioning of the reactor facility. 
SO10 Adequate design, infrastructure and programmatic provisions are made in the area of 
safeguards. 
Third-level objectives related to the construction program objective are: 
CO1 
Adequate assurance that all activities involving construction/erection of structures and 
systems and fabrication/erection of components are carried out by qualified personnel. 
CO2
