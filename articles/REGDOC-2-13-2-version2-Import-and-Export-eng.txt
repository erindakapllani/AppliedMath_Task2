Draft 
Preface 
This regulatory document is part of the CNSC's safeguards and non-proliferation series of regulatory 
documents, which also covers regulatory controls on import and export of prescribed items. The full list 
of the CNSC’s series of regulatory document series is included at the end of this document and can also 
be found on the CNSC’s Web site. 
Part I of regulatory document REGDOC-2.13.2, Import and Export, sets out the CNSC’s guidance for 
current and prospective licensees who intend to import or export nuclear and nuclear-related dual-use 
items, also known as controlled nuclear substances, equipment and information. The latter are identified 
in the schedule to the Nuclear Non-proliferation Import and Export Control Regulations (NNIECR). The 
legislation relevant to the import and export of these items is provided, along with an overview of the 
domestic and international contexts that form the basis of import and export controls for these items. The 
licensing program is outlined and information is provided on how to apply for a licence and amend an 
existing licence, and on application processing times.   
Part II of regulatory document REGDOC-2.13.2, Import and Export, sets out the CNSC’s guidance for 
current and prospective licensees who intend to import or export risk-significant radioactive sources 
(Category 1 and 2 radioactive sources). This guidance supersedes INFO-0791 – Control of the Export and 
Import of Risk-Significant Radioactive Sources. 
 
This document examines the type of information the CNSC considers when assessing applications for the 
import or export of controlled nuclear substances, equipment and information. Further information is also 
provided for exporters on the end-use control, which allows the CNSC to require exporters to apply for a 
licence for items that are not otherwise listed in the schedule to the NNIECR when they may be intended 
for use in connection with a nuclear weapons program. Finally, the CNSC’s activities to verify and 
enforce regulatory compliance are considered. 
 
Requirements associated with this document are found in the Nuclear Safety and Control Act (NSCA), 
the General Nuclear Safety and Control Regulations (GNSCR) and the NNIECR. 
 
Important note: Where referenced in a licence either directly or indirectly (such as through licensee-
referenced documents), this document is part of the licensing basis for a regulated facility or activity.  
The licensing basis sets the boundary conditions for acceptable performance at a regulated facility or 
activity, and establishes the basis for the CNSC’s compliance program for that regulated facility or 
activity.  
Where this document is part of the licensing basis, the word “shall” is used to express a requirement to 
be satisfied by the licensee or licence applicant. “Should” is used to express guidance or that which is 
advised. “May” is used to express an option or that which is advised or permissible within the limits of 
this regulatory document. “Can” is used to express possibility or capability. 
Nothing contained in this document is to be construed as relieving any licensee from any other 
pertinent requirements. It is the licensee’s responsibility to identify and comply with all applicable 
regulations and licence conditions.

Part I:  Nuclear and Nuclear-Related Dual-Use Items 
4. 
Program Framework 
4.1 
Overview 
This section outlines the basis for import and export controls implemented by the CNSC for 
controlled nuclear substances, equipment and information. 
Canada controls the import and export of a number of goods for various reasons, including 
regulation of trade in strategic and military goods, prevention of proliferation of weapons of mass 
destruction, and fulfillment of international obligations. One of the main objectives of controlling 
the transfer of sensitive nuclear-related items is to prevent illicit transfers to a nuclear weapons 
program while facilitating legitimate commerce.  
Effective import and export controls are based on an interrelated set of domestic and international 
laws, regulations, agreements and best practices. The domestic context is comprised of national 
legislation and Canadian nuclear non-proliferation policy, while the international context is 
influenced by the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and multilateral export 
control regimes.  
Sections 4.2 and 4.3 of this document provide further information on the domestic and 
international aspects of the CNSC’s import and export controls. 
4.2 
The domestic context 
Legislation: the Nuclear Safety and Control Act and the Nuclear Non-proliferation Import and 
Export Control Regulations 
The CNSC regulates the use of nuclear energy and materials to protect the health, safety and 
security of Canadians as well as the environment, and to implement measures to which Canada 
has agreed respecting international control of the development, production and use of nuclear 
energy, including the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear explosive devices.  
Pursuant to the NSCA, the CNSC licenses, regulates and establishes technical requirements for 
all nuclear-related activities in Canada.   
The schedule to the NNIECR lists controlled nuclear substances, equipment and information. The 
Schedule is comprised of two parts: Part A lists nuclear items and Part B lists nuclear-related 
dual-use items. For this reason, controlled nuclear substances, equipment and information are also 
referred to as nuclear and nuclear-related dual-use items. 
The items listed in Part A are those especially designed or prepared for nuclear use. Examples 
include: 
• 
nuclear material (uranium, plutonium, thorium) 
• 
nuclear reactors and equipment 
• 
non-nuclear material used in reactors (heavy water, deuterium, graphite) 
• 
plants and equipment for conversion, enrichment and reprocessing of nuclear material and for 
fuel fabrication and heavy water production 
April 2018 
 
REGDOC-2.13.2, Import and Export, version 2

• 
technology associated with any of the foregoing items 
The items listed in Part B are those that have legitimate non-nuclear applications, but that could 
also make a significant contribution to an unsafeguarded nuclear fuel cycle or nuclear explosive 
activity. Examples include: 
• 
nickel powder and lithium 
• 
machine tools 
• 
implosion systems development equipment 
• 
high explosives and related equipment 
• 
technology associated with any of the aforementioned items 
Canada’s nuclear non-proliferation policy 
Canada was the first country with substantial nuclear capability to reject the development and 
acquisition of nuclear weapons, and has been actively involved in the international promotion of 
the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. The two objectives of Canada’s nuclear non-proliferation 
policy are to: 
• 
assure Canadians and the international community that Canada’s nuclear exports do not 
contribute to the development of nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices 
• 
promote a more effective and comprehensive international nuclear non-proliferation regime 
The policy provides that Canadian-supplied nuclear material, equipment, non-nuclear material 
and technology may only be transferred to countries with which Canada has concluded a bilateral 
nuclear cooperation agreement (NCA). 
The CNSC – along with its predecessor, the Atomic Energy Control Board – has contributed to 
fulfilling Canada’s international obligations and commitments on the peaceful uses of nuclear 
energy since 1946. Accordingly, the CNSC has substantive involvement in implementing key 
aspects of Canada’s nuclear non-proliferation policy. This includes making sure that major 
nuclear exports are made subject to a NCA. NCAs, which are treaty-level documents negotiated 
by Global Affairs Canada, establish reciprocal obligations (between Canada and the partner 
country) that are designed to minimize the risk of proliferation associated with the international 
transfer of major nuclear items. The CNSC implements the terms and conditions of these 
agreements through the administrative arrangements (AAs) that it concludes with its counterpart 
in the partner country. 
Key provisions contained in Canada’s NCAs include: peaceful, non-explosive end-use 
assurances; control over retransfer to third parties of Canadian-obligated items; control over 
reprocessing of Canadian-obligated uranium; control over the high enrichment of Canadian-
obligated uranium; provisions for fall-back safeguards; and adequate physical protection of 
Canadian-obligated items. 
Some licensing applications for the import and export of controlled nuclear substances, 
equipment and information may invoke the implementation of provisions of bilateral NCAs and 
AAs by the CNSC as part of the licensing assessment and decision process. Section 6.2 of this 
document provides information on this process.

Foreign-origin uranium 
Canadian exports of uranium for nuclear use include not only Canadian-origin uranium, but also 
foreign-origin uranium imported into Canada for commercial processing before delivery to 
another country. In those instances where foreign-origin uranium imported to Canada for 
commercial processing does not carry a foreign obligation, this uranium will be made subject to 
the terms and conditions of an NCA between Canada and the recipient country at the time of 
export. 
4.3 
The international context  
Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons 
The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) is the cornerstone of the 
international nuclear non-proliferation regime. Signatories to the NPT commit to prevent the 
spread of nuclear weapons, promote cooperation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy, and 
achieve nuclear disarmament.   
Through the NSCA and corresponding regulations, the CNSC implements the following 
commitments that Canada, as a signatory to the NPT, has agreed to: 
• 
not to receive, manufacture or acquire nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices 
• 
to accept IAEA safeguards on all nuclear material in Canada 
• 
to ensure that Canada’s nuclear exports to non-nuclear-weapons states are subject to IAEA 
safeguards 
Multilateral export control groups 
Multilateral export control groups are another important element of the international nuclear non-
proliferation regime. Canada is a member of the Zangger Committee and the Nuclear Suppliers 
Group (NSG), which are export control regimes that help ensure that nuclear and nuclear-related 
dual-use items are only used for peaceful purposes. States that are members of these regimes 
agree by consensus on lists of items whose transfer must be controlled. Implementation of these 
controls is done in accordance with domestic export control laws and practices, including national 
export licensing requirements.  The schedule to the NNIECR is based on the lists of items agreed 
by the Zangger Committee and NSG. 
5. 
Licensing Process 
5.1 
Overview 
The import and export of the controlled items in the NNIECR require a licence from the CNSC, 
except for activities exempted under subsection 4(1) of the NNIECR.  
The CNSC has established a risk-based licensing program for these imports and exports. This 
program ensures that imports and exports of nuclear and nuclear-related dual-use items conform 
to domestic regulatory requirements, Canadian nuclear non-proliferation policy and Canada’s 
international obligations.   
For Canadian nuclear facilities, the Commission makes most licensing decisions on the basis of 
the technical support and recommendations of CNSC staff. For import and export licensing,

however, the Commission has delegated this authority pursuant to subsection 37(1) of the NSCA 
to a designated officer. It is the designated officer who makes decisions to issue, amend, replace, 
renew, authorize the transfer of, suspend or revoke import and export licences.  
Revocation, amendment and replacement of an export licence or an import licence by a 
designated officer will be considered on the basis of an application submitted pursuant to 
requirements and information specified in section 6 of the GNSCR.  
5.2 
How to apply for a CNSC import or export licence 
The CNSC has developed application forms for import licences (Application for a Licence to 
Import Nuclear Items) and export licences (Application for a Licence to Export Nuclear and 
Nuclear-Related Dual-Use Items). Appendix C of this document provides detailed information on 
completing these forms, and also includes copies of them for reference. 
The information required in support of a CNSC import or export application can be found in 
subsection 3(1) of the NNIECR. Completed import and export licence applications should be 
submitted to the CNSC’s Licensing Administrator (Nuclear), via mail, fax or email: 
Licensing Administrator (Nuclear)

Email: cnsc.export-import.ccsn@canada.ca 
5.3 
What import and export licences authorize 
A CNSC import or export licence authorizes a licensee (the person or organization to whom the 
licence has been issued) to carry out the import or export activity defined in the licence. A licence 
is transaction-specific and identifies the item, quantity, end-use, end-user and consignee. It may 
authorize the transfer of a defined quantity of items in single or multiple shipments, depending 
upon the commercial arrangement; however, the quantity authorized cannot be exceeded and all 
shipments must take place within the defined duration of the licence. 
A licence may also authorize shipments to single or multiple consignees in a given country. The 
licence is generally valid for one year, but an applicant may request a longer licence period to 
accommodate a commercial contract.   
Some licences contain compliance conditions that are related to reporting requirements, such as 
shipment notifications or annual summaries of shipments. Section 8 of this document provides 
information on compliance with licence conditions that may be included in CNSC import and 
export licences. 
5.4 
Licence amendments and transfers 
A CNSC import or export licence may be amended to:  
• 
change the expiry date

• 
add or remove consignees  
• 
add or remove items authorized for import or export 
• 
change the sender or recipient address  
• 
change the quantity of items on the existing licence  
• 
modify the end-use  
To request a licence amendment, use the application forms referenced in section 5.2 of this 
document. Select the “Amendment – Licence number” box and identify the number of the 
existing licence in question. When applying for amendment(s), only complete the relevant 
section(s) of the application form.   
Please note: A licence cannot be amended once the authorized quantity has been imported or 
exported. Similarly, an amendment cannot be made after a licence has expired. Therefore, 
applications to amend licences should be received by the CNSC at least 15 business days before 
the amended licence is required. 
The transfer of a CNSC import or export licence from an existing licensee (the transferor) to 
another entity (the transferee) may be authorized by the CNSC upon consideration of an 
application submitted by both entities. Licence transfers may be authorized where a change of 
legal status has occurred and it can be verified that the new licensee (the transferee) is capable of 
ensuring compliance with the NSCA, relevant regulations and all licence conditions. If significant 
changes to the terms and conditions are also proposed, a transfer will not be authorized and the 
applicant for the licence will need to apply for issuance of a new licence. Further information can 
be obtained by contacting the CNSC’s Licensing Administrator (Nuclear).  
5.5 
Processing time and service standards 
Applicants can generally expect the CNSC to decide upon the issuance of an import or export 
licence within 15 business days of receiving a complete application. Incomplete applications 
cannot be processed, and additional information will be required before the assessment can 
proceed. 
While the CNSC strives to process all applications within 15 business days, delays may be 
incurred for export licence applications that require international communications and/or 
consultations. For example, exports of items in Part A of the schedule to the NNIECR may be 
subject to bilateral NCAs. In such cases, the CNSC must first ensure that appropriate notifications 
are exchanged with a partner country before an export can be authorized. Depending upon the 
country, it may take up to 30 business days to ensure the appropriate conditions are in place for 
the transfer. In such cases, the CNSC will keep the applicant apprised of the expected timeline to 
complete the assessment. Applicants are always encouraged to apply for an export licence at the 
earliest opportunity.  
The CNSC website provides more information on service standards for import and export 
licences.  
5.6 
Non-CNSC export requirements 
Along with the export authorization required from the CNSC for nuclear and nuclear-related 
dual-use items, the export of these items may also be controlled by Global Affairs Canada 
pursuant to the Export and Import Permits Act and its corresponding Export Control List. 
Exporters can obtain further information on these licensing requirements by contacting:

Evaluation of Licence Applications  
6.1 
Receipt of application 
Upon receipt of an import and export licence application, the CNSC sends an email of 
acknowledgement to the applicant. This acknowledgement message assigns a reference number to 
the application, which both the applicant and the CNSC should use in any future correspondence.  
The CNSC screens the application to ensure that all information described in section 3 of the 
NNIECR has been submitted by the applicant. If any information is missing, the CNSC will ask 
the applicant to submit it. For applications concerning a controlled nuclear substance, the CNSC 
will also consider if the applicant requires a licence to possess or use the substance.  
Note: This initial screening does not consider the quality of an application or its technical aspects.   
6.2 
Assessment of application 
The CNSC assesses the licence application based on a number of risk factors. If the CNSC 
requires additional information at this point, it will ask for it from the applicant. Additional 
information requested may be related to quantity, technical specifications of the item(s) or more 
information about the end-use or end-user. The CNSC will resume processing the application 
when it receives the requested information from the applicant. 
When assessing an application, the CNSC considers a range of information, such as:  
• 
the non-proliferation credentials of the importing country (whether it is a member of the NPT 
and/or NSG) 
• 
information available with regard to nuclear weapons-related activities in the end-user 
country or an intermediary country (if any) 
• 
the applicability of bilateral NCAs 
• 
relevance of the items in question to any known procurement efforts 
• 
risk of diversion posed by the transfer  
• 
utility of the item(s) to a nuclear weapon or nuclear explosive device  
• 
any proliferation concerns regarding any parties to the transaction 
• 
whether the end-use and end-user are legitimate  
• 
previous denials to a certain end-user  
• 
the types of assurances or guarantees provided and/or required 
April 2018 
 
REGDOC-2.13.2, Import and Export, version 2 
 
10 
 
The CNSC will assess the overall proliferation risk, taking into account all of the above factors, 
for each application. Examples of some of the specific areas that are assessed are considered 
below.   
Whether the item is controlled by the Nuclear Non-proliferation Import and Export Control 
Regulations  
The CNSC will review the description of the item to determine if the item is controlled under the 
NNIECR. If it is deemed that the item is not controlled, the applicant will be informed in writing 
(by email or letter) of this decision. If, on the basis of the information already provided in the 
application, the control status is unclear, the CNSC will request further information from the 
applicant as per subsection 3(2) of the NNIECR. 
Intangible technology transfers 
Export controls also apply to intangible transfers of controlled nuclear information; for example, 
in the case of controlled nuclear information (see paragraphs A.4 and B.3 in the schedule to the 
NNIECR). Examples of intangible transfers include:  
• 
emails  
• 
face-to-face meetings  
• 
telephone conversations  
• 
provision of services or training  
• 
publishing in international journals or exchanging information in international forums   
• 
downloads or other electronic file exchanges   
Intangible transfers still require export authorization.  
This includes the transfer of controlled nuclear information to and from a cloud service provider 
when those servers are located outside of Canada.   
If uncertain as to whether an import or export licence is required, there is no cost associated with 
submitting an application for assessment.  Alternatively, applicants are encouraged to contact the 
CNSC at cnsc.export-import.ccsn@canada.ca.  
Whether the item is subject to a nuclear cooperation agreement 
If the item is controlled and found to be subject to an NCA, the appropriate bilateral notifications 
must be exchanged with the country that will import the item. Depending upon the partner 
country, this step usually takes from one to six weeks. In general, items found in Part A of The 
schedule to the NNIECR are subject to an NCA. 
Country of origin of the item 
Applicants are to identify the origin of the item in the application, so the CNSC can determine 
what bilateral commitments, if any, are associated with the item.   
End-use and end-user 
With export applications in particular, a large part of the CNSC’s assessment focuses on whether 
the end-use and end-user are legitimate, as well as whether the transfer poses a proliferation risk.   
April 2018 
 
REGDOC-2.13.2, Import and Export, version 2 
 
11 
 
If the item is not subject to an NCA, the recipient country is not bound by the same level of 
obligations that help to minimize the proliferation risk associated with the international transfer of 
major nuclear items.  
In the case of nuclear-related dual-use items (see Part B of The schedule to the NNIECR), it is 
also necessary to determine if end-use assurances are required.   
Open-source information may be used to assess the end-use and end-user, in order to ensure they 
are consistent with the items being transferred and that the transfer is solely for peaceful uses. In 
some cases, it may be necessary to obtain further assistance and information from other 
government departments. 
Other regulatory considerations 
Depending on the item, an application may be forwarded to other divisions within the CNSC for 
review. This ensures that other CNSC requirements related to safeguards, security (Nuclear 
Security Regulations), packaging and transport of nuclear substances (Packaging and Transport 
of Nuclear Substance Regulations), waste management, and possession controls are considered 
before import and export licences are issued. 
6.3 
Decision of the designated officer 
CNSC staff review the application and make a recommendation to the designated officer. The 
decision whether or not to issue the import or export licence is made by the designated officer in 
consideration of subsection 24(4) of the NSCA.  
If the designated officer is considering denying the application, the applicant will be informed of 
this via a formal letter. Under paragraph 39(1)(a) of the NSCA, the designated officer shall 
provide a reasonable opportunity to be heard to the applicant before refusing to issue a licence. 
As such, the letter identifies the opportunity for the applicant to submit any additional 
information that they believe the designated officer should consider. The letter also provides time 
limits for filing additional information with the designated officer and instructions for submitting 
the information. Rule 27 of the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission Rules of Procedure applies 
with respect to the opportunity to be heard. 
Should the designated officer refuse to issue a licence, the applicant can appeal the designated 
officer’s decision to the Commission. Subsection 43(1) of the NSCA and Rules 29 and 30 of the 
Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission Rules of Procedure apply with respect to a licence appeal. 
7. 
End-Use Controls for Nuclear-Related Dual-Use Items  
End-use controls, also known as “catch-all” controls, allow the CNSC to control items that are 
not otherwise specifically listed in the Schedule to the NNIECR when there are reasonable 
grounds to believe that such items may be intended for use in connection with a nuclear weapons 
program.  
These less-sensitive items do not meet the technical specifications of the items listed in Part B of  
the schedule to the NNIECR, but may still be of use in a nuclear weapons program. Examples 
include items used in the development and infrastructure of a nuclear weapons program, such as 
research and development programs at universities or unsafeguarded civilian nuclear reactors. As 
a result, such items may require a licence if there are reasonable grounds to suspect the item is 
April 2018 
 
REGDOC-2.13.2, Import and Export, version 2 
 
12 
 
intended for use in a nuclear weapons program. The end-use controls in  The schedule to the 
NNIECR apply to substances (paragraph B.1.1.20), equipment (paragraph B.2.7.6) and 
information (paragraph B.3).  
7.1 
Why end-use controls are necessary 
The items listed in the Schedule to the NNIECR are based on lists of nuclear and nuclear-related 
dual-use items agreed to by the NSG. The lists capture only the most proliferation-sensitive items, 
since the inclusion of all possible (less-sensitive) items that might support a nuclear weapons 
program would create an unnecessary burden on legitimate trade. End-use controls help the 
CNSC ensure that Canadian exporters do not contribute knowingly or unwittingly to a nuclear 
weapons program, by requiring less sensitive items to be made licensable if they are – or may be 
– for use in a nuclear weapons program. 
7.2 
When end-use controls are applied 
The CNSC determines if the end-use control is applicable upon receipt of an enquiry or 
application from the exporter, or if it determines that a shipment is being made to an end-user of 
concern. The latter determination may be accomplished through information received by the 
CNSC, or if the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) detains a shipment and consults with 
the CNSC as to whether an export licence is required.  
When the end-use control is applicable, the exporter will be informed by letter or email that an 
export licence is required before the item(s) may be exported. Once an export application is 
submitted, it will be assessed using the approach described in section 6 of this document. If the 
assessment concludes there is no risk of the item being used in, or diverted to, a nuclear weapons 
program, a licence will be issued. If CNSC staff recommend refusing the issuance of a licence, 
the aforementioned process for licence refusal will apply.  
7.3 
What exporters have to do  
If an export is subject to end-use controls, the exporter should contact the CNSC and apply for a 
licence. An export is likely to be controlled if it is known or suspected that it will be used in 
connection with the design, development, production, handling, operation, maintenance or 
storage of nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices. 
Exporters may often be unable to recognize, or may be unsure, if their products are intended for 
illicit purposes, e.g., in a nuclear weapons program. Appendix A therefore provides guidance to 
help exporters identify suspicious enquiries or orders that could require greater scrutiny. 
If exporters are uncertain whether end-use controls apply to an export, they may: 
• 
contact the CNSC at cnsc.export-import.ccsn@canada.ca to request further information 
• 
submit an export licence application 
8. 
Compliance With CNSC Requirements 
With respect to the import and export of controlled nuclear substances, equipment and 
information, individuals and companies are required to comply with the NSCA, its regulations, 
licences and their terms and conditions, as well as any orders made under the NSCA.   
April 2018 
 
REGDOC-2.13.2, Import and Export, version 2 
 
13 
 
8.1 
How the CNSC verifies compliance 
The CNSC conducts activities to verify and promote compliance, with the objective of assuring 
Canadians and the international community that international transfers of nuclear and 
nuclear-related dual-use items are used only for peaceful, non-explosive purposes. Audits of 
licence conditions and inspection activities are among the ways that the CNSC verifies 
compliance with import and export licences.   
Audits of licence conditions 
Subsection 24(5) of the NSCA allows licences to contain any term or condition that the CNSC 
considers necessary for meeting the purposes of the Act. Like other licences issued by the CNSC, 
import and export licences contain terms and conditions with which the licensee must comply. 
The conditions included within a licence depend on the nature of the item(s) being imported or 
exported and are generally related to: 
• 
prior or post shipment notifications 
• 
monthly or annual reporting  
• 
action to be taken with respect to the CBSA in relation to section 18 of the GNSCR 
The CNSC reviews the information provided by licensees to verify that the authorized quantity of 
the licence has not been exceeded and that, in the case of export licences, items are only being 
exported to authorized end-users. The CNSC also reviews the information provided as part of 
prior or post shipment notifications to verify that exports are being made in accordance with the 
terms and conditions of licences. 
Inspection activities  
The CNSC uses two general types of inspection activities to verify compliance with import and 
export licences: 
• 
The first is an audit of import/export-related documentation at licensees’ facilities. CNSC 
inspectors may review information such as shipping-related documentation, CBSA customs 
declarations and inventory control documents.   
• 
The second is an inspection of goods that have been detained at the border by the CBSA, in 
order to determine if they require a CNSC export licence.   
The documents required during CNSC audits of electronic transfers of controlled nuclear 
information will be case-dependent. A licensee is expected to have a clear understanding of when 
controlled nuclear information is being transferred, regardless of how it is transferred. For 
example, if the licensee is sending controlled nuclear information by email, that email should be 
associated with the requisite licence and should be easily identifiable to the licensee. This will 
allow for a record of the controlled nuclear information that has been transferred.  
Depending on the type of information being transferred, controlled nuclear information may or 
may not be associated with a formal inventory control system. Regardless of the system 
employed or the way in which controlled nuclear information is transferred, when controlled 
nuclear information is transferred it should be easily identifiable to the licensee and done in a 
manner in which records can be provided to the CNSC. The CNSC advises that documents be 
retained for a six year period.

8.2 
Disclosure of non-compliance 
The CNSC recognizes that responsible importers and exporters may, on occasion, inadvertently 
fail to obtain the appropriate import or export authorization from the CNSC, as required under the 
NSCA. Similarly, they may unintentionally fail to comply with a condition of an import or export 
licence. Importers and exporters in such a situation are encouraged to disclose any incidence of 
non-compliance to the CNSC as soon as possible. Appendix B sets out the recommended 
disclosure procedures to be followed in case of non-compliance. 
The CNSC looks favourably upon disclosures if, after considering the information provided 
(including the nature and seriousness of the disclosed violation or omission), it is satisfied that the 
importer or exporter has fully cooperated and taken appropriate measures to prevent future re-
occurrence of non-compliance. In such instances, no further action is generally warranted.  
If no disclosure is made, the CNSC may consider various options to address non-compliance, 
depending on the gravity of the incidence of non-compliance or on the overall circumstances. 
One such option is to issue an administrative monetary penalty, which is a monetary penalty 
imposed without court involvement for the violation of a regulatory requirement (see the CNSC’s 
website for more information). More serious cases may be referred to the CBSA or the RCMP for 
further review or investigation. 
8.3 
Best practices for responsible exporters 
Further information on best practices for responsible exporters can be found in a document 
published on the NSG website. Good Practices for Corporate Standards to Support the Efforts of 
the International Community in the Non-Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction offers 
suggestions that are not legally binding and that aim to boost commercial-sector support for non-
proliferation by reducing the risk of inadvertent supply of items to illicit procurement programs.  
Another example of best practices, focused on vendors, is the Nuclear Power Plant Exporters’ 
Principles of Conduct.

Part II: Risk-Significant Radioactive Sources 
9. 
Program Framework 
9.1 
Overview 
This section outlines the basis for import and export controls implemented by the CNSC for risk-
significant radioactive sources (Category 1 and 2 radioactive sources). 
The CNSC’s export and import control program for risk-significant radioactive sources includes 
consideration of Canada’s political commitment to adopt two key International Atomic Energy 
Agency (IAEA) documents: the Code of Conduct on the Safety and Security of Radioactive 
Sources (the Code) and the Guidance on the Import and Export of Radioactive Sources (the 
Guidance). Under the leadership of the IAEA, the Code and the Guidance were developed by the 
international community to augment the safety and security of radioactive sources. The 
Government of Canada has committed to implement the provisions contained within the Code, 
including implementing export and import controls consistent with the Code and Guidance. 
9.2 
The domestic context 
As Canada’s nuclear regulatory authority, the CNSC is responsible for controlling the export and 
import of risk-significant radioactive sources. Through its role in implementing export and import 
control measures, the CNSC enhances national and international safety and security by ensuring 
that only authorized persons are recipients of risk-significant radioactive sources. The CNSC’s 
program is consistent with the Code and Guidance, which have the following objectives: 
• 
achieving a high level of safety and security regarding risk-significant radioactive sources 
• 
reducing the likelihood of accidental harmful exposure to risk-significant radioactive sources 
or the malicious use of such sources to cause harm to individuals, society and the 
environment 
• 
mitigating or minimizing the radiological consequences of any accident or malicious act 
involving risk-significant radioactive sources 
9.3 
The international context 
Implementation of radioactive source export and import controls consistent with the Code and 
Guidance requires cooperation and consultation between regulatory authorities in the exporting 
and importing countries. The CNSC may enter into bilateral administrative arrangements with 
regulatory authorities in countries with which Canada has trade in risk-significant radioactive 
sources and with countries that share Canada’s commitments to effective international controls on 
transfers of radioactive sources. The objective of these arrangements is to establish harmonized 
bilateral procedures and communication channels for the efficient implementation of export and 
import controls, and thus to reduce the risk of undue delays in regulatory authorizations. 
10. 
Risk-Significant Radioactive Sources 
Risk-significant radioactive sources correspond to Category 1 and 2 radioactive sources of the 
IAEA’s categorization of radioactive sources (IAEA RS-G-1.9 – Categorization of Radioactive 
Sources). Table 1 lists the isotopes and threshold activities in Terabecquerels (TBq) for the 
Category 1 and Category 2 radioactive sources requiring export authorizations. Category 1 and 
April 2018 
 
REGDOC-2.13.2, Import and Export, version 2 
 
16 
 
Category 2 radioactive sources are defined as risk-significant radioactive sources for the purpose 
of the CNSC export and import control program.

Licensing and Control Process 
11.1 
Overview 
The CNSC export and import control program for risk-significant radioactive sources is designed 
to meet the provisions of the IAEA Code and the Guidance, in addition to the regulatory 
requirements under NSCA. Key elements of this regulatory program include: 
• 
a licensing and compliance process for the export of risk-significant radioactive sources 
• 
a control process for the import of risk-significant radioactive sources 
• 
implementation of bilateral administrative procedures with foreign regulatory authorities 
11.2 
Export licensing 
A CNSC licensee authorized to use or possess a risk-significant radioactive source must apply for 
and be issued an export licence before exporting that source. The licensee must ensure the 
information provided in an application is comprehensive enough to enable the CNSC to evaluate 
effectively the request for authorization to export. The CNSC assesses the information provided 
by the applicant to ensure that the proposed export meets national requirements and international 
obligations and commitments. For Category 1 radioactive source exports, the CNSC consults with 
the Importing State Authority prior to completing the assessment of an application. 
Export licences may contain any term or condition considered necessary for the purpose of the 
Nuclear Safety and Control Act, including requirements for providing prior and post shipment 
notifications of shipments. 
April 2018 
 
REGDOC-2.13.2, Import and Export, version 2 
 
17 
 
11.3 
Import controls 
The CNSC typically does not issue specific licences for the import of risk-significant radioactive 
sources. CNSC licensees that are authorized to possess risk-significant radioactive sources may 
import such sources consistent with the general import authorization for those sources that exists 
in their possession licences. 
The CNSC implements additional regulatory compliance controls on imports of risk-significant 
radioactive sources to ensure that bilateral responsibilities required under the Code and Guidance 
are met. These compliance controls include the review of prior import notifications received from 
foreign exporters, and decisions on requests received from foreign regulators (Exporting State 
Authority) for CNSC consent to the import of Category 1 radioactive sources. 
11.4 
How to apply for a CNSC export licence 
Applicants for an export licence must hold a licence issued by the CNSC to possess the risk-
significant radioactive sources in question. 
The CNSC has developed an application form for export licences (Application for a Licence to 
Export Risk-Significant Radioactive Sources). Appendix D of this document provides detailed 
information on completing the application form, and also includes a copy of the form for 
reference in Appendix D.1. 
Unless otherwise authorized by the CNSC: 
• 
a separate application is required for each export transaction or specific set of transactions 
that are anticipated to occur within a specific period of time 
• 
each export licence issued will authorize transfers to one or more recipients, but only to a 
single country 
• 
separate export licences will be issued for Category 1 and Category 2 radioactive sources 
Each transaction may involve multiple shipments carried out over a specified period of time. 
Completed export licence applications should be submitted to the CNSC’s Licensing 
Administrator (Radioactive Sources), via mail, fax or email: 
Licensing Administrator (Radioactive Sources)

11.5 
Licence amendments and transfers 
A CNSC export licence may be amended to:  
• 
change the expiry date  
• 
add or remove consignees  
April 2018 
 
REGDOC-2.13.2, Import and Export, version 2 
 
18 
 
• 
add or remove items authorized for export 
• 
change the sender or recipient address  
• 
change the quantity of items on the existing licence  
• 
modify the end-use  
To request a licence amendment, use the application forms referenced in Appendix D.1 of this 
document. Select the “Amendment Export Licence No” box and complete the relevant section(s) 
of the application form. 
Please note: A licence cannot be amended once the authorized quantity has been exported. 
Similarly, an amendment cannot be made after a licence has expired. Therefore, applications to 
amend licences should be received by the CNSC at least 15 business days before the amended 
licence is required. The transfer of a CNSC export licence from an existing licensee (the 
transferor) to another entity (the transferee) may be authorized by the CNSC upon consideration 
of an application submitted by both entities. Licence transfers may be authorized where a change 
of legal status has occurred and it can be verified that the new licensee (the transferee) is capable 
of ensuring compliance with the NSCA, relevant regulations and all licence conditions. If 
significant changes to the terms and conditions are also proposed, a transfer will not be authorized 
and the applicant for the licence will need to apply for issuance of a new licence. Further 
information can be obtained by contacting the CNSC’s Licensing Administrator (Radioactive 
Sources). 
11.6 
Processing time and service standards 
Applicants can generally expect the CNSC to decide upon the issuance of an export licence 
within 15 business days of receiving a complete application. Incomplete applications cannot be 
processed, and additional information will be required before the assessment can proceed. 
While the CNSC strives to process all applications within 15 business days, the time required for 
processing an application for an export licence is affected, in part, by the scope of international 
communications and consultations that are required. The length of time for completing these will 
depend on a variety of factors, such as the state of the importing country’s regulatory 
infrastructure for the control of radioactive sources, the availability of information on the end-
user, and whether the export item is a Category 1 or Category 2 source. As a result, additional 
time may be required in some cases to process an export licence application. Applicants are 
always encouraged to apply for an export licence at the earliest opportunity.  
The CNSC website provides more information on service standards for import and export 
licences.  
12. 
Evaluation of Licence Applications 
12.1 
Receipt of the application 
Upon receipt of an export licence application, the CNSC sends an email of acknowledgement to 
the applicant. This acknowledgement message assigns a reference number to the application, 
which both the applicant and the CNSC should use in any future correspondence.  
April 2018 
 
REGDOC-2.13.2, Import and Export, version 2 
 
19 
 
The CNSC screens the application to ensure that all information required in the application has 
been submitted by the applicant. If any information is missing, the CNSC will ask the applicant to 
submit it.  
Note: This initial screening does not consider the quality of an application or its technical aspects.   
12.2 
Assessment of application 
The assessment of the application to export risk-significant radioactive sources involves, but is 
not limited to: 
 
• 
review of risk associated with the end-user and consignees involved in the transfer to provide 
assurances that the sources will not be diverted for malicious purposes. Open source and 
classified information may be used in this determination 
• 
review of the regulatory capability of the Importing State to provide assurances that the 
sources will be managed safely and securely 
• 
obtaining import consent from the Importing State Authority for all applications to export 
Category 1 radioactive sources from Canada to further verify the end-users’ authority to 
receive and possess the sources 
12.3 
Decision of the designated officer 
CNSC staff review the application and make a recommendation to the designated officer. The 
decision whether or not to issue the export licence is made by the designated officer pursuant to 
subsection 24(4) of the NSCA.  
If the designated officer is considering denying the application, the applicant will be informed of 
this via a formal letter. Under paragraph 39(1)(a) of the NSCA, the designated officer shall 
provide a reasonable opportunity to be heard to the applicant before refusing to issue a licence. 
As such, the letter identifies the opportunity for the applicant to submit any additional 
information that they believe the designated officer should consider. The letter also provides time 
limits for filing additional information with the designated officer and instructions for submitting 
the information. Rule 27 of the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission Rules of Procedure applies 
with respect to the opportunity to be heard. 
Should the designated officer refuse to issue a licence, the applicant can appeal the decision to the 
Commission. Subsection 43(1) of the NSCA and Rules 29 and 30 of the Canadian Nuclear Safety 
Commission Rules of Procedure apply with respect to a licence appeal. 
13. 
Compliance with CNSC Requirements  
With respect to the export of risk-significant radioactive sources, individuals and companies are 
required to comply with the NSCA, its regulations, licences and their terms and conditions, as 
well as any orders made under the NSCA.   
13.1 
How the CNSC verifies compliance 
The CNSC conducts activities to verify and promote compliance. Audits of licence conditions 
and inspection activities are among the ways that the CNSC verifies compliance with export 
licences.

REGDOC-2.13.2, Import and Export, version 2

Audits of licence conditions 
Subsection 24(5) of the NSCA allows licences to contain any term or condition that the CNSC 
considers necessary for meeting the purposes of the Act. Like other licences issued by the CNSC, 
export licences contain conditions with which the licensee must comply. The conditions included 
within a licence are: 
• 
prior and post shipment notifications 
• 
action to be taken with respect to the CBSA in relation to section 18 of the GNSCR 
The CNSC reviews the information provided by licensees to verify that the authorized quantity of 
the licence has not been exceeded. The CNSC also reviews the information provided as part of 
prior and post shipment notifications to verify that exports are being made in accordance with the 
terms and conditions of licences. 
Inspection activities 
The CNSC uses two general types of inspection activities to verify compliance with export 
licences: 
• 
The first is an audit of export-related documentation at licensees’ facilities. CNSC inspectors 
may review information such as shipping-related documentation, CBSA customs declarations 
and inventory control documents.   
• 
The second is an inspection of goods that have been detained at the border by the CBSA, in 
order to determine if they require a CNSC export licence.   
13.2 
Disclosure of non-compliance 
The CNSC recognizes that responsible exporters may, on occasion, inadvertently fail to obtain 
the appropriate export authorization from the CNSC, as required under the NSCA. Similarly, they 
may unintentionally fail to comply with a condition of an export licence. Exporters in such a 
situation are encouraged to disclose any incidence of non-compliance to the CNSC as soon as 
possible. Appendix B sets out the recommended disclosure procedures to be followed in case of 
non-compliance. 
The CNSC looks favourably upon disclosures if, after considering the information provided 
(including the nature and seriousness of the disclosed violation or omission), it is satisfied that the 
exporter has fully cooperated and taken appropriate measures to prevent future re-occurrence of 
non-compliance. In such instances, no further action is generally warranted.  
If no disclosure is made, the CNSC may consider various options to address non-compliance, 
depending on the gravity of the incidence of non-compliance or on the overall circumstances. 
One such option is to issue an administrative monetary penalty, which is a monetary penalty 
imposed without court involvement for the violation of a regulatory requirement (see the CNSC’s 
website for more information). More serious cases may be referred to the CBSA or the RCMP for 
further review or investigation.

Appendix A: Examples of Possible Suspicious Inquiries or Orders 
The following examples illustrate some situations that could be suspicious. Importers or exporters should 
consider contacting the CNSC at cnsc.export-import.ccsn@canada.ca or applying for an export licence if 
they find themselves in these or similar circumstances: 
 
• 
The customer is new and knowledge about them is incomplete or inconsistent. 
• 
The customer is reluctant to provide information about the end-use of the item or refuses to provide 
an end-use statement. If information is provided, it is vague. 
• 
The customer is unfamiliar with the item and its capabilities but still wishes to purchase the item. 
• 
The item does not fit with the customer’s area of business. An unconvincing explanation is given as 
to why the items are required, given the customer’s normal business or the technical sophistication of 
the items. 
• 
The customer is evasive or is reluctant to indicate whether the item is for domestic use, export or for 
re-export. 
• 
The item is incompatible with the technical level of the destination country. 
• 
The customer is willing to pay cash for an item that normally requires financing or offers to pay a 
higher price. Other examples of unusual payment terms are roundabout wire transfers, late changes in 
deal terms and/or source of payment. 
• 
Routine installation, training or maintenance services are declined. 
• 
The customer makes requests for excessive spare parts or displays no interest in any spare parts. 
• 
The customer requests that the item be transferred to a forwarding address in Canada. 
• 
A freight forwarding company is listed as the final destination. 
• 
Unusual shipping, packaging or labelling arrangements are requested.

Any voluntary disclosure of non-compliance should be accompanied by a cover letter, signed by a senior 
company officer, which clearly states that its purpose is to disclose non-compliance with the Nuclear 
Safety and Control Act, Nuclear Non-proliferation Import and Export Control Regulations, or import and 
export licences. The letter should be addressed to: 
 
Director, Non-Proliferation and Export Controls Division 
Directorate of Security and Safeguards 
Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission 
P.O. Box 1046, Station B 
280 Slater Street 
Ottawa, Ontario 
K1P 5S9

• 
details of the items concerned (including technical specifications for assessment of export control 
status) 
• 
end-use of the item(s) 
• 
dates of all shipments, mode of transport, and port of exit/entry 
• 
quantities and values of each shipment for each product concerned (including copies of the customs 
declaration documents submitted to the CBSA, as well as copies of bills of lading, freight forwarding, 
shipping or commercial invoices) 
• 
contract of sale between the exporter and the final consignee 
• 
for each import/export in question, a statement as to whether the shipment took place intentionally 
• 
description of the circumstances underlying each import/export 
• 
description of the steps taken or processes and procedures put in place to ensure that where required, 
CNSC import/export licences will be obtained in the future 
• 
any other documentation that the importer/exporter believes is relevant to the purpose of the 
disclosure
