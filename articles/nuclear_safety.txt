Nuclear safety has evolved significantly since the early days of nuclear technology. It encompasses a comprehensive set of measures and protocols designed to ensure the safe operation of nuclear facilities and the protection of human health and the environment from potential radiation hazards. Key aspects of nuclear safety include rigorous engineering designs that prevent accidents, robust operational procedures to mitigate risks during routine operations, and stringent emergency preparedness plans to handle any unforeseen events. Safety assessments and inspections conducted by regulatory bodies ensure compliance with international safety standards. Nuclear safety measures are implemented across various stages, from reactor design and construction to decommissioning, with a focus on preventing accidents, maintaining reliable safety systems, and continuously improving safety culture.
