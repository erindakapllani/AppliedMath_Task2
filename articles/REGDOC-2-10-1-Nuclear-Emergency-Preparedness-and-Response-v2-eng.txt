Preface 
This regulatory document is part of the CNSC’s Emergency Management and Fire Protection series of 
regulatory documents. The full list of regulatory document series is included at the end of this document 
and can also be found on the CNSC’s website. 
REGDOC-2.10.1, Nuclear Emergency Preparedness and Response, sets out the emergency preparedness 
requirements and guidance of the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC) related to the 
development of emergency measures for licensees and licence applicants of Class I nuclear facilities and 
uranium mines and mills to satisfy:  
• 
the requirements of subsection 24(4) of the Nuclear Safety and Control Act, by demonstrating that the 
applicant will, in carrying on the proposed activity, make provision for the protection of the 
environment, the health and safety of persons, and the maintenance of national security and measures 
required to implement international obligations to which Canada has agreed 
• 
paragraph 6(k) of the Class I Nuclear Facilities Regulations and subparagraph 3(c)(x) of the Uranium 
Mines and Mills Regulations 
REGDOC-2.10.1 lists and discusses the requirements and guidance that licence applicants and licensees 
shall implement and consider in the design of their emergency preparedness program (EP program). EP 
programs are based on four components: planning basis; program management; response plan and 
procedures; and preparedness. These components are considered in the development of plans to prevent 
or mitigate the effects of accidental releases from a Class I nuclear facility or a uranium mine or mill.  
REGDOC-2.10.1 is based on International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) guidance, and the following 
key IAEA documents were used in its development: 
• 
Preparedness and Response for a Nuclear or Radiological Emergency, IAEA Safety Standards Series 
GS-R-2, Vienna, 2002 
• 
Arrangements for Preparedness for a Nuclear or Radiological Emergency, IAEA Safety Standards 
Series GS-G-2.1, Vienna, 2007 
• 
Preparation, Conduct and Evaluation of Exercises to Test Preparedness for a Nuclear or 
Radiological Emergency, EPR-Exercise, Vienna, 2005 
Applicants and licensees may use these IAEA documents for further guidance, as required. 
REGDOC-2.10.1 is intended to form part of the licensing basis for a regulated facility or activity within 
the scope of the document. It is intended for inclusion in licences as either part of the conditions and 
safety and control measures in a licence, or as part of the safety and control measures to be described in a 
licence application and the documents needed to support that application. 
For proposed new facilities: This document will be used to assess new licence applications for reactor 
facilities.  
Guidance contained in this document exists to inform the applicant, to elaborate further on requirements 
or to provide direction to licensees and applicants on how to meet requirements. It also provides more 
information about how CNSC staff evaluate specific problems or data during their review of licence 
applications. Licensees are expected to review and consider guidance; should they choose not to follow it, 
they should explain how their chosen alternate approach meets regulatory requirements.

For existing facilities: The requirements contained in this document do not apply unless they have been 
included, in whole or in part, in the licence or licensing basis.  
A graded approach, commensurate with risk, may be defined and used when applying the requirements 
and guidance contained in this regulatory document. The use of a graded approach is not a relaxation of 
requirements. With a graded approach, the application of requirements is commensurate with the risks 
and particular characteristics of the facility or activity. 
An applicant or licensee may put forward a case to demonstrate that the intent of a requirement is 
addressed by other means and demonstrated with supportable evidence. 
The requirements and guidance in this document are consistent with modern national and international 
practices addressing issues and elements that control and enhance nuclear safety. In particular, they 
establish a modern, risk-informed approach to the categorization of accidents – one that considers a full 
spectrum of possible events, including events of greatest consequence to the public. 
Other health, safety and environmental considerations may dictate adherence to additional requirements. 
It is the responsibility of licensees to identify any other applicable legislation or standards. 
REGDOC-2.10.1 supersedes Regulatory Guide G-225, Emergency Planning at Class I Nuclear Facilities 
and Uranium Mines and Mills, published in 2001, as well as Regulatory Document RD-353, Testing the 
Implementation of Emergency Measures, published in 2008. It also fulfills a recommendation made by the 
CNSC Fukushima Task Force and the External Advisory Committee to strengthen licensees’ emergency 
preparedness programs. 
Important note: Where referenced in a licence either directly or indirectly (such as through licensee-
referenced documents), this document is part of the licensing basis for a regulated facility or activity.  
The licensing basis sets the boundary conditions for acceptable performance at a regulated facility or 
activity, and establishes the basis for the CNSC’s compliance program for that regulated facility or 
activity.  
Where this document is part of the licensing basis, the word “shall” is used to express a requirement to 
be satisfied by the licensee or licence applicant. “Should” is used to express guidance or that which is 
advised. “May” is used to express an option or that which is advised or permissible within the limits of 
this regulatory document. “Can” is used to express possibility or capability. 
Nothing contained in this document is to be construed as relieving any licensee from any other 
pertinent requirements. It is the licensee’s responsibility to identify and comply with all applicable 
regulations and licence conditions.

Nuclear Emergency Preparedness and Response 
1. 
Introduction 
1.1 
Purpose  
REGDOC-2.10.1, Nuclear Emergency Preparedness and Response, sets out the emergency 
preparedness requirements and guidance of the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC) 
related to the development of emergency measures for licensees and licence applicants of Class I 
nuclear facilities and uranium mines and mills. 
1.2 
Scope 
This regulatory document lists and discusses the components and supporting elements that CNSC 
licensees shall implement and consider when establishing an emergency preparedness program 
(EP program) to prepare for, to respond to, and to recover from the effects of accidental 
radiological/nuclear and/or hazardous substance releases from Class I nuclear facilities or 
uranium mines or mills. REGDOC-2.10.1 refers primarily to nuclear events, but the planning 
basis must also address releases of hazardous materials. In addition, REGDOC-2.10.1 addresses 
how licensees shall test the implementation measures of their EP programs through the conduct of 
exercises. 
This regulatory document applies to all Class I nuclear facilities and uranium mines and mills. 
Some requirements in this document are specifically designated as applying only to nuclear 
power plants and research reactors with a thermal output capacity greater than 10 MW thermal. 
An EP program should be developed in a manner that is commensurate with the complexity of the 
facility’s associated undertakings, as well as the probability and potential severity of the 
emergency scenarios associated with the operation of the licensed facility. 
REGDOC-2.10.1 focuses on the aspects of emergency preparedness and response, while 
requirements for accident management are addressed in REGDOC-2.3.2, Accident Management, 
Version 2. 
1.3 
Accident management and its links with emergency preparedness and the principle 
of defence in depth for power reactors 
An effective response to an emergency requires strong linkages between accident management 
and emergency preparedness. The fundamental premise underlying accident management is that 
the organization operating a nuclear reactor must be able to respond to any accident that cannot 
be practically eliminated in order to: 
• 
prevent the escalation of the accident 
• 
mitigate the consequences of the accident 
• 
achieve a long-term safe stable state after the accident 
Thus, accident management provides capability to respond to an accident within the reactor 
facility. It is important to recognize that accident management interfaces closely but is distinct 
from emergency preparedness, which provides emergency responses to mitigate the onsite and

REGDOC 2.10.1 - Nuclear Emergency Preparedness and Response, Version 2  
 
 
offsite impacts of an accident to workers and the public. Both accident management and 
emergency preparedness form part of the defence-in-depth provisions.  
During a nuclear emergency, the practical goals of emergency response are: 
• 
to regain control of the situation 
• 
to prevent or mitigate consequences at the scene 
• 
to prevent the occurrence of deterministic health effects in workers and the public 
• 
to prevent, to the extent practicable, the occurrence of stochastic health effects in the 
population 
• 
to prevent, to the extent practicable, the occurrence of non-radiological effects in individuals 
and among the population 
• 
to render first aid and to manage the treatment of radiation injuries 
• 
to protect, to the extent practicable, property and the environment 
• 
to prepare, to the extent practicable, for the resumption of normal social and economic 
activity 
The goals of emergency response are most likely to be achieved in accordance with the principles 
for intervention by having an effective EP program as part of the infrastructure for protection and 
safety. An effective EP program ensures that arrangements are in place to ensure a timely, 
coordinated and effective response to any emergency. It also helps to build confidence that an 
emergency response would be managed, controlled and coordinated. 
Figure 1 illustrates links between the accident management, emergency preparedness and defence 
in depth. Accident management focuses on preventing an event that has already occurred from 
escalating and minimizing its radiological releases through use of various physical and procedural 
provisions. The specific provisions may vary depending on the accident (which may be a design 
basis accident or beyond design basis accident, including a severe accident). REGDOC-2.3.2, 
Accident Management, version 2 provides complete descriptions of defence-in-depth levels and 
plant states.  
An EP program establishes how nuclear facilities and other concerned organizations prepare for 
and plan to respond to emergencies (including nuclear or radiological emergencies, both onsite 
and offsite), in order to protect workers, the public and the environment.

1.4 
Overview of Canada’s nuclear emergency management framework 
Emergency management includes the prevention and mitigation, preparedness, response and 
recovery of nuclear emergencies.  
Prevention of nuclear emergencies at Canadian nuclear facilities is the responsibility of the 
licensees. Through the authority of the Nuclear Safety and Control Act (NSCA), the CNSC 
regulates the Canadian nuclear industry in order to prevent unreasonable risk to the environment, 
the health and safety of persons, and national security. Mitigation of nuclear emergencies aims at 
ensuring that equipment, such as hydrogen recombiners, or procedures, such as emergency 
operating procedures, are put in place before a nuclear emergency to reduce the potential 
magnitude or impact of the hazard. Further information on accident management can be found in 
REGDOC-2.3.2, Accident Management. Version 2. 
Preparedness relates to actions taken before a nuclear emergency in order to be ready to respond 
and manage its consequences, and includes the development of response procedures and plans, 
training workers, maintaining emergency facilities, exercises and fostering public awareness.  
Response refers to those actions taken during a nuclear emergency, both onsite and offsite, to 
reduce the magnitude of the hazard and manage its consequences on health, safety and the 
environment. Response actions include protecting workers, supporting accident management 
activities, emergency public communication, emergency medical assistance, and shelter-in-place 
or evacuation.

REGDOC 2.10.1 - Nuclear Emergency Preparedness and Response, Version 2  
 
 
Recovery includes the short-term and long-term actions taken both onsite and offsite in order to 
restore to an acceptable level both the organizations involved in and the communities affected by 
the nuclear emergency. The level of restoration would typically be determined by the responsible 
authorities, in consultation with the stakeholders affected by the nuclear emergency. 
In Canada, the respective roles of the various levels of government in nuclear emergency 
preparedness and response are derived from legislated responsibilities. Provincial and territorial 
governments bear the primary responsibility for protecting public health and safety, property and 
the environment within their borders. The federal government regulates the peaceful use of 
nuclear energy in Canada, manages nuclear liability, and supports the responses of provinces to 
nuclear emergencies within their boundaries.  
The federal government is also responsible for liaisons with the international community and 
diplomatic missions in Canada, for assisting Canadians abroad, and for coordinating Canada’s 
response to nuclear emergencies that occur in foreign countries, but that have an impact on 
Canada.  
Under the administrative framework of the Federal Emergency Response Plan (FERP) and the 
Federal Nuclear Emergency Plan (FNEP), all levels of government, along with various agencies 
and organizations, have responsibilities for developing and implementing emergency plans to 
address nuclear emergencies with impacts outside the boundaries of CNSC-licensed nuclear 
facilities. 
Guidelines for protective actions, such as Health Canada’s Canadian Guidelines for Intervention 
During a Nuclear Emergency and Canadian Guidelines for the Restriction of Radioactively 
Contaminated Food and Water Following a Nuclear Emergency, are intended to assist federal 
and provincial emergency response authorities on choosing appropriate protection actions to 
protect public health. Reference levels in these guidelines are used to inform decisions on what 
measures are necessary to protect the public during a nuclear emergency. These guidelines are 
based, in part, on advice from international organizations such as the IAEA and the ICRP and are 
found on Health Canada’s website.  
1.5 
Relevant legislation 
The CNSC is the federal agency that regulates the use of nuclear energy and materials to protect 
health, safety, security and the environment, and to implement Canada's international 
commitments on the peaceful use of nuclear energy.  
The NSCA requires persons and/or organizations to be licensed by the CNSC for carrying out the 
activities referred to in section 26. The regulations adopted under the NSCA stipulate 
requirements for CNSC licensing, as well as the obligations of licensees and workers. 
One of the CNSC’s objectives is to regulate the development, production and use of nuclear 
energy and the production, possession and use of nuclear substances, prescribed equipment and 
prescribed information in order to prevent unreasonable risk to the environment and to the health 
and safety of persons, as well as unreasonable risk to national security, associated with that 
development, production, possession or use. To accomplish this, the CNSC has the authority to 
make regulations pursuant to section 44 of the NSCA.  
Paragraph 3(1.1)(b) of the General Nuclear Safety and Control Regulations (GNSCR) states that 
the Commission may require any other information that is necessary to enable it to determine 
 
4 
 
February 2016 
REGDOC 2.10.1 - Nuclear Emergency Preparedness and Response, Version 2  
 
 
whether the applicant will make adequate provision for the protection of the environment, the 
health and safety of persons and the maintenance of national security and measures required to 
implement international obligations to which Canada has agreed. Sections 12 and 17 of the 
GNSCR place obligations on both licensees and workers to take all reasonable precautions to 
protect the environment and the health and safety of persons, and to maintain security of nuclear 
facilities and nuclear substances. 
The Class I Nuclear Facilities Regulations and the Uranium Mines and Mills Regulations require 
licence applications to include information related to emergency planning. For instance, 
paragraph 6(k) of the Class I Nuclear Facilities Regulations and subparagraph 3(c)(x) of the 
Uranium Mines and Mills Regulations stipulate that an application for a licence to operate a 
Class I nuclear facility, or a general application for a licence in respect of a uranium mine or mill, 
shall describe the proposed measures to prevent or mitigate the effects of accidental releases of 
nuclear substances and hazardous substances on the environment, the health and safety of 
persons, and the maintenance of security, including measures to:  
• 
assist offsite authorities in planning and preparing to limit the effects of an accidental release 
• 
notify offsite authorities of an accidental release or the imminence of an accidental release 
• 
report information to offsite authorities during and after an accidental release 
• 
assist offsite authorities in dealing with the effects of an accidental release 
• 
test the implementation of the measures to prevent or mitigate the effects of an accidental 
release 
2. 
Emergency Preparedness Program  
An effective EP program is based on the following four components: 
1. Planning basis: an analysis of the risks and hazards that the EP program will address 
2. Emergency response plan and procedures: a comprehensive description of how a response 
will be executed, with accompanying support material 
3. Preparedness: the processes to ensure that people, equipment and infrastructure will be 
ready to execute a response according to the emergency response plan and procedures 
4. Program management: the management system aspects that assure the effectiveness of the 
EP program 
Licensed organizations with an existing EP program that address other corporate needs are 
encouraged to use this infrastructure to meet the requirements in this document. 
Key components and overlapping provisions of emergency preparedness and accident 
management are illustrated in Appendix A. 
2.1 
Planning basis 
All licensees shall: 
1. establish a planning basis for their EP program  
 
5 
 
February 2016 
REGDOC 2.10.1 - Nuclear Emergency Preparedness and Response, Version 2  
 
 
2. ensure the planning basis considers the hazards that have, or could have, an adverse impact 
on the environment and the health and safety of onsite personnel or the public, and also 
consider: 
a. all accidents and internal or external events that have been analyzed as having an 
unacceptable impact on their facilities  
b. the inclusion of multi-unit accidents scenarios for multi-unit power reactor facilities 
c. extended loss of power 
3. use the results from the planning basis to determine the scope and depth of EP program 
requirements 
Additional requirements for licensees of reactor facilities with a thermal capacity greater 
than 10 MW. These licensees shall: 
4. provide regional and provincial offsite authorities with necessary information to allow for 
effective emergency planning policies and procedures to be established and modified, if 
needed, periodically 
Guidance 
Guidance for all licensees  
A nuclear emergency may be caused by, or involve, different types of hazards, including natural 
incidents (e.g., flooding, tornadoes, tsunami, ice or snowstorms, forest fires) and equipment 
malfunctions (identified within the design basis and beyond design basis). All hazards that cannot 
be practically eliminated with possible initiating and propagating pathways should be identified 
within the planning basis. Response to criminal and malicious activity may be dealt with under a 
separate program. 
The planning basis should be based on a full range of postulated scenarios that may challenge the 
facility’s emergency response capabilities. This should include scenarios that involve a nuclear or 
radiological emergency combined with a conventional emergency, such as an earthquake or forest 
fire. A detailed analysis may be used to determine scenarios that can be practically eliminated. 
Plans should be developed for those scenarios that cannot be practically eliminated. Inputs to be 
considered in the analysis should include: the licensee’s safety analysis, probabilistic safety 
analysis, and operating experience.  
Additional guidance for licensees of reactor facilities with a thermal capacity greater than 
10 MW 
The information to be provided to regional and provincial offsite authorities should give all 
necessary details to make informed decisions on the size of emergency planning zones and the 
level of preparedness required. The necessary information should include: 
• 
possible accidents that cannot be practically eliminated 
• 
an estimate of the probability of such accidents occurring 
• 
an estimate of the associated radiological consequences, including isotopic release quantities, 
possible release start time and duration and the geographical area potentially affected 
 
Federal authorities would be provided emergency planning information through the CNSC.

2.2 
Emergency response plan and procedures 
All licensees shall: 
Develop and maintain emergency response (ER) plan(s) with supporting emergency response 
procedures. The ER plan shall be based on the planning basis as described in section 2.1 of this 
document. The ER plan shall identify and describe the methods that licensees use to respond to 
emergencies. This includes, but is not limited to, the following areas:  
1. emergency response organization and staffing 
2. emergency categorization, activation and notification 
3. emergency assessment 
4. offsite response organizations interface and support 
5. emergency personnel protection 
6. emergency response facilities and equipment 
7. emergency information and public communications 
8. recovery  
9. validation of the ER plan and procedures  
Guidance 
Guidance for all licensees 
The ER plan, which may consist of one or several documents, incorporates pertinent information 
directly or by reference. Plan content can vary to accommodate facility-specific needs and 
circumstances based on risk. 
The ER plan may incorporate emergency preparedness and response procedures directly, or it 
may reference pertinent documents, such as the facility procedures manual(s). If referenced, the 
documents should be immediately accessible. 
Procedures are used to define the necessary steps and/or requirements for various emergency 
preparedness and response processes and activities. 
Licensees should also consult RD/GD-99.3, Public Information and Disclosure, concerning 
public disclosure protocols regarding events and developments at their facilities. 
2.2.1 
Emergency response organization and staffing 
All licensees shall:  
In accordance with the ER plan and procedures: 
1. establish an emergency response organization (ERO) with a command structure that is clearly 
defined and integrated  
2. define and document the minimum number of staff required to maintain the ERO and their 
qualifications  
3. define the expected reporting times for the ERO to report to the emergency response facility or 
designated area (see section 2.2.6 of this document) after it has been alerted to respond 
4. document the requirement to maintain and retain logs of all actions, orders, and track and 
update actions throughout the emergency 
 
7 
 
February 2016 
REGDOC 2.10.1 - Nuclear Emergency Preparedness and Response, Version 2  
 
 
Additional requirements for licensees of reactor facilities with a thermal capacity greater 
than 10 MW. These licensees shall: 
5. define and document how the ERO staffing will be maintained and monitored to ensure the 
minimum shift complement is available at the nuclear facility at all times 
6. define and document how licensees will maintain the ERO extended response over multiple 
shifts 
Guidance 
Guidance for all licensees  
An indication of an effective ERO is the demonstration of clear command and control over the 
emergency response. It should be clearly understood who is in charge and with whom final 
decisions and authorities lie. The ERO should be adaptable and flexible, so as to be able to 
manage an incident as it evolves or as its circumstances change rapidly or abruptly. Procedures 
should be in place to ensure: 
• 
clear roles and responsibilities and authorities of each ERO position 
• 
timely and adequate onsite and offsite communication 
• 
periodic update and turnover briefings 
• 
decisions documented in event logs 
• 
effective and clear communication 
Appropriate arrangements should be identified for shift turnover and provision of food and other 
amenities for prolonged duty caused by beyond design basis initiating events. 
Additional guidance on the number of staff required to maintain the ERO and their qualifications 
can be found in CNSC regulatory document G-323, Ensuring the Presence of Sufficient Qualified 
Staff at Class I Nuclear Facilities – Minimum Staff Complement. 
Licensees should also consult G-274, Security Programs for Category I or II Nuclear Material or 
Certain Nuclear Facilities, for further information regarding security aspects of emergency 
preparedness and response. 
Additional guidance for licensees of reactor facilities with a thermal capacity greater than 
10 MW 
Members of mobile offsite survey teams need not be accounted for as part of the minimum 
complement for facilities equipped with real-time fixed radiological detection and monitoring 
capabilities, if the licensee makes provisions for immediate mobilization of offsite survey teams 
upon activation of the ERO.  
Licensees should also consult REGDOC-2.12.1, High-Security Sites: Nuclear Response Force.

February 2016 
REGDOC 2.10.1 - Nuclear Emergency Preparedness and Response, Version 2  
 
 
2.2.2 
Emergency categorization, activation and notification 
All licensees shall: 
Have an ER plan and procedures that: 
1. describe the complete set of conditions that would require activation of the ERO 
2. describe how unusual events, incidents and emergencies are to be determined and classified to 
initiate onsite response; the same notification categories and standard definitions used by 
offsite authorities shall be used and/or cross-referenced 
3. describe the immediate notification process and secondary communication methods to alert all 
onsite personnel, to initiate personnel assembly and accounting, and to activate the ERO and 
associated emergency response and support facilities 
4. define organizational methods, processes, timelines and emergency levels to notify the 
appropriate personnel and authorities 
5. describe all offsite notification requirements and any time requirements that apply, ensuring 
that: 
a. the description includes identification of the appropriate positions, by title and agency, of 
the provincial, territorial and local government agencies 
b. offsite authorities are notified within 15 minutes of categorizing the event 
Additional requirement for all Class I facilities: ensure the CNSC is notified within 15 minutes 
of activation of the ERO. 
Guidance 
Guidance for all licensees 
Criteria that define when the ERO should be activated should be clearly documented. 
Licensees should follow provincial requirements, or when none exist, use the following 
categories, listed in order of increasing significance, to categorize various events:  
• 
reportable event: an event affecting the nuclear facility that would be of concern to the 
offsite authorities responsible for public safety 
• 
abnormal incident: an abnormal occurrence at the nuclear facility that may have a 
significant cause and/or may lead to more serious consequences 
• 
site area emergency: a serious malfunction that results or may result in an emission at a later 
time 
• 
general emergency: an ongoing atmospheric emission of radioactive material, or one likely 
within a short time frame, as a result of a more severe accident  
While item 5b above requires licensees to notify the offsite authorities within 15 minutes of event 
categorization, ideally such notification should be done as soon as possible. It is critical that the 
CNSC and offsite authorities be advised within the identified timeframes. The only acceptable 
exception to the requirement would be when immediate action was required to prevent a

Guidance for all licensees 
Licensees should identify the jurisdictions, organizations or persons that could be formally 
involved in emergency preparedness and response activities pertaining to facility emergencies 
with offsite impacts, and then develop mutual aid and community agreements where appropriate. 
During an emergency it is critical to have an onsite person with the required authority to order 
emergency venting if required. However, this authority can be delegated if it is impractical to 
have a senior emergency officer onsite at all times.  
The ER plan should also define a clear and concise strategy for communications between onsite 
and offsite organizations. All communications, including event data and the decisions made 
throughout the emergency response, should be documented and recorded. While the licensee is 
required to provide recommendations to offsite authorities, it is at the discretion of the authorities 
to accept, reject or modify recommendations. 
The nuclear emergency response plans for offsite response organizations (those of provinces and 
municipalities as well as firefighters, emergency medical services personnel and police) should be 
included with licence application documents for licence renewal and new applications.

Public emergency information 
All licensees shall: 
In accordance with the ER plans and procedures: 
1. provide information about the emergency to offsite authorities during the emergency response 
and recovery phases 
2. coordinate with offsite authorities when communicating emergency information to the public 
Guidance 
Guidance for all licensees 
In the emergency plan, licensees should describe the procedures to communicate information 
about the emergency to offsite authorities during emergencies. These procedures should ensure 
that emergency information is sent routinely – and as conditions change (either positively or 
negatively) – to offsite authorities so the information can be disseminated to the public. 
The information communicated to offsite authorities should include possible radiological and 
non-radiological hazard(s), including their short-term effects as well as their potential long-term 
effects on the public, for all emergency scenarios. 
In the emergency plan, licensees should describe the protocols to ensure coordinated public 
communications during an emergency. For nuclear power plants, provisions should include 
consideration of communications strategies and describe the roles and responsibilities of 
organizations that are responsible for communicating key information to the public. 
2.2.8 
Recovery 
All licensees shall:  
In accordance with ER plans and procedures: 
1. describe the process to transition from emergency response to recovery after the termination 
of an emergency, including the requirements to establish a recovery organization and to 
develop a recovery plan 
2. identify, in the recovery plan, the positions/titles, authorities and responsibilities of the 
individuals who will fill key positions in the recovery organization; this organization shall 
also include technical personnel with responsibilities to develop, evaluate and direct recovery 
and reentry operations 
Guidance 
Guidance for all licensees 
A conceptual and strategic recovery plan should be prepared in advance. This can act as the basis 
for developing the recovery plan after the event has occurred and the emergency phase is 
complete. 
 
16 
 
February 2016 
REGDOC 2.10.1 - Nuclear Emergency Preparedness and Response, Version 2  
 
 
The recovery plan should:  
• 
identify and describe the resources (personnel, facilities and emergency response equipment) 
that are to be available for recovery purposes 
• 
describe how personnel will be protected when assessing or implementing the recovery 
program (e.g., personnel protection measures for entry into hazardous areas) 
• 
provide for post-accident assessments of the causes, details, impacts and/or consequences of 
the events 
• 
ensure all recovery efforts operate in accordance with the licensee’s operating licence 
requirements 
Once the emergency phase of an emergency response has ended, workers undertaking recovery 
operations (such as repairs to plant and buildings, waste disposal or decontamination of the site 
and surrounding area) are subject to the occupational dose limits listed in the CNSC’s Radiation 
Protection Regulations. 
2.2.9 
Validation of the emergency response plan and procedures 
All licensees shall: 
1. validate ER plans and procedures to demonstrate that systems as designed (equipment, 
procedures and personnel elements) meet performance requirements and support safe 
operation 
2. validate any changes to ER plans or procedures before implementing them, to ensure 
continued effectiveness  
3. unless otherwise specified in the licence conditions handbook, notify the CNSC of changes to 
ER plans and procedures, and submit the results of the validation to the CNSC as per the 
terms and conditions of the CNSC licence 
Guidance 
Guidance for all licensees 
For the purpose of this section, “change” means an action that results in modification to, addition 
to, or removal from a licensee’s ER plan. All changes should be validated to demonstrate that 
performance requirements are met and to determine if there has been a reduction in effectiveness 
(i.e., decreased capability to respond to an emergency). 
A licensee may make changes to its ER plan(s) and procedures without CNSC approval, but only 
if it performs and retains an analysis that demonstrates that the changes have not reduced the ER 
plan’s effectiveness. This analysis must also demonstrate that plans continue to meet operating 
licence requirements as well as regulatory requirements.  
A change to a licensee’s ER plan and procedures that reduces the effectiveness of the plan is not 
to be implemented without prior acceptance by the CNSC. A licensee desiring to make such a 
change should submit an application for change approval to the CNSC; the request should include 
the revised ER plan and demonstration of validation. The CNSC will have 30 days to review a 
change request, after which it will inform the licensee if the change has been accepted. The 
CNSC is unlikely to permit changes that would decrease an ER plan’s effectiveness; however, 
under special circumstances (e.g., construction or temporary facility modifications), such changes 
 
17 
 
February 2016 
REGDOC 2.10.1 - Nuclear Emergency Preparedness and Response, Version 2  
 
 
may be approved with specific conditions. Under no circumstances would the CNSC allow a 
licensee to implement changes that would compromise safety or lead to unreasonable risk.  
Minor or administrative modifications to programs or procedures can be reported to the CNSC 
through established channels such as the Quarterly Operations Report or through formal 
correspondence. 
2.3

for any person who would be responding to the emergency on behalf of an offsite authority, 
not just the first responders  
4. establish requirements for frequency of re-qualification training for all ERO positions 
Guidance 
Guidance for all licensees 
Licensees should provide necessary training to individuals and/or organizational units to assure 
and demonstrate they are qualified and able to completely fulfill their assigned emergency 
response roles. The training is intended for any person who would be responding to the 
emergency on behalf of an offsite authority and is not solely limited to first responders. 
ERO training may consist of both formal and informal instruction (including workplace and 
classroom instruction). Licensees can also develop and use online training materials. Emergency 
drills are an additional option. Typical attributes of an emergency drill include:  
• 
limited scope 
• 
limited number of personnel 
• 
specific equipment 
• 
timely feedback 
• 
realistic environment 
An emergency drill typically involves testing a procedural or physical component of the 
emergency response program. An emergency drill may be conducted as an initial or periodic test, 
as a supervised training session or as an evaluation of a remedial event. For example, after steps 
 
18 
 
February 2016 
REGDOC 2.10.1 - Nuclear Emergency Preparedness and Response, Version 2  
 
 
are taken to correct a weakness identified by an emergency exercise, a drill may be held to further 
evaluate the effectiveness of the remedial measures. 
Licensees should describe the following:  
• 
initial and continuing training programs for EROs 
• 
ERO staff qualifications 
• 
ERO positions for which incumbents will be required to undertake periodic or on-going 
training 
• 
training requirements for contractors and offsite organizations (e.g., firefighters, police 
personnel, ambulance drivers, hospital staff) that support or participate in onsite activities – 
insofar as these requirements relate to training that is outside their typical professional duties, 
but that is required for responding to onsite emergencies; such training could address subjects 
like access requirements or radiation protection 
• 
schedules, procedures and assessment criteria for the conduct of emergency drills and 
exercises 
• 
positions responsible for managing, planning, controlling and evaluating drills 
Personnel assigned to emergency response roles should demonstrate and maintain their capability 
to perform assigned tasks at all times. Drills should include the use of all procedures, PPE, 
response equipment and facilities that could be required during an actual emergency. 
Requirements and guidance for training systems can be found in REGDOC-2.2.2, Personnel 
Training. 
2.3.2

Guidance 
Additional guidance for licensees of reactor facilities with a thermal capacity greater than 
10 MW 
Emergency exercises test the adequacy of EP programs and the implementation of emergency 
measures. This includes an evaluation of the adequacy of the procedures and training of the ERO 
to respond to an emergency.  
Emergency exercises simulate emergency events and conditions over a minimum of several 
hours, in order to test the integrated performance of the EP program. Emergency exercises 
simultaneously measure and demonstrate: the preparedness and competence of participants in the 
specific emergency response roles, the quality of the associated procedures, and the effectiveness 
of the administrative framework. Exercises designed with a high degree of fidelity ensure that the 
performance observed could be reasonably expected during an actual event. Deficiencies that are 
identified during emergency exercises should be rectified as soon as possible, to provide 
assurance that the ER plan and procedures can and will be implemented successfully in the event 
of an emergency.  
Typical attributes of an emergency exercise include:  
• 
mobilization of emergency equipment and resources in a realistic environment over an 
extended period of time 
• 
demonstration of inter-agency and other government department cooperation 
• 
testing of communication systems and/or public information systems 
• 
testing of emergency response facilities and equipment readiness 
• 
conduct of the exercise with the minimum complement numbers of staff, in order to 
demonstrate adequacy of the response  
• 
criteria to terminate the exercise that are established ahead of time, in order to ensure that all 
of the required actions are completed 
• 
success criteria that are established during the planning phase, and a corresponding evaluation 
of performance during the exercise 
A full-scale integrated exercise tests the capacity of onsite and offsite agencies to respond to an 
emergency that results in a release of nuclear substances from the affected unit(s). Full-scale 
emergency exercises involve, at minimum, several onsite and provincial and regional offsite 
stakeholders. Larger full-scale exercises can include federal and – where appropriate – 
international authorities and agencies. Emergency exercises do not always need to be full-scale. 
For example, tabletop emergency exercises, such as those for notification and communications, 
may be sufficient to stimulate discussion of various issues regarding a hypothetical emergency.  
Emergency exercises should not be used as part of a participant’s training development. 
Participation in an exercise is not meant to evaluate an individual’s competency, but rather is 
intended to assess the adequacy of an EP program and its implementation. Coaching and training 
should not be provided to participants in exercises by controllers or evaluators. Exercises should 
be conducted in accordance with the minimum requirements of the ER plan.  
Self-assessment reports should contain the following information:  
• 
success and failures of exercise drills 
• 
lessons learned

Guidance 
Guidance for all licensees  
Licensees may, where possible, leverage existing communication channels (such as those used by 
local municipalities or those identified in their public information program as per 
RD/GD-99.3, Public Information and Disclosure). 
Licensees should periodically assess the adequacy of public emergency preparedness information. 
Additional guidance for licensees of reactor facilities with a thermal capacity greater than 
10 MW 
For reactor facilities with a thermal capacity greater than 10 MW and with designated offsite 
emergency planning zones: 
The term ITB agent is used generically and includes potassium iodide (KI) tablets. 
The pre-distribution of ITB agents should be undertaken by representatives of the health and/or 
emergency management authorities of the province or region/municipality, with support from the 
licensee. The pre-distribution of ITB agents should be done in a carefully planned and 
coordinated manner, to ensure that the public receives the appropriate information and education 
related to the benefits, risks and usage instructions of ITB agents.  
Pre-stocked ITB agents for the designated ingestion control planning zone should be located to 
facilitate prompt and efficient distribution during an emergency. Recognizable locations with 
credible persons within the community (such as fire stations, police stations and pharmacies) 
should be considered in the selection of pre-stocking locations. 
Following the completion of pre-distribution activities, periodic reviews with the local 
populations to assess the adequacy of pre-distribution programs should be performed. 
The term “designated plume exposure planning zone” is sometimes referred to as “primary zone”, 
“urgent protective action zone” or “emergency planning zone”. The size of the plume exposure 
planning zone is determined by the appropriate offsite authorities based on information in the 
planning basis and is typically sized in the range of 8 to 16 km. 
The term “designated ingestion control planning zone” is sometimes referred to as “secondary 
zone”, “extended planning distance” or “ingestion planning zone”. Appropriate offsite authorities 
determine the size of the ingestion control planning zone (typically in the range of 50 to 80 km) 
based on information in the planning basis. 
To ensure the public have easy access to the required emergency preparedness information, 
licensees should collaborate with municipalities to provide residents with useful information on 
how they should prepare, what they should expect and how they should respond to an emergency 
at the nuclear facility.  
An emergency preparedness information product should be distributed in hard copy annually to 
every residence, business and institution within the plume exposure planning zone, and posted on 
a variety of websites, including those of the licensees, municipalities and provincial EMOs.

This should include information on: 
• 
how they will be alerted  
• 
how they will be notified or informed on what to do 
• 
sheltering-in-place instructions  
• 
evacuation orders  
• 
how/when to take ITB agents, and where to get them if not pre-distributed  
• 
contact details for where to obtain additional information, such as websites and social media 
sites 
 
Licensees may, where possible, leverage existing communication channels (such as those used by 
local municipalities or those identified in the public information program).  
In discussion with local authorities, licensees should consider providing public preparedness 
information with ITB packages when distributing to local populations.  
2.4 
Program management  
All licensees shall:  
Include, at a minimum, the following elements in their management systems: 
1. a written policy statement issued by licensee senior management, committing all units of the 
organization to the system and its effective implementation 
2. a program owner identified with the authority to ensure that resources are given to all aspects 
of the EP program 
3. procedures describing the planned and systematic actions necessary to provide adequate 
confidence that all specified requirements are satisfied 
4. procedures that specify who (position or unit) is to review and update the program on an 
ongoing basis, and how this is to be done 
5. review and update EP program and associated documentation (e.g., response plan, training 
material, procedures, etc.) at defined intervals to take into account relevant factors, such as 
operating experience, changing needs or circumstances, and lessons learned from real events 
Guidance 
Guidance for all licensees 
The EP program should be managed as part of a facility’s overall management system. A 
management system is generally defined as a set of interrelated or interacting elements that 
establish policies and objectives, and that enables those objectives to be achieved safely, 
efficiently and effectively. The management system brings together the processes needed to 
satisfy EP program requirements in a planned and integrated manner. 
The management system’s requirements primarily aim to ensure that safety is not compromised, 
by considering the implications of all actions with regard to safety as a whole. Safety should be 
the paramount consideration, guiding decisions and actions, in the establishment of a 
management system.

REGDOC 2.10.1 - Nuclear Emergency Preparedness and Response, Version 2  
 
 
As stated in their licences and licence conditions handbooks, licensees should: 
• 
manage their EP programs in accordance with management system requirements  
• 
detect and report deficiencies, and ensure all corrective actions are tracked and implemented 
as per management system requirements
