REGDOC-2.3.1, Conduct of Licensed Activities: Construction and Commissioning Programs 
 
Preface 
This regulatory document is part of the CNSC's Operating Performance series of regulatory documents, 
which also covers accident management and periodic safety reviews. The full list of regulatory document 
series is included at the end of this document and can be found on the CNSC’s website. 
REGDOC-2.3.1, Conduct of Licensed Activities: Construction and Commissioning Programs, sets out 
requirements and guidance for the construction and commissioning of facilities in Canada that use nuclear 
reactors. These facilities (referred to as “reactor facilities” in this document) include: 
• 
nuclear power plants (NPPs) or small reactors for the generation of power or heat for industrial 
process 
• 
small reactors for non-power-generation uses (e.g., isotope production, and research and development 
activities) 
The requirements and guidance in this document apply primarily to NPPs. However, the principles behind 
the requirements and guidance are equally applicable to smaller facilities in a risk-informed (graded) 
manner, and should be considered in the overall safety case for any reactor facility. 
This document is intended to form part of the licensing basis for a regulated facility or activity. It is 
intended for inclusion in licences as either part of the conditions and safety and control measures in a 
licence, or as part of the safety and control measures to be described in a licence application and the 
documents needed to support that application. 
For proposed new facilities: This document will be used to assess new licence applications for reactor 
facilities.   
Guidance contained in this document exists to inform the applicant, to elaborate further on requirements 
or to provide direction to licensees and applicants on how to meet requirements. It also provides more 
information about how CNSC staff evaluate specific problems or data during their review of licence 
applications. Licensees are expected to review and consider guidance; should they choose not to follow it, 
they should explain how their chosen alternate approach meets regulatory requirements.  
For existing facilities: The requirements contained in this document do not apply unless they have been 
included, in whole or in part, in the licence or licensing basis. 
A graded approach, commensurate with risk, may be defined and used when applying the requirements 
and guidance contained in this regulatory document. The use of a graded approach is not a relaxation of 
requirements. With a graded approach, the application of requirements is commensurate with the risks 
and particular characteristics of the facility or activity. 
An applicant or licensee may put forward a case to demonstrate that the intent of a requirement is 
addressed by other means and demonstrated with supportable evidence.

Conduct of Licensed Activities: Construction and Commissioning Programs 
1. 
Introduction 
This document provides a framework within which the requirements and guidance in other 
regulatory documents, codes, and standards may be used in construction and commissioning 
activities. This framework contributes to ensuring that the construction and commissioning of the 
plant is effectively managed and consistent with design requirements.  
1.1 
Purpose 
REGDOC-2.3.1, Conduct of Licensed Activities: Construction and Commissioning Programs, 
sets out the requirements and guidance of the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC) for 
the construction and commissioning of facilities in Canada that use nuclear reactors. These 
facilities (hereafter called “reactor facilities” in this document) include: 
• 
nuclear power plants or small reactors for the generation of power or heat for industrial 
processes  
• 
small reactors for non-power generation uses (e.g., isotope production, and research and 
development activities) 
1.2 
Scope 
Part A of this regulatory document applies to the construction of a new reactor facility, and is 
focused primarily on the structures, systems and components (SSCs) that are important to safety. 
Part B applies to the commissioning of a new reactor facility.  
The principles set out in this document also apply in a graded manner to activities related to the 
life extension, refurbishment and modification of an existing reactor facility.  
Design activities are not addressed in this regulatory document. See CNSC regulatory document 
REGDOC-2.5.2, Design of New Reactor Facilities [1], for the CNSC’s requirements and 
guidance on this related activity. 
Note that, where necessary or deemed important, CANDU-specific experience, requirements and 
expectations are cited in the guidance material in this document. 
1.3 
Relevant regulations 
The sections of the regulations made under the Nuclear Safety and Control Act (NSCA) relevant 
to this document include: 
• 
subsection 24(4) of the NSCA, which provides that “No licence shall be issued, renewed, 
amended or replaced – and no authorization to transfer one given – unless, in the opinion of 
the Commission, the applicant or, in the case of an application for an authorization to transfer 
the licence, the transferee (a) is qualified to carry on the activity that the licence will 
authorize the licensee to carry on; and (b) will, in carrying on that activity, make adequate 
provision for the protection of the environment, the health and safety of persons and the 
maintenance of national security and measures required to implement international 
obligations to which Canada has agreed.”

• 
subsection 24(5) of the NSCA, which provides that “A licence may contain any term or 
condition that the Commission considers necessary for the purposes of this Act…”   
• 
section 3 of the General Nuclear Safety and Control Regulations, which states the general 
licence application requirements 
• 
paragraphs 12(1)(a), (b) and (c) of the General Nuclear Safety and Control Regulations 
stipulate that a “licensee shall: 
• 
(a) ensure the presence of a sufficient number of qualified workers to carry on the licensed 
activity safely and in accordance with the Act, the regulations made under the Act and the 
licence; 
• 
(b) train the workers to carry on the licensed activity in accordance with the Act, the 
regulations made under the Act and the licence; 
• 
(c) take all reasonable precautions to protect the environment and the health and safety of 
persons and to maintain the security of nuclear facilities and of nuclear substances;” 
• 
section 3 of the Class I Nuclear Facilities Regulations, which states the general licence 
application requirements for Class I facilities 
• 
Paragraphs 5(c) and (i) of the Class I Nuclear Facilities Regulations state that “an application 
for a licence to construct a Class I nuclear facility shall contain the following information: 
(c)the proposed construction program, including its schedule; 
(i) the effects on the environment and the health and safety of persons that may result from 
the construction, operation and decommissioning of the nuclear facility, and the measures 
that will be taken to prevent or mitigate those effects;” 
• 
section 6 of the Class I Nuclear Facilities Regulations, which states the licence application 
requirements for a licence to operate under subsection 24(4) of the NSCA 
• 
paragraph 6(g) of the Class I Nuclear Facilities Regulations, which provides that an 
application for a licence to operate a Class I nuclear facility shall contain, in addition to other 
information, “the proposed commissioning program for the systems and equipment that will 
be used at the nuclear facility;” 
• 
paragraph 14(2)(b) of the Class I Nuclear Facilities Regulations, which provides that “Every 
licensee who operates a Class I facility shall keep a record of the results of the 
commissioning program referred to in the licence;”  
2. 
Management System 
Licensees shall manage construction and commissioning activities in accordance with their 
management system as defined in the licensing basis. This document further clarifies how the 
management system’s generic requirements apply specifically to construction and commissioning 
activities. 
Guidance 
All construction, commissioning and related activities should be developed and implemented 
under the control of the licensee using a management system meeting the requirements of 
CSA N286, Management system requirements for nuclear facilities [2].

Part A: Construction of Reactor Facilities 
 
3. 
Management and Organization 
3.1 
Role of the licensee 
The licensee shall have the primary responsibility for safety and security of all construction 
activities, including work carried out on its behalf by contractors. The licensee shall also have 
within its organization the knowledge, expertise and resources to maintain control and oversight 
of safety at all times.  
Guidance 
The licensee’s responsibilities cover all aspects related to the construction of the facility. Some 
examples of the licensee’s responsibilities are: 
 
• 
confirming the facility is being built in accordance with the design basis, regulatory 
requirements, and applicable codes and standards 
• 
maintaining ownership of the safety case, including the information provided by the design 
and construction organizations and contractors  
• 
providing a point of contact for communicating with the CNSC on all matters related to the 
facility’s construction 
• 
ensuring construction program documents are prepared and updated 
• 
ensuring construction instructions and procedures are established 
• 
ensuring inspections, tests and verification of SSCs important to safety are performed 
• 
ensuring safety-significant inspection findings are evaluated and reporting the evaluation 
results to the CNSC 
• 
identifying jurisdictional boundaries and responsibilities where there is more than one 
regulatory body governing a particular area 
Construction and commissioning are an integral part of design assurance for the nuclear facility. 
For activities important to design assurance where commissioning is not practicable, special 
attention should be placed on assurance of construction. 
Reactor facilities will likely be constructed by contractors and subcontractors with the licensee 
undertaking primarily an oversight role. Nonetheless the licensee has the primary responsibility 
for safety, and must ensure directly, or indirectly, that adequate provisions have been made for 
the safety of the public, workers and the environment for all construction activities. Effective 
oversight of construction activities is essential to maintain the construction safety case and to 
support the operations safety case. 
As the licensee is directly responsible for managing its contractors, this should be reflected in 
contractual arrangements between the parties. Relevant arrangements between the licensee and 
major contractors should then cascade down into the contracts throughout the supply chain of 
SSCs important to safety. 
 
3 
 
 
 
 
January 2016 
REGDOC-2.3.1, Conduct of Licensed Activities: Construction and Commissioning Programs 
 
It is the responsibility of the licensee and those involved in the supply chain to understand the 
applicable requirements set out in the NSCA and the regulations for the contract they are seeking 
to place. The contracting party should document all relevant requirements without an over 
reliance on referencing other documents. This will ensure that there is clear understanding 
between all parties on how to implement all relevant requirements. 
Although it is the responsibility of the licensee to ensure compliance with applicable 
requirements, all parties within the supply chain should understand the nuclear safety significance 
of the contracted work, and be able to demonstrate that arrangements have been made to comply 
with the contract’s specifications. Each link in the supply chain should therefore ensure that its 
staff, and any subcontractors, are suitably trained and briefed on their responsibilities under the 
relevant requirements, and that suitable measures are implemented to assure compliance with 
contract specifications. 
The licensee should have the capability to understand the nuclear safety significance of any 
purchased expertise or equipment, specify requirements, supervise the work, and technically 
review the output before, during and after implementation. This is known as the intelligent 
customer capability. 
Contractors at all levels in the supply chain should expect to be audited on a regular basis as part 
of contractual arrangements. Contractors could also be visited by the CNSC as part of regulatory 
oversight, particularly if the equipment they are manufacturing has high nuclear safety 
significance. 
3.2 
Construction management 
3.2.1 
 Regulatory and other requirements 
The licensee shall identify health and safety, environmental, and other requirements applicable to 
construction activities. Relevant requirements shall be communicated to all parties and taken into 
account when establishing, implementing and maintaining management practices and controls. 
Conflicting requirements shall be identified and resolved. 
3.2.2 
 Interface arrangements 
Before construction starts, interfaces between the licensee and the CNSC, as well as the licensee 
and other regulatory authorities, shall be defined, agreed upon and understood such that the 
CNSC and other regulatory authorities are provided with relevant performance issues that have 
affected, or have the potential to affect, the quality of construction and future operational safety 
of SSCs. The interface arrangements shall be specified in management system documentation and 
in appropriate contracts. 
3.2.3 
 Oversight of contractors 
The licensee shall develop measures to ensure that contractors and subcontractors meet their 
respective contractual obligations in accordance with an appropriate safety management system. 
The licensee shall maintain records of its oversight activities and report to the CNSC relevant 
contractor performance that has affected, or has the potential to affect, the quality of construction 
and future operational safety. 
Guidance 
 
4 
 
 
 
 
January 2016 
REGDOC-2.3.1, Conduct of Licensed Activities: Construction and Commissioning Programs 
 
As part of contractor oversight, the licensee should: 
• 
take both qualitative and quantitative measures, appropriate to the safety significance of the 
SSCs, to monitor conformance and enable trends  
• 
take proactive measures of performance that monitor conformance 
• 
take reactive measures of performance which enables trends to be monitored 
• 
monitor the effectiveness of controls for the management systems/quality assurance programs 
• 
retain relevant information as evidence of the results and report to the CNSC relevant 
contractor performance that has affected, or has the potential to affect, the quality of 
construction and future operational safety 
Examples of proactive measures include: 
• 
assessments of compliance with regulatory and other requirements 
• 
the effective use of the results of workplace safety tours or inspections 
• 
evaluation of the effectiveness of training 
• 
use of behaviour observations 
• 
use of perception surveys to evaluate safety culture and related worker satisfaction 
• 
the effective use of internal and external audits 
• 
completion of regulatory commitments as scheduled 
• 
the extent to which management system / quality assurance programs have been implemented 
• 
the effectiveness of worker participation process 
• 
benchmarking of good construction practices 
• 
work activity assessments 
The following should be considered for contractor performance when it has the potential to affect 
the quality of construction and future operational safety performance: 
• 
for selection of contractors:  
• 
confirmation that the contractors have the ability to supply the goods or services 
• 
acceptance of the contractor’s management system through review of documentation and 
audit 
• 
confirmation that the contractor understands all regulatory requirements 
• 
resolution of any exceptions the contractor has to the licensee’s requirements  
• 
reviews of contractor submissions against requirements 
• 
for contract management: 
• 
evidence of a positive safety culture 
• 
evidence that the contractor satisfies all contractual requirements related to health and 
safety, environment, security, control of materials and quality  
• 
problem identification and resolution, and effective corrective action programs  
• 
for contractor supply chain (manufacturing and construction) activities: 
• 
pre-screening of subcontractors used by the contractor, to ensure the subcontractors are 
acceptable and to incorporate them into the licensee’s supply chain program 
• 
verification that the specification used for purchasing equipment, materials and 
components have been met 
• 
review of contractor manufacturing or construction documentation, including quality 
plans/manufacturing and inspection and test plans, and special process procedures 
 
5 
 
 
 
 
January 2016 
REGDOC-2.3.1, Conduct of Licensed Activities: Construction and Commissioning Programs 
 
• 
source verification and audits, during manufacturing and construction, to verify 
compliance of the contractor or its subcontractors  
• 
review and disposition of any contractor non-conformances to requirements 
 
The above guidance should also extend to the contractor’s measures to ensure its subcontractors 
meet their respective obligations. 
3.3 
Programs supporting construction activities 
3.3.1 
 Security 
Security measures shall include the prevention of, detection of, and response to, criminal or 
intentional, unauthorized acts involving or directed at construction activities, and other intentional 
acts that could directly or indirectly produce harmful consequences. Security measures shall 
extend to: 
1. physical security of the site 
2. personal security 
3. protection of information 
4. document security 
5. cyber security 
Guidance 
The security program should include the actions to be taken to protect SSCs under construction 
and to detect and deter conditions that would otherwise impair site security.  
It is understood that as construction proceeds, the focus and requirements of the security program 
will evolve. The following key elements should be reviewed to ensure that the necessary 
provisions are made for security: 
• 
security measures in place are commensurate with onsite conditions such as commercial 
‘loss control’, whether there is nuclear material on site, and turnover to operations  
• 
access control of personnel, materials and vehicles 
• 
scheduled and random patrols and inspections 
• 
screening (pre-employment and gate clearance) for access to work areas  
• 
physical barriers, fencing, surveillance and monitoring capability 
• 
cyber security controls to protect computer-based systems 
• 
response capability 
 
The following regulatory documents provide specific requirements and guidance for security 
programs: RD-321, RD-361, REGDOC-2.12.1-3, G-205, G-208 (only if fuel onsite under the 
licence to construct). 
3.3.2 
Safeguards 
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) shall have access to the site and information 
about site buildings and structures, operational parameters, flow and storage of nuclear material, 
and installation of safeguards surveillance and monitoring equipment consistent with the Canada-
IAEA safeguards agreements.

January 2016 
REGDOC-2.3.1, Conduct of Licensed Activities: Construction and Commissioning Programs 
 
3.3.3 
 Personnel training and qualification 
Personnel engaged in construction activities shall have appropriate training, qualifications and 
competence to perform their assigned tasks effectively and safely.  
Guidance 
REGDOC-2.2.2, Human Performance Management: Personnel Training, [3] provides specific 
requirements and guidance for training programs. 
 
The training programs should emphasize the importance of adhering to established programs, 
processes and procedures in assuring nuclear safety in future phases of the project (e.g., 
commissioning and operation). Training programs should further emphasize that everyone 
working at the site is responsible for safety in all construction activities. 
 
Operational phase training and personnel certification approaches, such as for those who will be 
involved in commissioning, operation, maintenance and technical support activities should be 
considered. It is understood that training program provisions evolve as construction progresses. 
3.3.4 
 Effect on and from existing facilities  
As part of its assessment of safety and security during construction, the licensee shall consider all 
hazards to or from nearby site facilities and any interdependence of safety systems. The 
consequences of potential contamination (nuclear and hazardous substances) from a construction 
site to operating units, as well as from operating site to construction site, shall be assessed and 
any contamination monitored as necessary. All other potential risks shall also be assessed (e.g., 
excavation, accidental fall of cranes, use of explosives). Such consideration shall also include an 
impact assessment of cumulative environmental discharges for all facilities on the site. 
The responsibilities of the relevant licensee(s) and the construction organization for safety and 
security shall be agreed upon before the start of construction activities at the site. Close 
communication and cooperation between the parties shall be established. All steps shall be taken 
to ensure that the existing facility can be operated safely and securely during construction 
activities.  
For adjacent installations or those with common buildings or services, the boundaries of the 
following shall be identified:  
1. physical 
1. system 
2. controlled areas  
3. security access 
4. clean zones 
When using the resources of existing nuclear installations (e.g., water, electric power or security), 
clear interfaces shall be defined so as not to jeopardize operating installations.  
Emergency plans shall take full account of the presence of other parties in the area. Procedures 
shall be implemented to ensure the licensee of an existing facility or facilities endorses a change 
of status for those common buildings or services before the construction organization puts such 
plans in place.

REGDOC-2.3.1, Conduct of Licensed Activities: Construction and Commissioning Programs 
 
3.3.5 
 Emergency management and fire protection 
The licensee shall ensure an appropriate plan is in place for managing emergencies during 
construction.   
Fire protection controls (i.e., temporary measures to mitigate potential fires) shall be available 
until final systems for plant fire detection, protection and suppression are installed and 
operational. Details of these controls shall be included in the emergency preparedness 
arrangements. 
Guidance 
REGDOC-2.10.1, Nuclear Emergency Preparedness and Response, [5] provides specific 
requirements and guidance on emergency preparedness. 
 
For construction sites at existing nuclear facilities, emergency measures should include a risk and 
threat assessment to identify any increased risks to the site. Preventive measures should include 
managing risk to the existing facility, by construction activities such as dredging, quarrying and 
blasting, and the creation of connections between the site and the facility. 
The proximity of other nuclear facilities should be considered so that mutual aid agreements may 
be put in place to support emergency response. As construction proceeds the licensee should 
ensure that emergency measures in place are commensurate with onsite hazards. 
4. 
Readiness Review 
In preparation for construction, the applicant/licensee shall ensure the contractors are ready to 
proceed with construction by verifying that:  
1. management systems are in place  
2. adequate planning has been conducted  
3. procedures and training are complete 
4. construction hazards are adequately evaluated and control measures identified  
These activities shall be accomplished through a construction readiness review. 
Guidance 
The following areas should be assessed in a construction readiness review: 
• 
Regulatory requirements: Focus on confirming all regulatory requirements have been 
satisfied. This includes obtaining all required licences and permits from federal, provincial 
and municipal agencies. 
• 
Management system: Focus on aspects of the management system, organization and staffing 
for the execution of the construction project. It is expected that key construction positions are 
established, related organizational roles and responsibilities are clear, and project staff are 
sufficiently staffed to oversee construction activities. Additionally, management systems 
should be in place to monitor performance against the project baseline.

important to safety to conditions for which they were not designed. 
Guidance 
See RD/GD-210, Maintenance Programs for Nuclear Power Plants, [6] and REGDOC-2.6.3, 
Fitness for Service: Aging Management, [7] for more information.  
Examples of environmental conditions where allowable limits should be specified during 
construction work include temperature, pressure, humidity, dust, dirt, airborne salt, wind, and 
electromagnetic conditions. 
Foreign material exclusion measures should include provisions for preventing the introduction of 
outside materials, debris, tools, and components into the systems and components, and areas 
where they pose a health and safety hazard or environmental impact. 
Installed SSCs should be protected from personnel traffic, temporary structures, weather, and 
adjacent construction activities (such as sandblasting, acid cleaning, welding, jackhammering, 
chipping, burning, and stress relieving) that would adversely affect the quality of the SSCs or any 
test results. The protection may be provided through good cleanliness and housekeeping 
practices, temporary packaging, erection of barriers, protective covers, and walkways as required. 
Specific requirements and cleaning methods should be implemented for systems such as 
hydraulic and instrumentation control systems and lubrication lines, as well as for those where 
interior surfaces are generally not accessible for visual inspection. 
The compatibility of cleaning methods and materials with the components being cleaned and 
cleanliness of components after cleaning should be confirmed. The latter includes any remnants 
of preservatives or cleaning agents on components before installation 
Fluid and gas piping systems, and associated components should be laid up, cleaned, flushed and 
conditioned according to applicable chemistry requirements. Chemistry staff, facilities and 
procedures should be available to support system flushing and hydrostatic testing to ensure 
requirements are met. 
Waste materials and remaining consumables used or generated onsite during construction should 
be removed after work is complete. 
5.6

core extraction and testing for the entire concrete and backfill program in accordance with the 
technical specifications covering the supply of concrete and backfill 
• 
rebar assembly 
• 
pipe spool fabrication 
• 
modular assembly, such as: 
• 
mechanical modules: structural equipment on a common structural frame, along with 
interconnecting piping, valves, instruments and wiring 
• 
structural modules: liner, wall, floor, heat sink floor, turbine pedestal form, stairs, 
platform, structural steel, and space frame modules; some structural modules may include 
leave-in-place formwork for concrete 
• 
piping modules: pipe, valves, valve tree, pumps and associated instrumentation and 
wiring on a common structural frames 
• 
electrical modules: electrical modules on a common structural frame 
• 
other onsite activities to facilitate construction 
When specialty construction equipment is required (e.g., very heavy lift cranes, automated rebar

6. 
Turnover of Work  
6.1 
Turnovers during construction 
The licensee shall ensure that a process for turnover of SSCs important to safety is established.  
Guidance 
Process and procedures should be established to control and coordinate the turnover of completed 
work and associated facility configuration information from one party to another (e.g., from civil 
to mechanical, piping and electrical) to maintain completed work integrity. Access control for 
SSCs important to safety and work areas should also be established and implemented for the 
transfer. Transfer requirements and responsibilities should be documented. 
When SSCs and work areas are to be transferred between parties within the construction 
organization or contractors, both parties should jointly check the SSCs and work areas as well as 
the facility configuration information. Both parties should agree on the configuration of the SSCs 
and work areas and how to address any identified deficiencies. 
After turnover, further work or corrective actions by the previous party should only be done with 
appropriate authorization by the party who has received the work and the licensee. 
6.2 
Turnover of work to operations/commissioning  
Guidance 
Process and procedures established to control and coordinate the turnover of work should include 
the following activities: 
• 
review of the facility configuration information relating to SSCs, and areas by the party 
turning over the work and the party receiving it for completeness and accuracy 
• 
performance of tests to ensure the SSCs have been manufactured, constructed and installed 
according to design specifications  
• 
identification and assessment of any remaining non-conformances or incomplete components, 
to ensure there is no safety implication during commissioning activities 
• 
development of inaugural or baseline inspection data for systems or components for 
comparative purposes for in-service inspection 
• 
agreement upon, planning and scheduling of any outstanding work  
• 
identification of termination points of the boundaries of turned over SSCs (or parts thereof)  
in turnover documentation with associated required configuration 
• 
inspection of turned over components and associated records and documents 
• 
assessment of compatibility of information and communication technology systems when 
turning over electronic documents and records 
• 
documentation of the turnover of responsibilities  
• 
establishment and turnover of approved as-built plans together with adequate and precise 
plant configuration details 
• 
marking and tagging of all SSCs turned over  
 
14 
 
 
 
 
January 2016 
REGDOC-2.3.1, Conduct of Licensed Activities: Construction and Commissioning Programs 
 
Turnover requirements and responsibilities should be documented. The level of technical detail in 
turnover documentation should be sufficient to allow the recipient to identify parts and order 
replacements for maintenance. All relevant information should be copied to the parties who will 
be responsible for aging management.  
7. 
Configuration Control 
7.1 
Facility configuration information 
Recorded information that describes, specifies, certifies, or provides data or results created during 
construction, as part of the facility configuration information, shall be agreed to, planned and 
processed so as to facilitate its turnover to commissioning and operations in the agreed form, 
format and required quality. 
Guidance 
To enable successful turnover of facility configuration information created during construction, 
the following should be considered: 
• 
What information is required for turnover?  
• 
Who will produce the required information? 
• 
How will the information be delivered (i.e., electronically or paper copies)? 
• 
When will the information be delivered (i.e., timing and frequency)? 
• 
Who will receive the information turned over? 
• 
Where will the information be stored? 
• 
Who is responsible for the information’s management and integrity? 
The control of construction records should be established at the beginning of the construction 
program for input into the schedule for accomplishing construction activities.  
Visual construction records of as-built conditions should be compiled, particularly in inaccessible 
areas or areas that will be subject to intense radiation, to facilitate the planning of work in these 
areas during commissioning, operation and decommissioning. These records should show 
identification marks and should be catalogued with descriptive captions. This will ensure that 
visual records made during subsequent inspections or maintenance work can be easily compared, 
and will help in any work preparation. 
7.2 
Changes to facility configuration information 
Changes that occur in the course of construction shall be processed to maintain conformance 
among the design requirements, the physical configuration and the facility configuration 
information. The CNSC shall be notified where configuration changes have an impact on the 
submitted design and licensing basis information.

 Part B: Commissioning of Reactor Facilities 
8. 
Management and Organization 
8.1 
Organizational responsibilities 
The licensee shall have the primary responsibility for safety and security and shall oversee the 
organization, planning, execution and assessment of the commissioning program. 
The licensee shall be responsible for the construction, commissioning and operating 
organizations, which may be part of the licensee’s organization or from a contracted organization 
responsible for their scope of work. 
The licensee shall ensure that necessary resources are available to carry out the commissioning 
activities and to establish, implement, assess and continually improve commissioning activities. 
During and following commissioning, under the overall direction of the licensee:  
1. the construction organization shall ensure that SSCs have been constructed as per design and 
that quality assurance requirements have been satisfied 
2. the commissioning organization shall ensure that SSCs are tested to provide assurance that 
the reactor facility has been properly designed and constructed and is ready for safe operation 
3. the operating organization shall: 
a. carry out operation and maintenance  
b. satisfy itself that the systems transferred comply with the specified performance, 
design intent and safety case 
c. satisfy itself through integrated system validation exercises that the human-
machine system design and supporting mechanisms facilitate human 
performance in achieving safety and operational goals 
d. accept responsibility for the transferred systems 
e. become competent in the management and operations of the reactor facility 
f. ensure that there will be a sufficient number of qualified workers to operate the 
facility 
4. SSCs shall be operated in accordance with the assumptions and intent of the commissioning 
program, respecting the relevant operating limits and conditions that apply to each testing 
stage 
5. the responsibilities of other participants, such as designers, manufacturers and supporting 
technical organizations, shall be specified in appropriate documents 
Interface arrangements shall be identified and agreed upon between the licensee, commissioning 
organization, operating organization, construction organization and any other organizational units 
performing the work. The interface arrangements shall be specified in management system 
documentation and in appropriate contracts. 
Interface control shall include the assignment of responsibilities and the establishment of 
procedures for the identification, review, approval, release, distribution and release of documents 
that cross organizational boundaries. 
 
17 
 
 
 
 
January 2016 
REGDOC-2.3.1, Conduct of Licensed Activities: Construction and Commissioning Programs 
 
Guidance 
Responsibilities of each organization should remain clear at all times, even if activities overlap in 
respect to the use of personnel. The participating organizations may adopt various arrangements 
in discharging their responsibilities. Appendix E provides examples of typical responsibilities, 
and appendix F gives further guidance on recommended interface arrangements. 
Commissioning activities should be aligned with the regulatory licensing process. The principal 
activities performed in commissioning may be divided into the following categories: 
• 
those associated with the final stage of construction and installation of the reactor facility 
• 
those specific to commissioning, including testing and safety review activities 
• 
those associated with the operation, security and maintenance of the reactor facility 
Accordingly, personnel performing the above activities may belong to the construction, 
commissioning or operating organizations, depending on industrial practice and contractual 
arrangements, as well as on the physical size and design of the reactor facility. The composition 
of these organizations may also be influenced by the availability and experience of personnel 
performing specialized functions. If the licensee decides to contract the commissioning activities 
to another organization, it should be made clear that the ultimate responsibility for commissioning 
and safety remains with the licensee. 
8.2 
Personnel training and qualification 
Personnel engaged in commissioning activities shall have appropriate training, qualifications and 
competence to perform their assigned tasks effectively. 
Guidance 
REGDOC-2.2.2, Human Performance Management: Personnel Training, [3] and RD-204, 
Certification of Persons Working at Nuclear Power Plants, [4] provide specific requirements and 
guidance for training and personnel certification programs respectively. 
Training program subjects relevant to the commissioning program should include, but are not 
limited to: 
• 
commissioning organization and structure 
• 
commissioning procedures 
• 
reactor facility systems   
• 
conduct of testing and maintaining the reactor facility in safe conditions 
• 
procedural and design changes 
• 
permanent and temporary modifications 
• 
work control and equipment isolation 
• 
interfaces of construction, design and operation with commissioning 
• 
test limitation boundaries in mechanical and electrical systems 
• 
the criteria for, and importance of, reporting incidents and deviations 
• 
commissioning methods and techniques 
• 
safety culture 
 
18 
 
 
 
 
January 2016 
REGDOC-2.3.1, Conduct of Licensed Activities: Construction and Commissioning Programs 
 
• 
nuclear safety, industrial safety, fire protection, emergency preparedness, radiation protection 
and security  
• 
design criteria, technology and operational limits and conditions (or the equivalent) for the 
reactor facility  
• 
environmental protection and waste management of spent fuel and radioactive waste   
• 
full-scope simulator training of operators for reactor start-up, regular operations, reactor 
shutdown and cool down and handling of various transients, including accidents 
8.3 
Problem identification, resolution, and continual improvement 
The operating organization shall be responsible for problem identification, resolution, and 
continual improvement during commissioning. 
Guidance 
Personnel should be made aware that they are expected to identify and report non-conformances.  
A system should be in place to define non-conformances and specify the roles and responsibilities 
of the licensee, commissioning organization, and other involved organizations for reporting and 
correcting non-conformances. In addition, this system should incorporate the regulatory approval 
process for handling problems and non-conformances when required. 
The commissioning stage yields much information that should be taken into account in the 
subsequent operation of the reactor facility. Systematic processes and procedures should be 
established for reporting on and analyzing abnormal events, human errors and “near misses”. 
Experience gained at this stage should be fed back into the training program for commissioning 
and operating personnel. Available information on operating experience, including reportable 
occurrences at the operating power reactor, should be used appropriately in developing and 
executing procedures. Consideration should also be given to the need for any changes in the 
design and related documents. 
9. 
Commissioning Program 
The licensee shall establish and implement a program for the commissioning of a reactor facility 
that:  
1. defines clear responsibilities for commissioning activities and oversight, specifying interfaces 
between design, construction, commissioning and operating organizations 
2. is structured to enable the objectives and methods of testing to be understood and to allow 
management control and coordination 
3. outlines the testing that must be performed to ensure that SSCs important to safety are built as 
designed and meet the requirements of the facility design and safety analysis 
4. verifies safety analysis assumptions and the presence of adequate safety and operating 
margins between design, safety requirements and normal operating conditions 
5. ensures tests are only conducted if the reactor facility falls within the range of assumptions 
made in the safety analysis and the licensing basis remains valid 
6. includes provision of temporary utilities (i.e., power, HVAC, demineralized water, fire 
protection, lightning, communications, compressed air, waste water processing and 
discharge) 
 
19 
 
 
 
 
January 2016 
REGDOC-2.3.1, Conduct of Licensed Activities: Construction and Commissioning Programs 
 
7. identifies the security systems to be commissioned before nuclear fuel or material is brought 
onsite 
8. documents the testing results and identifies any impacts on or changes to the facility design 
basis 
9. validates operating and surveillance procedures for which the commissioning tests provide 
representative activities and conditions 
10. verifies operating and emergency procedures by trial use 
11. ensures integrated system validation of control rooms and control areas 
12. ensures a schedule, including milestones and regulatory hold points, and test results to be 
submitted for review are identified and communicated to the CNSC 
The licensee shall submit the commissioning program in advance of commissioning activities 
within an agreed-upon lead time to ensure sufficient time for regulatory reviews and for any 
concerns raised during the review process to be adequately addressed. The lead time will be 
related to the size of the facility and the extent of the commissioning proposed. For a new build 
power reactor the lead time will typically be in the order of one year. 
For sites that will contain multiple reactor facilities, the commissioning program shall clearly 
identify and track commissioning activities for each individual unit or module. 
The content of the final safety analysis report shall be updated according to commissioning 
results. 
Guidance 
IAEA documents SSG-28, Commissioning for Nuclear Power Plants, [8] and NS-G-2.3, 
Modifications to Nuclear Power Plants, [9] define recommended commissioning programs for 
new facilities and modifications to existing facilities, respectively. The commissioning program 
for a new facility should cover the integrated plant and all the SSCs, including any interfaces with 
existing operating facilities onsite. For the life extension, refurbishment and modification of an 
existing reactor facility, the extent of commissioning activities is recognized to be different. In 
these cases, the commissioning program should address the impact of design modifications (both 
hardware and software), as well as the work done on the SSCs that were dismantled or laid-up 
during the extended outage. Once these SSCs are satisfactorily checked and tested for readiness 
to load fuel, the commissioning program – from fuel load to full power – should be similar, if not 
identical to a new facility commissioning program. 
To assist in developing the applicable commissioning program, the licensee should categorize the 
SSCs as defined below, to reflect their status and scope of work performed. 
Category A: Systems that remain in normal operation with continued health monitoring 
and routine maintenance program activities  
Temporary changes may have been implemented on some of these systems, to enable them to 
provide necessary service throughout the outage. No formal commissioning is required to return 
these systems to normal service. However, any temporary changes should be carefully removed 
and normal operation restored, in accordance with the operating procedures. 
 
20 
 
 
 
 
January 2016 
REGDOC-2.3.1, Conduct of Licensed Activities: Construction and Commissioning Programs 
 
Category B: Systems that are shut down and placed in a laid-up state  
This includes systems that may have been disconnected or dismantled to provide proper access to 
perform work. Depending on the nature of the work involved, some commissioning activities 
may be required to confirm that the system has been reinstalled correctly and performs in 
accordance with the design specifications. 
Category C: New installed systems or existing systems that have had portions of systems or 
components modified.  
Commissioning would be required to confirm that the modified system – and the integrated plant 
– performs in accordance with the design specifications. 
The extent and depth of the commissioning program is dependent on various factors. In situations 
where a commissioning requirement may not be applicable, the licensee may make a justification 
for not meeting the requirement, or propose an alternate method of compliance (which will be 
reviewed by CNSC staff). 
10. 
Commissioning Tests 
10.1 
Test objectives 
Testing is the core activity of the commissioning program. It shall be sufficiently comprehensive 
to demonstrate that the reactor facility can operate in the modes for which it has been designed.  
In developing test objectives, the safety functions of the SSCs important to safety shall be 
systematically reviewed to ensure that all safety requirements are met. 
Where it is deemed impractical to fully test the functionality of  SSCs important to safety for all 
design-basis events, gaps in testing shall be identified and documented. Additional compensatory 
measures (such as computer simulation, additional verification or third-party review) shall be 
documented to compensate for the gaps in the commissioning assurance provided by testing.    
10.2 
Test scope and methods  
Tests necessary to demonstrate operability, safety and safety-related functions shall be fully 
performed. For tests that cannot be performed to their fullest extent, it shall be documented how 
the safety and design intent is met. 
Functional and performance requirements and parameters that clearly identify the approach used 
for each testing aspect shall be defined.  
The commissioning program shall have provisions to ensure there have been no omissions in 
testing complex systems. The combination of testing and other means of assurance (where testing 
is impractical) shall be such that risk to the public and environment is assured to be within the 
licensing envelope of the facility. 
Tests shall be performed under the most realistic operating conditions practicable and shall 
confirm analytical tool validation. 
 
21 
 
 
 
 
January 2016 
REGDOC-2.3.1, Conduct of Licensed Activities: Construction and Commissioning Programs 
 
Facility-level integrated tests shall be performed for every reactor facility, irrespective of the 
availability of similar or identical tests from other single- or multi-unit reactor facilities. Where 
integrated testing cannot be performed for safety reasons, the licensee shall provide a technical 
argument that includes acceptable testing alternatives to meet the objectives of the commissioning 
program. 
For any offsite tests, their applicability at the component level shall be documented. Their 
applicability shall also be documented when integrated at system and facility levels. 
For multi-unit reactor facilities: 
1. component- and system-level integration tests shall be done onsite for every unit in the 
reactor facility 
2. special provisions shall be made to ensure that the commissioning tests of a unit do not 
jeopardize the safety of another unit; such provisions shall include safety analysis (of the 
operating unit), conducting a hazard assessment, and obtaining specific written approval from 
the manager responsible for the operating unit  
3. that have SSCs important to safety common to more than one unit, tests shall be conducted on 
each unit to provide assurance that the specified performance requirements meet the design 
intent of each unit 
 
Guidance 
If the testing procedure uses SSC test results from offsite tests, this should be defined and 
justified, showing the validity and applicability of performed offsite tests to: 
• 
the onsite physical and functional condition of SSCs important to safety 
• 
their interfaces with the rest of the reactor facility 
 
For some reactor technologies and construction processes, some tests on SSCs important to safety 
performed offsite may need to be considered as part of the commissioning process. In such cases, 
specific justification should be provided showing the validity of the performed tests for the 
current installed conditions of the SSCs important to safety and related functional and physical 
interfaces.  
10.3 
Acceptance criteria 
Acceptance criteria for the commissioning tests, against which the acceptability of the test results 
will be evaluated, shall be defined by the test procedures. 
The technical basis of the acceptance criteria, which is consistent with the safety, design and 
performance requirements, shall be documented in preparation for and prior to conducting the 
tests. 
When using analytical tools, CSA N286.7, Quality Assurance of Analytical, Scientific, and 
Design Computer Programs for Nuclear Power Plants, [10] shall apply. 
Guidance 
CNSC acceptance of the acceptance criteria may be needed before performing the commissioning 
tests.  This will depend on the facility-specific commissioning program. Any criteria requiring 
 
22 
 
 
 
 
January 2016 
REGDOC-2.3.1, Conduct of Licensed Activities: Construction and Commissioning Programs 
 
CNSC acceptance will be identified by the CNSC at the time of review of the overall 
commissioning program and prior to testing. 
Parameters measured during the test should directly relate to, or correlate with, the design 
requirements important to safety while recognizing the safety limits and integrity of the structure, 
system or component. In cases where measured parameters do not directly relate to the 
acceptance criteria, analytical tools may be used to demonstrate that the safety objectives are met.  
Acceptance criteria, especially those directly or indirectly linked to safety, should not change 
during the execution of a test. 
After completion of a test, there may be a discrepancy between the results and acceptance criteria. 
Observed discrepancies and their resolution should be documented; impact assessment of the 
discrepancies on the past and pending tests should also be performed and approvals should be 
secured before proceeding with further tests. 
10.4 
Test procedures 
All commissioning tests shall be performed in accordance with the commissioning program using 
procedures reviewed, verified and approved by the licensee.  
Test procedures shall establish actions for deviations from procedures, where test results fall 
outside the acceptance criteria or if unexpected events occur. Tests shall only resume after any 
existing issue is dispositioned (e.g., through design change, change in operating requirements, or 
change in operating modes,) by the commissioning organization and approved by the relevant 
parties.  
Guidance 
For some tests, the test procedures may require SSCs important to safety to be placed in a 
different configuration than the normal operating configuration. Such deviations or changes may 
involve temporary interlock bypasses, temporary additional interlocks, temporary system 
bypasses, valve configurations and instrument settings. Consideration should be given to 
minimize such arrangements, and to ensure that any deviations from the normal functioning of 
the as-built systems do not invalidate the test objectives. In such instances, the test procedures 
should: 
• 
specify the deviations/changes for the SSCs important to safety from the normal operating 
configurations 
• 
specify back-out provisions and anticipate response to events that could arise from the test  
• 
provide supporting evidence with reference to safety analysis  
• 
include all the necessary steps for the restoration of the SSCs important to safety to their 
normal configuration after the test is completed 
• 
include a list of all necessary checks that are needed to ensure that: 
• 
the deviations/changes are made safely and correctly 
•   the SSCs important to safety are returned to their normal configuration safely and 
correctly 
Test procedures should use normal operating procedures to ease their verification. Where 
improvements to operating procedures are identified during commissioning, commissioning 
 
23 
 
 
 
 
January 2016 
REGDOC-2.3.1, Conduct of Licensed Activities: Construction and Commissioning Programs 
 
personnel should consider, in consultation with the operating organization, amending the 
procedures to permit operating personnel to become familiar with them. Where operating 
procedures have not yet been developed, the operating organization should have processes in 
place to manage commissioning records for use in developing operating procedures. 
The development, verification and validation of commissioning test procedures may benefit from 
the use of validated simulator and computer codes. The use of the facility simulator should be 
considered in training and preparing commissioning teams, particularly for complex 
commissioning tests or for investigating possible adverse conditions that may occur during the 
test. 
The process for preparing test procedures should allow for sufficient time to:  
• 
conduct various levels of review, including responding to potential review requests from the 
CNSC; the design organization should review the procedures – in particular, the validity of 
the acceptance criteria (scope and depth of reviews should be commensurate with the nature 
of the test, regardless of whether a test requires SSCs to be placed in a different configuration 
from the normal operating configuration, and the impact on system safety) 
• 
report test results 
• 
enable review of the test results to proceed safely and efficiently 
Examples of deviations from approved test procedures to be addressed according to the operating 
organization’s control change procedures include:  
• 
a test acceptance criterion that is not met 
• 
inability to demonstrate compliance with the acceptance criterion because of at least one of 
the test conditions not being fulfilled 
• 
the determination of an inadvertent change to the test procedure steps that impacts the 
acceptance criterion  
• 
inability to implement the test completely, as developed in the test procedure 
Should a deviation occur, a review that includes the following should be carried out: 
• 
immediate corrective actions to ensure facility and personnel safety 
• 
safety implications of the deviation 
• 
root-causes of the deviation 
• 
an assessment of whether the deviation prevents continuation of the commissioning activities 
• 
violations of safety and regulatory requirements 
• 
appropriate corrective actions, such as: 
• 
re-performing the test as per procedures 
• 
modifying the design 
• 
updating the safety analysis 
• 
updating/correcting test procedures 
•   updating operational documentation 
The deviation review process should not be finalized until all corrective actions are completed 
and the commissioning procedures are updated and approved. For any deviations requiring a 
 
24 
 
 
 
 
January 2016 
REGDOC-2.3.1, Conduct of Licensed Activities: Construction and Commissioning Programs 
 
design change, the affected test(s) should be repeated to confirm conformance after the design 
change modifications have been implemented.  
For unexpected events, consideration should be given to any fault responses and emergency 
actions required for each test procedure. In some cases it may be the same response to alarms as 
would be necessary for planned operation, whereas other cases may require specific actions 
because of the configuration of the reactor facility during testing. The test procedures should 
identify the specific limits and conditions applicable to the test and the actions to be taken if the 
limits are approached. 
Although the format of procedures may vary from facility to facility, the contents of test 
procedures should include the following: 
• 
Introduction: Summarize the main test objectives and the safety aspects to be demonstrated. 
The system to be tested should be identified and the anticipated test results should be 
indicated. The relationship of the test being carried out to the main phases of the 
commissioning program should be highlighted. 
• 
Test objectives and methods: Set out the objectives of the test and the means by which they 
are to be achieved, including step-by-step actions. 
• 
Limiting criteria: Applicable operational limits and conditions, including temporary ones. 
Limits and conditions that must be adhered to in order to prevent damage to the reactor 
facility should also be included. 
• 
Prerequisites and initial conditions: The state of all relevant SSCs and other pertinent 
conditions that might affect the operation of the system to be tested (including coordinating 
construction, commissioning, operations, verification and validation activities, and hold 
points), particularly if different from normal. This information should include, where 
appropriate, the precautions necessary to maintain the desired system configuration. 
• 
Test conditions and procedures: The way in which the system to be tested is required to be 
brought up to test conditions and details of the test procedures, preferably in a step-by-step 
format. This information should include any temporary changes or abnormal alignments of 
the system or of adjacent systems, and be supported by safety analysis. 
• 
Acceptance criteria: The stated acceptance criteria. Wherever possible, this statement 
should be quantitative as well as qualitative (e.g., for fuel loading). 
• 
List of instrumentation and special test equipment: List all special equipment and 
calibrations necessary to perform the test. The equipment should have appropriate accuracy 
and should be clearly identifiable. 
• 
Staffing, qualification and responsibilities: Staffing needs, qualification requirements and 
assignment of duties and responsibilities for conducting tests, including personnel required to 
oversee and/or witness. 
• 
Special precautions: Measures and actions necessary for the safety of personnel and the 
security of equipment. 
• 
Completion of test: Indication by the responsible personnel that the test has been completed 
and the systems have been returned to normal conditions. The removal of temporary changes 
or of any abnormal lineup should be individually specified (i.e., as steps in the test 
procedure). 
• 
Permanent records: Information necessary for permanent records, including baseline data. 
• 
Identification, cross-referencing and distribution: a unique identification system (such as 
one using reference numbering), including comprehensive cross-references to associated 
documents and a distribution list of those persons who should receive it. 
 
25 
 
 
 
 
January 2016 
REGDOC-2.3.1, Conduct of Licensed Activities: Construction and Commissioning Programs 
 
• 
Data collection and processing: Make arrangements for tabulating data and test results. Test 
sheets should have standardized forms and each sheet should be signed by the data collector. 
Chronological recording is desirable (test data, date and time). Data pre-processing by the 
data acquisition system and post-processing, if any, should be validated and verified. 
• 
Non-conformities: Make arrangements to manage any non-conformities identified as a result 
of the tests. 
• 
Provisions for the techniques and methods of data analysis, including the analysis of 
measurement results: Verify and validate the software used for data collection, storage and 
analysis prior to the test. The repeatability, accuracy and measurement uncertainty should be 
documented. 
10.5 
Review, evaluation and reporting of test results 
Test results shall be reviewed by the commissioning organization to ensure that all deviations are 
resolved and that operating constraints, if any, are identified and documented.  
Interpretation of test data shall be reviewed by persons who have the technical expertise to 
determine that the operational characteristics of the structure, system or component and/or 
process are captured. 
Formal reports for each test shall be prepared by individuals responsible for the tests, and 
approved by the commissioning and design organizations. 
The reactor facility design, operational and safety documentation shall be updated to reflect test 
results and resolution of deviations. 
If test results indicate that a change to the scope of subsequent tests is required, a documented 
assessment shall be performed prior to proceeding with the remaining tests to ensure that:  
1. the proposed changes do not fall outside the range of assumptions made in the safety analysis 
and do not invalidate the licensing basis 
2. the proposed changes do not invalidate the results of the previous tests 
3. the proposed changes do not adversely impact future tests in terms of scope, objectives and 
sequence 
4. the commissioning documents are updated with the nature of, and justification for, the 
proposed changes as per management system requirements 
 
 
The commissioning organization shall report the test results to the operating organization and to 
other participants in the commissioning program, as required.  
Guidance 
Although it may be expedient to prepare summary reports as an interim measure for a quick 
assessment of the test results, a formal comprehensive report that includes a final evaluation of 
the test results should be prepared. 
The format of a report may vary, but should typically include: 
• 
an introduction, which includes a summary of test objectives with evidence of safety 
objectives, a description of the test method and acceptance criteria 
 
26 
 
 
 
 
January 2016 
REGDOC-2.3.1, Conduct of Licensed Activities: Construction and Commissioning Programs 
 
• 
references to appropriate test procedures 
• 
the conduct of the test, including the duration, the initial and final states of the reactor facility, 
the actual limitations experienced and the problems encountered and actions taken to 
overcome them (including modifications to the facility or procedures) 
• 
a concise description of any special test equipment used 
• 
a summary of data collected and analysis of the data 
• 
an evaluation of results, including both qualitative observations (e.g., visual observations) and 
a comparison of applicable test data with the acceptance criteria 
• 
conclusions regarding system or component adequacy 
• 
deficiencies relating to design and construction found during conduct of the tests, as well as 
system modifications and corrective actions required to correct these deficiencies  
• 
cross-references and a distribution list 
 
Formal reports may serve as valid test/phase completion certificates, as long as they contain all 
the required information. In addition to individual test reports, phase test reports and a final 
station commissioning report should be prepared. 
The licensee should establish clear objectives for the state of design, operational and safety 
documentation at the time of turnover to operations. Documentation should be updated in a 
timely manner to reflect test results and resolution of deviations, in order to minimize the risk of 
human error. The CNSC will monitor the status of documentation as a part of ongoing 
compliance verification. 
10.6 
Modifications  
Modifications to test procedures and other related documents shall be authorized by means of a 
formal licensee-approved process to control changes in documentation. 
For modifications to the sequence of a test within a hold point or across hold points, reviews shall 
be performed and approvals obtained from the appropriate organizations. The reviews shall 
ensure that prerequisites for the out-of-sequence test are met in order to ensure the test is 
performed safely. 
Temporary modifications to an approved design configuration for the purposes of commissioning 
testing shall be controlled by the commissioning organization, with licensee oversight. A review 
shall be performed to ensure that safety implications are considered. 
Guidance 
Modifications to the test sequence may be made because of: 
• 
changes in external conditions (e.g., availability of the grid) 
• 
progress in other tests  
• 
status of periodic tests or maintenance activities 
Proposals for design modifications to address a deviation should consider regulatory requirements 
and the stipulations of the operating organization, including the impact on other systems as well 
as safety implications for the commissioning program or individual tests.

11. 
Testing Phases  
Tests shall be performed in phases and in a logical progressive sequence. There shall be a 
minimum of four phases: 
1. Phase A: prior to fuel load  
2. Phase B: prior to leaving reactor guaranteed shutdown state 
3. Phase C: approach to critical and low-power tests  
4. Phase D: high-power tests  
Before proceeding to the next phase, it shall be confirmed that all prerequisites established 
between the licensee and the CNSC necessary for proceeding beyond the current phase are met. 
Before transitioning from one phase of the commissioning process to the subsequent phase, the 
licensee shall assure that SSCs credited in the safety case for that phase have been installed and 
confirmed to the extent practicable to meet their designed safety function.   
The CNSC may choose to witness some commissioning tests. In such cases, the licensee shall 
inform the CNSC so that staff can attend. 
Guidance 
Testing of a specific structure, system or component may require changes to the reactor facility 
configuration and modes of operation. Such testing may also place demands on appropriate 
functioning of other SSCs and the availability of various safety functions. Therefore, the 
sequence of testing is important to the overall safety of the reactor facility.  
Tests should be planned in chronological order. Before nuclear material is brought onsite, 
applicable security systems should be commissioned and operational. Safety systems and 
safety-related systems (e.g., fire protection system, radiation protection system, emergency power 
system) should be operational before other systems are tested, for the protection of personnel, 
public and the environment, and facility or nuclear safety. Tasks necessary for the preparation of 
the next sequence of tests, in particular the availability requirements of the systems that are 
necessary, should be identified. Relevant safety system(s) and alarm settings, including those of 
radiological protection instruments, should be specified at appropriate stages during 
commissioning. 
A system/component-level functional dependency matrix (within a system, across systems, at 
system interfaces, and across units for multi-unit sites) may help identify and plan the chronology 
and sequence of tests. Some tests across systems may need to be grouped and performed at the 
same time to ensure appropriate interfacing of such systems. Support systems (e.g., compressed 
air system, electrical system, service water system, demineralized water supply system) should be 
tested prior to the testing of other systems that depend on their availability. 
Within the overall fuel-out (phase A) or fuel-in (phase B and up) (see sections 11.1 and 11.2, 
respectively) commissioning program, activities are usually further divided into cold and hot 
performance tests. 
Cold performance tests are thermal hydraulic tests under cold conditions and involve:  
• 
pressure and pressure drop  
 
28 
 
 
 
 
January 2016 
REGDOC-2.3.1, Conduct of Licensed Activities: Construction and Commissioning Programs 
 
• 
flow  
• 
pump-head/pump-flow characteristics 
• 
equipment and instrument performance tests of the nuclear steam plant and balance of plant 
Cold performance testing includes the initial starting of fluid and support systems. The objectives 
of these tests are to obtain initial operational data on equipment, determine operational 
compatibility with interfacing systems, and verify the functional performance of these systems. 
Hot performance tests are thermal hydraulic tests under hot conditions and involve: 
• 
pressure, and pressure drop  
• 
flow 
• 
equipment and instrument performance tests of the primary and secondary side systems 
Hot performance testing should be undertaken to verify the conformance of systems with 
specified requirements. Where possible, these tests should follow cold performance tests under 
operating conditions that simulate typical temperatures, pressures and flow rates for anticipated 
operational occurrences (AOOs) and design-basis accidents (DBAs).  
The tests should verify the effectiveness of heat insulation and heat removal systems. Initial flow 
rates, pump-head/pump-flow characteristics, pressure drop and temperature measurements at 
various locations around the reactor facility should be checked and confirmed against design 
calculations. The vibration levels, clearances and other provisions that were made to 
accommodate thermal expansion of SSCs should be checked and confirmed. 
Phases are imposed to ensure proper assessment of available commissioning results against pre-
defined acceptance criteria. Licensees may incorporate as many phases or hold points as they see 
fit. Depending on the situation, the CNSC may request regulatory hold points. The selection of 
regulatory hold points will generally be agreed upon between the licensee and the CNSC and 
incorporated into the licence. 
For each phase, the test results and the general condition of the reactor facility should be 
reviewed and approved by the commissioning and operating organizations. It is recommended 
that the licensee develop detailed matrices of the prerequisites to be formally demonstrated for 
each phase and hold point within the phase. These matrices should be developed in agreement 
with all stakeholders. 
The following steps should be undertaken at the end of each phase: 
• 
documents to certify the performance of tests and provide phase clearances for the 
continuation of the commissioning program should be prepared and issued 
• 
test certificates should be issued by the commissioning organization to certify that the tests 
have been completed in accordance with authorized procedures, stating any reservations 
about departures from or limitations of the procedures 
• 
phase completion certificates should be issued by the commissioning organization to certify 
that all the tests in the respective commissioning phase have been satisfactorily completed 
(listing all deficiencies and non-conformances, if any); phase completion certificates should 
also list associated test certificates 
• 
it should be ensured that succeeding phases can be conducted safely and that the safety of the 
reactor facility is never dependent on the performance of untested SSCs 
 
29 
 
 
 
 
January 2016 
REGDOC-2.3.1, Conduct of Licensed Activities: Construction and Commissioning Programs 
 
The written request to the CNSC for approval to proceed beyond a commissioning phase should 
confirm that: 
• 
all related project commitments tied to the phase have been completed 
• 
all systems required for safe operation beyond the phase are available 
• 
all specified operating procedures have been formally verified and validated 
• 
specified training has been completed and staff are qualified 
• 
all non-conformances and unexpected results identified leading up to the next phase have 
been addressed 
11.1 
Phase A: prior to fuel load  
Before fuel is loaded into the core, the operability, availability and performance of the SSCs that 
will ensure safety with fuel in the core shall be tested, and appropriate tests of fuel handling 
equipment shall be completed. 
Guidance 
Satisfactory pre-operational tests (see appendix A for recommended tests) should take into 
account the proper sequence of tests of electrical systems, instrumentation systems and other 
service systems (such as cooling water and fire protection systems). This is to ensure the 
availability of the services required to implement the entire commissioning program. Special 
instrumentation and control required for the first fuel load and start-up should be installed and 
checked during this phase. 
During this phase, operations personnel should take the opportunity to use, verify and validate 
operating procedures.  
Some critical elements of heat sinks (flow rates, pressures, etc.) may be tested with fuel imitators 
in the core. These tests provide early assurances that safety will be maintained once fuel is 
loaded. Typically, testing of these systems will continue after fuel load. 
Emergency management arrangements should be in place and tested before the commencement of 
fuel loading begins and take into account the fact that non-nuclear hazards, such as fire, could 
arise while the nuclear fuel is on the site. 
11.2 
Phase B: prior to leaving reactor guaranteed shutdown state  
This phase focuses on ensuring the fuel is loaded into the reactor safely, and on confirming that 
the reactor is in a suitable condition to be started up and that all prerequisites for permitting the 
reactor to go critical have been met. This phase shall be successfully completed before 
approaching criticality. 
During this phase: 
1. the reactivity control mechanism shall be available and in service and the reactor shall be 
maintained subcritical at all times 
2. availability of the automatic shutdown systems shall be confirmed  
3. the availability of the reactor trip system against neutronic and process-related upsets shall be 
confirmed 
 
30 
 
 
 
 
January 2016 
REGDOC-2.3.1, Conduct of Licensed Activities: Construction and Commissioning Programs 
 
4. subcriticality checks shall be performed at regular steps during fuel loading to determine safe 
loading increments for subsequent loading 
5. predictions of the behaviour of the core in terms of its reactivity shall be available for the 
evaluation of subcriticality margin  
6. acceptance criteria for the maximum permissible deviation of predicted values from 
measurements shall be defined  
7. tests on coolant flow, pressure, temperature and the performance of associated 
instrumentation and control mechanisms shall be conducted 
8. fuel loading shall be supervised by certified personnel from the operating organization 
Guidance 
This phase involves initial fuel loading and subcriticality tests (see appendix B for recommended 
tests). 
The processes for loading fuel must provide assurance that fuel and structures are not damaged in 
the process of fuel load and that the nuclear material in the core is in the specific configuration 
established by design. For applicable reactor designs, the core should be fuelled in accordance 
with a predetermined loading pattern. Fuel loading procedures should include, as appropriate:  
• 
periodic data recording 
• 
audible indication of flux increase 
• 
monitoring of neutron count rate when reactivity is being inserted or removed and during any 
other operations that could potentially affect core reactivity 
Availability of the shutdown systems should be assured before a reactor state is entered that may 
require the system to actuate to prevent damage to the fuel and/or the facility. Where full testing 
of the functional part of the system and credited trips is not possible before entering a specific 
reactor state, the gap in assurance normally provided by a full testing program should be 
compensated by other means such as partial testing, wire by wire checking, additional analysis 
and modelling additional verification. Testing to fill the gaps should be scheduled at the first 
opportunity when plant systems enable conditions to allow testing. 
Any changes occurring in the reactor should be reported immediately to the control room 
personnel. Fuel loading should be stopped if measurements deviate from predicted values and 
commence only after the root causes are determined and appropriate corrective actions are taken. 
If required by the safety analysis, the position of each core element should be independently 
confirmed and documented. 
11.3 
Phase C: approach to critical and low-power tests  
This phase focuses on confirming reactor behaviour at the stage of initial criticality and 
subsequent low-power tests. It includes activities that cannot be performed with the reactor held 
in a subcritical state (shutdown state). 
During this phase: 
1. trip set points shall be verified to ensure that they are compatible with the demands of the 
tests scheduled in this phase 
2. the availability of the automatic shutdown systems shall be confirmed for low-power 
shutdown 
 
31 
 
 
 
 
January 2016 
REGDOC-2.3.1, Conduct of Licensed Activities: Construction and Commissioning Programs 
 
3. radiological surveys and functional tests of radiation protection equipment shall be made 
4. changes in reactivity shall be continuously monitored and evaluated so that the prediction of 
the point of criticality is continually checked 
5. the sequence and magnitude of the reactivity changes shall be performed in accordance with 
defined procedures 
6. the performance of the reactor core shall be commensurate with design assumptions and 
predictions, and comply fully with the safety analysis report 
7. it shall be confirmed that the reactor core is in proper condition to operate at higher power 
levels 
8. characteristics of the reactivity control systems and shielding shall be commensurate with 
design assumptions and predictions, and shall comply fully with the safety analysis report 
9. integrated system validation shall be completed if it has not been conducted during earlier 
phases of commissioning 
Guidance 
During this phase, criticality of the fuel in the reactor core is achieved for the first time (see 
appendix C for recommended tests). The power levels of this phase will be the lowest that give 
reliable and stable measurements and that enable the required conditions to perform the specified 
tests. Special very-low-power (start-up) instrumentation may be used if necessary and may need 
to be connected into the shutdown logic where trip coverage is not available from the normal 
shutdown means (detectors out of range). 
Reactivity changes are controlled using reactivity devices such as mechanical control rods (and 
rods of other types), adjustable reflectors, liquid poison, and adjustment of process fluids such as 
coolant flow, liquid zone controls or moderator level. In these tests, reactor trip set points for 
different shutdown means should be set to conservative values. 
Achieving criticality requires a cautious approach and continuous monitoring of the neutron flux. 
After the subcritical multiplication factor has been determined, predictions for the point of 
criticality should be performed while making smaller, successive adjustments to positive 
reactivity. The objective of these actions is to avoid passing through the point of criticality with a 
high rate of change in neutron flux (short period of multiplication). After criticality has been 
achieved, a conservative start-up rate of flux increase should be used in attaining low power. 
11.4 
Phase D: high-power tests  
This phase focuses on demonstrating reactor and systems behaviour at higher power levels, 
including activities that could not be carried out at the power levels in Phase C. 
During this phase: 
1. high-power tests shall be performed at various bulk power intervals, and these intervals shall 
be approved by the CNSC  
2. in accordance with the design, tests shall be made to demonstrate that the reactor facility is 
able to: 
a. safely operate at steady state under normal operating conditions 
b. mitigate or prevent AOOs escalating to more severe events  
c. safely cope with DBAs (note that the facility need not be put into a DBA 
condition, but rather the function of mitigating systems verified) 
 
32 
 
 
 
 
January 2016 
REGDOC-2.3.1, Conduct of Licensed Activities: Construction and Commissioning Programs 
 
3. a documented review shall be carried out at the end of each high-power test to confirm that 
the operational limits and conditions are adequate and practicable and identify any constraints 
on the operation of the reactor facility 
Guidance 
This phase should generally be limited to those tests that can only be carried out at high power 
(see appendix D for recommended tests). 
This phase of commissioning tests consists of incremental approach to full power. A 
comprehensive range of power tests should be made to confirm that the reactor facility can be 
operated in accordance with the design intent and that the reactor facility can continue to operate 
safely. Typically, power is increased in increments until full power is reached. At each increment, 
a series of prerequisite tests are performed that must be met before proceeding to the next power 
level. The CNSC may stipulate more than one regulatory hold point as power increases, based on 
the specifics of the testing program and the relevance to demonstrating the safe operation of the 
facility. 
During testing, in order to minimize time at risk, tests that are necessary to demonstrate safe 
operability should be completed without delay.  
12. 
Transfer of Structures, Systems and Components and the Reactor Facility 
Appropriate procedures shall be in place for the transfer and ownership of SSCs and the reactor 
facility from the construction organization and non-licensee commissioning staff to the licensee’s 
operating organization. These procedures shall describe the detailed process steps, including 
responsibilities and authorities of the parties involved. 
Prior to fuel-in-core testing, all SSCs important to safety shall be under the control of the 
operating organization. 
Before the transfer takes place, representatives of the organizations involved in the turnover 
process shall carry out facility walk downs of all systems.   
The licensee shall maintain responsibility for safety and security at all times during the transfer. 
The transfer of SSCs shall be documented. All commissioning records shall be turned over to the 
operating organization’s records-management program and retained for the life of the reactor 
facility.  
Guidance 
Turnover includes the transfer of SSCs and documentation, and may also include the transfer of 
personnel. The transfer of documentation (paper and electronic) is a key feature in the turnover 
process. Documentation should be transferred in system packages and over a reasonable period of 
time, to enable reactor facility personnel to perform a comprehensive review of every package. 
Document transfers should also depend on how responsibilities for testing after fuel loading, at 
initial criticality, at low power and at power escalation are assigned.

and reliability of the safety assessment and the assumptions made therein. 
small reactor 
A reactor with a power level of less than approximately 200 megawatts thermal that is used for research, 
isotope production, steam generation, electricity production or other applications. 
structures, systems and components (SSCs)  
A general term encompassing all of the elements of a facility or activity that contribute to protection and 
safety. Structures are the passive elements: buildings, vessels, shielding, etc. A system comprises several 
components, assembled in such a way as to perform a specific (active) function. A component is a 
discrete element of a system. Some examples are wires, transistors, integrated circuits, motors, relays, 
solenoids, pipes, fittings, pumps, tanks and valves. 
structures, systems and components important to safety 
Structures, systems and components of the nuclear power plant associated with the initiation, prevention, 
detection or mitigation of any failure sequence and that have an impact in reducing the possibility of 
damage to fuel, associated release of radionuclides or both.
