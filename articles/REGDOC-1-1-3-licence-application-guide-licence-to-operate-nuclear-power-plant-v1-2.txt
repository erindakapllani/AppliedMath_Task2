Preface 
This regulatory document is part of the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC)’s reactor facilities 
series of regulatory documents, which also covers licence application guides for nuclear power plant 
(NPP) licences for other lifecycle stages. The full list of regulatory document series is included at the end 
of this document and can also be found on the CNSC’s website. 
Regulatory document REGDOC-1.1.3, Licence Application Guide: Licence to Operate a Nuclear Power 
Plant sets out requirements and guidance on submitting a formal application to the CNSC to obtain a 
licence to operate an NPP in Canada, and identifies the information that should be included in the 
application. 
This document will be used to assess licence applications for proposed new NPPs and for licence 
renewals for existing NPPs. Once the Commission has granted a licence, the safety and control measures 
described in the licence application and the documents needed to support the application will form part of 
the licensing basis. 
Guidance contained in this document exists to inform the applicant, to elaborate further on requirements 
or to provide direction to licensees and applicants on how to meet requirements. It also provides more 
information about how CNSC staff evaluate the information during their review of licence applications. 
Licensees are expected to review and consider guidance; should they choose not to follow it, they should 
explain how their chosen alternate approach meets regulatory requirements. An applicant or licensee may 
put forward a case to demonstrate that the intent of a specification is addressed by other means and 
demonstrated by supporting information. 
A graded approach, commensurate with risk, may be defined and used when applying the requirements 
and guidance contained in this regulatory document. The use of a graded approach is not a relaxation of 
requirements. With a graded approach, the application of requirements is commensurate with the risks 
and particular characteristics of the facility or activity. 
Version 1.2 includes administrative updates to reflect the latest changes made to the CNSC’s Safety and 
Control Area Framework. 
Important note: Where referenced in a licence either directly or indirectly (such as through licensee-
referenced documents), this document is part of the licensing basis for a regulated facility or activity.  
The licensing basis sets the boundary conditions for acceptable performance at a regulated facility or 
activity and establishes the basis for the CNSC’s compliance program for that regulated facility or 
activity.  
Where this document is part of the licensing basis, the word “shall” is used to express a requirement to 
be satisfied by the licensee or licence applicant. “Should” is used to express guidance or that which is 
advised. “May” is used to express an option or that which is advised or permissible within the limits of 
this regulatory document. “Can” is used to express possibility or capability. 
Nothing contained in this document is to be construed as relieving any licensee from any other 
pertinent requirements. It is the licensee’s responsibility to identify and comply with all applicable 
regulations and licence conditions.

By following the information in this regulatory document, applicants will submit the appropriate 
information to demonstrate that they are qualified and will make adequate and reasonable provisions to 
undertake the activity to be licensed. 
The information in this document is consistent with modern national and international practices 
addressing issues and elements that control and enhance nuclear safety. In particular, they establish a 
modern, risk-informed approach to the licensing of nuclear power plants.

Licence Application Guide: Licence to Operate a Nuclear Power Plant 
1. 
Introduction 
1.1 
Purpose 
This licence application guide identifies the information to be provided in support of an 
application for a licence to operate a nuclear power plant (NPP). It sets out requirements and 
guidance on submitting a formal application to the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC) 
to obtain a licence. 
By following the information in this regulatory document, applicants will submit the appropriate 
information to demonstrate that they are qualified and will make adequate provisions to undertake 
the activity to be licensed. 
1.2 
Scope 
This document will be used: 
• 
by applicants to prepare a licence application for a licence to operate a proposed new NPP or 
for the renewal of a licence to operate an existing facility 
• 
by CNSC staff to assess the licence application  
Note 1: This document is not intended for applications for a licence amendment or revocation of 
an operating licence. 
Note 2: The applicant must possess a licence to operate a nuclear facility before operation 
commences. For a new nuclear facility, operation commences when fuel is loaded (i.e., no fuel 
may be loaded before the licence to operate has been granted by the CNSC). 
1.3 
Relevant legislation 
The following provisions of the Nuclear Safety and Control Act (NSCA, the Act) and the 
regulations made under it are relevant to this document: 
• 
subsection 24(4) of the NSCA states that “No licence shall be issued, renewed, amended or 
replaced – and no authorization to transfer one given – unless, in the opinion of the 
Commission, the applicant or, in the case of an application for an authorization to transfer the 
licence, the transferee 
(a) is qualified to carry on the activity that the licence will authorize the licensee to carry on; 
and 
(b) will, in carrying on that activity, make adequate provision for the protection of the 
environment, the health and safety of persons and the maintenance of national security and 
measures required to implement international obligations to which Canada has agreed.” 
• 
paragraphs (a) and (e) of section 26 of the NSCA state that “Subject to the regulations, no 
person shall, except in accordance with a licence, 
(a) possess, transfer, import, export, use or abandon a nuclear substance, prescribed 
equipment or prescribed information 
[…] 
(e) prepare a site for, construct, operate, modify, decommission or abandon a nuclear facility” 
July 2022  
REGDOC-1.1.3, Licence Application Guide: Licence to Operate a Nuclear Power Plant

• 
subsection 3(1.1) of the General Nuclear Safety and Control Regulations (GNSCR) states 
that “the Commission or a designated officer authorized under paragraph 37(2)(c) of the Act, 
may require any other information that is necessary to enable the Commission or the 
designated officer to determine whether the applicant 
(a) is qualified to carry on the activity to be licensed; or 
(b) will, in carrying on that activity, make adequate provision for the protection of the 
environment, the health and safety of persons and the maintenance of national security and 
measures required to implement international obligations to which Canada has agreed.” 
Other relevant sections of the regulations made under the NSCA are included in the content of 
this document. Appendix A maps a list of relevant clauses from the NSCA and the regulations 
made under the NSCA to the related sections of this licence application guide. 
The applicant must also comply with all applicable laws and regulations at all jurisdictional 
levels, provided they do not conflict with the NSCA and the regulations made under the NSCA.  
Note: This regulatory document includes select requirements that are based on the NSCA and the 
regulations made under the NSCA. Other requirements are related to documents that must be 
addressed so that they are incorporated into the licensing basis, and that existing practice for 
licence renewals is codified. 
1.4 
CNSC contact information 
A single point of contact from the CNSC is assigned to work with every licensee or applicant. 
This point of contact can provide the licensee or applicant with additional information or 
explanation of the information contained within this document. 
The applicant should contact the CNSC early in the licence application process, and request the 
name and contact information of the single point of contact assigned to the licence application. 
To contact the CNSC, refer to the CNSC’s website.

2. 
Licensing Basis, Process and Submission 
This section provides information on the licensing basis and process, including completing and 
submitting the licence application. 
2.1 
Licensing basis 
The licensing basis sets the boundary conditions for acceptable performance at a nuclear facility. 
It establishes the basis for the CNSC’s compliance program, which is designed to ensure that the 
licensee continues to meet requirements and conduct the licensed activity within the licensing 
basis. The concept of the licensing basis is explained in the CNSC’s information document 
Licensing Basis Objective and Definition [1]. 
The applicant shall notify CNSC staff of any conflicts between elements of the licensing basis for 
the proposed licence (for example, conflicts between provincial and federal legislation). 
CNSC staff will review the application and the supporting documentation, and assess whether the 
information is acceptable. When the Commission grants a licence, the information describing the 
safety and control measures will form part of the licensing basis. 
2.2 
Licensing process 
REGDOC-3.5.1, Licensing Process for Class I Nuclear Facilities and Uranium Mines and 
Mills [2], clarifies the licensing process in the context of the NSCA.  
In addition to the information provided in this licence application guide (REGDOC-1.1.3), the 
CNSC may request additional information by sending supplemental, facility-specific guidance to 
the applicant prior to the beginning of the licensing process. 
The licensing process is initiated when the applicant submits a licence application. When 
necessary for increased clarity, the CNSC may request additional information, even if the 
application generally conforms to the guidelines provided in this document. Applicants should 
ensure they have included sufficiently detailed information to allow the licensing process to 
proceed efficiently; early engagement with CNSC staff is encouraged. 
Note: The information provided in this document does not prevent applicants from proposing 
alternatives. However, any proposed alternative should appropriately reflect the complexities and 
hazards of the proposed activities, and should be demonstrated by supporting information.  
2.3 
Structuring the licence application 
The application may be completed in either of Canada’s official languages (English or French).

This licence application guide describes the expected safety and control measures, organized by 
the CNSC’s safety and control area (SCA) framework. The CNSC uses (SCAs as the technical 
topics to assess, review, verify and report on regulatory requirements and performance across all 
regulated facilities and activities, as follows (see appendix B): 
• 
management system 
• 
human performance management 
• 
operating performance 
• 
safety analysis 
• 
physical design 
• 
fitness for service 
• 
radiation protection 
• 
conventional health and safety 
• 
environmental protection 
• 
emergency management and fire protection 
• 
waste management 
• 
security 
• 
safeguards and non-proliferation 
• 
packaging and transport 
Each of the 14 SCAs is further divided into specific areas that cover all of the topics addressed in 
a complete assessment and review. 
The applicant may choose to organize the information in any structure. However, the applicant is 
encouraged to organize the licence application according to the CNSC’s SCA framework so as to 
facilitate the CNSC’s review. If the application does not follow the order and organization of 
SCAs as shown above, the applicant should map the application to the CNSC’s SCA framework. 
2.4 
Completing the licence application 
The applicant is responsible for ensuring that the licence application contains sufficient 
information to meet regulatory requirements and to demonstrate that the applicant is qualified to 
carry on the licensed activity and will make adequate provisions to protect the health, safety and 
security of persons and the environment. If some information requested in various sections is 
redundant, the applicant may provide cross-references to detailed information in other sections as 
appropriate. 
The application should cite CNSC regulatory documents, and other codes and standards that will 
govern program objectives that demonstrate the applicant’s ability to meet the safety and control 
measures. Appendix C provides three lists of documents: 
• 
all applicants shall apply as requirements the documents listed in table C.1 
• 
new applicants shall apply as requirements the documents listed in table C.2; for licence 
renewals at existing NPPs, applicants shall address them to the extent practicable 
• 
all applicants should address as guidance the documents listed in table C.3 
Early in the licensing process, the CNSC will provide the applicant with the appropriate version 
(publication date and revision number) of each document to be cited through supplemental 
guidance. The supplemental guidance may also indicate documents additional to the ones listed in 
appendix C that the applicant should consider and address in the application.

The applicant may provide references to any documents that were previously provided in 
applications for a licence for site preparation or construction. For the renewal of an existing 
licence, the applicant will have already submitted the majority of the information with previous 
licence applications. This application should provide a list of the supporting documents and 
clearly identify which information has already been submitted. The supporting documents 
describe the safety policies, programs, processes, procedures, and other safety and control 
measures. Appendix D provides a sample format for applicants to map their supporting 
documents to the SCA framework, as well as to indicate if the document has already been 
submitted to the CNSC (for example, as part of a previous licence application). Note: If the 
document version in the supporting information has changed, the applicant must provide the 
CNSC with the new version number and a revised copy of the document. 
The application should indicate the relevant sections of each supporting document.  
New licence applications 
For new licence applications, the applicant should confirm which editions of the codes and 
standards have received regulatory acceptance prior to the development of safety policies, 
programs, processes, procedures and other safety and control measures. 
Licence renewals 
For the renewal of an existing licence, the licensee typically conducts a periodic safety review 
(PSR). A PSR is used to determine the extent to which an existing NPP conforms to applicable 
regulatory requirements and to modern codes, standards and practices, and to identify any factors 
that would limit safe long-term operation. In performing a PSR, the licensee is required to 
conduct comprehensive reviews, addressing all aspects of safety, in order to conduct a global 
assessment and develop an integrated implementation plan (IIP) that describes safety 
improvements to be carried out by the licensee during the next licence period. For additional 
information on conducting a PSR, refer to REGDOC-2.3.3, Periodic Safety Reviews [3]. 
For licence renewals at existing NPPs: 
• 
The applicant should indicate the editions of the codes and standards that form part of the 
application. The information may be informed by the list of documents that formed the basis 
of a PSR, but the two lists will not necessarily be identical. The applicant should use these 
documents in a manner that is consistent with the results of the safety factor reports in the 
PSR. 
• 
The applicant shall submit improvement plans and significant activities to be carried out 
during the proposed licence period. These improvements include activities to be carried out 
during special outages (such as refurbishment outages), programmatic changes and major 
hardware modifications, replacements or repairs. Where changes are planned for the purposes 
of meeting new standards or practices (for example, changes related to the implementation of 
new documents listed in table C.2), the applicant shall identify the standard to be met and 
provide an implementation plan that includes target dates for compliance. An IIP derived 
from a PSR provides much of the necessary information.

past performance under each SCA; for the SCAs covered by the PSR, this information 
may come from the safety factor report for safety factor 8 (safety performance) 
• 
significant findings that affect or have previously affected the conduct of licensed 
activities 
• 
significant lessons learned from operating experience (OPEX); for the SCAs covered by 
the PSR, this information may come from the safety factor report for safety factors 8 
(safety performance) and 9 (use of experience from other plants and research findings) 
• 
significant changes to operational states (for example, return to service from 
refurbishment, changes to output, units entering or leaving prolonged layup) 
• 
results from major self-assessments; for example, the global assessment from a PSR or 
any functional area review (such as a management system review or OPEX effectiveness 
review), including strengths and areas for improvements 
• 
how the applicant: 
• 
has addressed any follow-up actions from any environmental assessments (EAs) 
conducted during the current licensing period 
• 
will address any ongoing or outstanding follow-up actions 
• 
The applicant should describe any additional planned changes that may affect the applicant’s 
ability to carry on the licensed activities (for example, significant organizational or 
management changes).
