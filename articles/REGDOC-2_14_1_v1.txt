February 2016.  
Canada’s PTNSR 2015 provide requirements for licences to transport nuclear substances, for transporting 
nuclear substances and for record keeping. These regulations also include requirements for the design and 
certification of packages, special form radioactive material and other prescribed equipment. Requirements 
under the PTNSR 2015 apply to all persons – including nuclear facilities and CNSC licensees and 
applicants – who are transporting nuclear substances or offering them for transport. 
The PTNSR 2015 primarily address public health, safety and security, and protection of the environment 
related to the special characteristics of radioactive material. The CNSC and Transport Canada are jointly 
responsible for ensuring the safe transport of nuclear substances in Canada. Transport Canada’s 
Transportation of Dangerous Goods Regulations deal with the transport of all classes of dangerous 
goods.

Introduction 
1.1 
Purpose 
Canada’s Packaging and Transport of Nuclear Substances Regulations, 2015 (PTNSR 2015) are based on the 
regulations established by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA): SSR-6, Regulations for the Safe

See Table 2, column 4 of the IAEA Regulations. 
 
DETERMINATION OF BASIC RADIONUCLIDE VALUES 
Paragraph 403. For individual radionuclides: 
(a) That are not listed in Table 2, the determination of the basic 
radionuclide values referred to in para. 402 shall require multilateral 
approval. For these radionuclides, activity concentrations for exempt 
material and activity limits for exempt consignments shall be calculated 
in accordance with the principles established in the GSR Part 3 [7]. It is 
permissible to use an A2 value calculated using a dose coefficient for 
the appropriate lung absorption type, as recommended by the 
International Commission on Radiological Protection, if the chemical 
forms of each radionuclide under both normal and accident conditions of 
transport are taken into consideration. Alternatively, the radionuclide 
values in Table 3 may be used without obtaining competent authority 
approval.

basic radionuclide values to those in Table 2 for the activity limit for an 
exempt consignment are permitted and shall require multilateral 
approval. Such alternative activity limits for an exempt consignment 
shall be calculated in accordance with the principles set out in the GSR 
Part 3 [7]. 
Paragraph 405. For mixtures of radionuclides, the basic radionuclide 
values referred to in para. 402 may be determined as follows: 
Xm   =

∑ 
 i 
f (i) 
X (i) 
where 
f (i) is the fraction of activity or activity concentration of radionuclide i in 
the mixture. 
X (i) is the appropriate value of A1 or A2, or the activity concentration 
limit for exempt material or the activity limit for an exempt consignment 
as appropriate for radionuclide i. 
Xm is the derived value of A1 or A2, or the activity concentration limit for 
exempt material or the activity limit for an exempt consignment in the 
case of a mixture. 
Paragraph 406. When the identity of each radionuclide is known but the 
individual activities of some of the radionuclides are not known, the 
radionuclides may be grouped and the lowest radionuclide value, as 
appropriate for the radionuclides in each group, may be used in applying 
the formulas in paras 405 and 430. Groups may be based on the total 
alpha activity and the total beta/gamma activity when these are known, 
using the lowest radionuclide values for the alpha emitters or beta/gamma 
emitters, respectively. 
Paragraph 407. For individual radionuclides or for mixtures of 
radionuclides for which relevant data are not available, the values shown 
in Table 3 shall be used.

listed in those Regulations. 
BASIC RADIONUCLIDE VALUES 
Paragraph 402. The following basic values for individual radionuclides are 
given in Table 2: 
(a) A1 and A2 in TBq; 
(b) Activity concentration limits for exempt material in Bq/g; 
(c) Activity limits for exempt consignments in Bq. 
DETERMINATION OF BASIC RADIONUCLIDE VALUES 
Paragraph 403. For individual radionuclides: 
(a) That are not listed in Table 2, the determination of the basic 
radionuclide values referred to in para. 402 shall require multilateral 
approval. For these radionuclides, activity concentrations for exempt 
material and activity limits for exempt consignments shall be calculated 
in accordance with the principles established in GSR Part 3 [7]. It is 
permissible to use an A2 value calculated using a dose coefficient for 
the appropriate lung absorption type, as recommended by the 
International Commission on Radiological Protection, if the chemical 
forms of each radionuclide under both normal and accident conditions of 
transport are taken into consideration. Alternatively, the radionuclide 
values in Table 3 may be used without obtaining competent authority 
approval. 
(b) In instruments or articles in which the radioactive material is 
enclosed in or is included as a component part of the instrument or 
other manufactured article and which meets para. 423(c), alternative 
basic radionuclide values to those in Table 2 for the activity limit for an 
exempt consignment are permitted and shall require multilateral 
approval. Such alternative activity limits for an exempt consignment 
shall be calculated in accordance with the principles set out in GSR Part 
3 [7]. 
Paragraph 404. In the calculations of A1 and A2 for a radionuclide not 
listed in Table 2, a single radioactive decay chain in which the 
radionuclides are present in their naturally occurring proportions, and in 
which no daughter nuclide has a half-life either longer than 10 days or 
longer than that of the parent nuclide, shall be considered as a single 
radionuclide; and the activity to be taken into account and the A1 or A2 
value to be applied shall be that corresponding to the parent nuclide of 
that chain. In the case of radioactive decay chains in which any daughter 
nuclide has a half-life either longer than 10 days or longer than that of the 
parent nuclide, the parent and such daughter nuclides shall be considered 
as mixtures of different nuclides.

limit for exempt material or the activity limit for an exempt consignment 
as appropriate for the radionuclide i. 
Xm is the derived value of A1 or A2, or the activity concentration limit for 
exempt material or the activity limit for an exempt consignment in the 
case of a mixture. 
Paragraph 406. When the identity of each radionuclide is known but the 
individual activities of some of the radionuclides are not known, the 
radionuclides may be grouped and the lowest radionuclide value, as 
appropriate for the radionuclides in each group, may be used in applying 
the formulas in paras 405 and 430. Groups may be based on the total 
alpha activity and the total beta/gamma activity when these are known, 
using the lowest radionuclide values for the alpha emitters or beta/gamma 
emitters, respectively. 
Paragraph 407. For individual radionuclides or for mixtures of 
radionuclides for which relevant data are not available, the values shown 
in Table 3 shall be used. 
(2) LSA material is classified as LSA-II material if it 
consists of material 
(a) that is less than 225 L of water with a tritium 
concentration that has an activity level not greater 
than 0.8 TBq/L; or 
(b) in which the activity is distributed throughout and 
for which the estimated average specific activity does 
not exceed 10-4 A2/g for solids and gases and 10-5 
A2/g for liquids. 
 
(3) LSA material is classified as LSA-III material if it 
consists of solid material that is not in powder form and 
that meets the applicable requirements of the IAEA 
Regulations.

MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS 
 
39. For the purpose of the definition “release” in section 
2 of the Transportation of Dangerous Goods Act, 
1992, the following levels of ionizing radiation are 
established: 
(a) in respect of a package that is being transported 
under exclusive use, 
(i) 10 mSv/h on the external surface of the package, 
(ii) 2 mSv/h on the surface of the conveyance, and 
(iii) 0.1 mSv/h at a distance of 2 m from the surface 
of the conveyance; and 
(b) in respect of a package that is not being 
transported under exclusive use, 
(i) 2 mSv/h on the external surface of the package, 
(ii) 0.1 mSv/h at a distance of 1 m from the 
package, 
(iii) 2 mSv/h on the surface of the conveyance, and 
(iv) 0.1 mSv/h at a distance of 2 m from the surface

“release” means, in relation to dangerous goods, 
(a) a discharge, emission, explosion, outgassing or other escape of 
dangerous goods, or any component or compound evolving from 
dangerous goods, from a means of containment being used to handle or 
transport the dangerous goods, or 
(b) an emission, from a means of containment being used to handle or 
transport dangerous goods, of ionizing radiation that exceeds a level or 
limit established under the Nuclear Safety and Control Act; 
40. (1) A person, other than the consignor or the 
consignee of the package, may open a package only if 
(a) measures are taken to prevent persons from 
receiving doses of radiation higher than the radiation 
dose limits prescribed by the Radiation Protection 
Regulations; and 
(b) the package is opened in the presence of an 
expert in radiation protection.
