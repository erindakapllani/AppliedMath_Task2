Preface 
This regulatory document is part of the CNSC’s Human Performance Management series of regulatory 
documents, which also covers human factors, personnel training and personnel certification. The full list 
of regulatory document series is included at the end of this document and can also be found on the 
CNSC’s website. 
Regulatory document REGDOC-2.2.4, Fitness for Duty, sets out requirements and guidance for managing 
fitness for duty of workers at all high-security sites, as defined in the Nuclear Security Regulations.  
REGDOC-2.2.4 has incorporated the content of RD-363, Nuclear Security Officer Medical, Physical, and 
Psychological Fitness. Once published, REGDOC-2.2.4 will replace RD-363. 
REGDOC-2.2.4 is intended to form part of the licensing basis for a regulated facility or activity within the 
scope of the document. It is intended for inclusion in licences as either part of the conditions and safety 
and control measures in a licence, or as part of the safety and control measures to be described in a 
licence application and the documents needed to support that application. 
The CNSC’s regulatory framework includes CNSC regulatory documents as well as national and 
international standards. Specifically, the Canadian Standards Association (CSA Group) N-Series 
standards provides an interlinked set of regulatory requirements for the management of nuclear facilities 
and activities. The CSA N286 standard provides an overall management framework and direction to 
develop and implement sound management practices and controls for the licensing basis. This regulatory 
document does not duplicate the generic requirements of CSA N286. However, it provides more specific 
direction for those requirements. 
For proposed new regulated facilities and activities, this document will be used to assess licence 
applications. 
Guidance contained in this document exists to inform the applicant, to elaborate further on requirements 
or to provide direction to licensees and applicants on how to meet requirements. It also provides more 
information about how CNSC staff evaluate specific problems or data during their review of licence 
applications. Licensees are expected to review and consider guidance; should they choose not to follow it, 
they should explain how their chosen alternate approach meets regulatory requirements.  
For existing facilities: The requirements contained in this document do not apply unless they have been 
included, in whole or in part, in the licence or licensing basis.  
A graded approach, commensurate with risk, may be defined and used when applying the requirements 
and guidance contained in this regulatory document. The use of a graded approach is not a relaxation of 
requirements. With a graded approach, the application of requirements is commensurate with the risks 
and particular characteristics of the facility or activity.

Important note: Where referenced in a licence either directly or indirectly (such as through licensee-
referenced documents), this document is part of the licensing basis for a regulated facility or activity.  
The licensing basis sets the boundary conditions for acceptable performance at a regulated facility or 
activity, and establishes the basis for the CNSC’s compliance program for that regulated facility or 
activity.  
Where this document is part of the licensing basis, the word “shall” is used to express a requirement to 
be satisfied by the licensee or licence applicant. “Should” is used to express guidance or that which is 
advised. “May” is used to express an option or that which is advised or permissible within the limits of 
this regulatory document. “Can” is used to express possibility or capability. 
Nothing contained in this document is to be construed as relieving any licensee from any other 
pertinent requirements. It is the licensee’s responsibility to identify and comply with all applicable 
regulations and licence conditions.

Fitness for Duty 
1. 
Introduction 
1.1 Purpose 
This regulatory document establishes requirements and guidance for managing worker fitness for 
duty.  
1.2 Scope 
This regulatory document is intended for high-security sites as defined in the Nuclear Security 
Regulations. The requirements and guidance in section 3 of this regulatory document apply to all 
workers who could pose a risk to nuclear safety or security, also referred to as the broad 
population. Requirements and guidance in sections 4 and 5 apply only to a subset of workers 
holding safety-sensitive positions as described in section 4.1.  
1.3 Relevant legislation 
The following provisions of the Nuclear Safety and Control Act (NSCA) and regulations made 
under the Act are relevant to this regulatory document: 
• 
Subparagraph 9(a)(i) of the NSCA states that one of the objects of the Commission is “to 
regulate the development, production and use of nuclear energy and the production, 
possession and use of nuclear substances, prescribed equipment and prescribed information in 
order to prevent unreasonable risk, to the environment and to the health and safety of persons, 
associated with that development, production, possession or use”. 
• 
Paragraph 12(1)(a) of the General Nuclear Safety and Control Regulations  requires that 
every licensee shall “ensure the presence of a sufficient number of qualified workers to carry 
on the licensed activity safely and in accordance with the Act, the regulations made under the 
Act and the licence”. 
• 
Paragraph 12(1)(b) of the General Nuclear Safety and Control Regulations requires that 
every licensee shall “train the workers to carry on the licensed activity in accordance with the 
Act, the regulations made under the Act and the licence”. 
• 
Paragraph 17(b) of the General Nuclear Safety and Control Regulations requires that every 
worker shall “comply with the measures established by the licensee to protect the 
environment and the health and safety of persons, maintain security, control the levels and 
doses of radiation, and control releases of radioactive nuclear substances and hazardous 
substances into the environment”. 
• 
Subparagraph 17(c)(i) of the General Nuclear Safety and Control Regulations requires that 
every worker shall “promptly inform the licensee or the worker’s supervisor of any situation 
in which the worker believes there may be a significant increase in the risk to the 
environment or the health and safety of persons”. 
• 
Paragraph 17(e) of the General Nuclear Safety and Control Regulations requires that every 
worker shall “take all reasonable precautions to ensure the worker’s own safety, the safety of 
the other persons at the site of the licensed activity, the protection of the environment, the 
protection of the public and the maintenance of the security of nuclear facilities and of 
nuclear substances”.

• 
Paragraph 6(d) of the Class I Nuclear Facilities Regulations stipulates that an application for 
a licence to operate a Class I nuclear facility shall contain “the proposed measures, policies, 
methods and procedures for operating and maintaining the nuclear facility”. 
• 
Paragraph 6(n) of the Class I Nuclear Facilities Regulations stipulates that an application for 
a licence to operate a Class I nuclear facility shall contain “the results that have been 
achieved in implementing the program for recruiting, training and qualifying workers in 
respect of the operation and maintenance of the nuclear facility”. 
• 
Subsection 18(2) of the Nuclear Security Regulations states that “subject to section 18.6, no 
person shall act as a nuclear security officer without the recorded authorization of the 
licensee”. 
• 
Section 18.2 of the Nuclear Security Regulations requires that “a licensee, before issuing an 
authorization referred to in subsection 18(2) to a person referred to in that subsection, shall 
satisfy the conditions set out in section 18.1 in respect of the person — other than the 
condition set out in paragraph 17(2)(b) — and shall obtain from the person  
(a) documentary proof that the person is a Canadian citizen or a permanent resident within 
the meaning of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act; 
(b) a certificate, signed by a duly qualified medical practitioner, certifying that the person 
does not have a medical condition that would prevent them from performing the tasks that are 
likely to be assigned by the licensee; 
(c) a certificate, signed by a fitness consultant recognized by the Canadian Society for 
Exercise Physiology or a person with equivalent or higher qualifications, certifying that the 
person is physically able to perform tasks that are likely to be assigned by the licensee; and 
(d) a certificate, signed by a duly qualified psychologist, certifying that the person is 
psychologically able to perform tasks that are likely to be assigned by the licensee.” 
• 
Section 18.4 of the Nuclear Security Regulations states that “an authorization referred to in 
section 18 may be issued for any term not exceeding five years and shall be subject to any 
terms and conditions necessary to minimize the risk to the security of the facility.” 
• 
Section 38 of the Nuclear Security Regulations requires that “every licensee shall develop a 
supervisory awareness program and implement it on an ongoing basis to ensure that its 
supervisors are trained to recognize behavioural changes in all personnel, including 
contractors, that could pose a risk to security at a facility at which it carries on licensed 
activities”. 
1.4 Relevant international standards and guidelines 
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has identified the need for nuclear facilities to 
address fitness for duty. The IAEA’s framework that supports fitness for duty is embedded in two 
safety requirement documents [1, 2] and in numerous safety guides [3-6]. 
For all nuclear facilities, the IAEA recommends that regulators inspect licensees’ fitness-for-duty 
programs and evaluate their effectiveness [3]. Regulators are also to ensure nuclear facility 
operators have “guidelines on fitness for duty in relation to hours of work, health, and substance 
abuse” [4]. 
With respect to drugs and alcohol, the IAEA recommends that all nuclear facilities have 
guidelines on fitness for duty related to substance use. Licensees are to establish and implement a 
policy applicable to employees, contractors and visitors, which addresses “the illicit use of drugs 
… and alcohol abuse, in consonance with national regulations” [5]. Licensees are to have 
methods for identifying those with a tendency toward alcohol or drug abuse, and it is 
recommended that administrative controls be established to allow the fitness for duty of shift

REGDOC-2.2.4, Fitness for Duty 
 
personnel to be observed, verified and controlled. As well, the IAEA also advises that “personnel 
prone to drug or alcohol abuse should not be employed for safety related tasks” [6]. 
2. 
Background 
Human performance is a key contributor to the safety and security of nuclear facilities. One factor 
that affects human performance is fitness for duty. For the purposes of this document fitness for 
duty is defined as: 
A condition in which workers are physically, physiologically, and psychologically capable of 
competently and safely performing their tasks. 
The implementation of an effective fitness-for-duty program provides reasonable assurance that 
workers have the capacity, and are free of any impairment that could hinder their ability, to 
competently and safely perform the duties of their position, and as such do not pose a safety or 
security risk. 
The fitness-for-duty requirements herein represent reasonable occupational and operational 
requirements for the applicable worker population [7]. An employer is responsible for assessing 
the extent, where considered necessary, of the duty to accommodate. The licensee is also 
responsible for ensuring that any duties assigned to a worker do not pose a risk to his or her 
health or safety, the health or safety of others, the safety of the facility, and do not impact the 
effectiveness of the licensee’s operation. 
3. 
Programmatic Elements Applicable to the Broad Population 
Licensees shall manage the fitness for duty of workers who could pose a risk to nuclear safety or 
security (also referred to as the broad population) in accordance with their management system as 
defined in the licensee’s licensing basis. The following subsections specify how the management 
system’s generic requirements apply to managing fitness for duty. Additional elements including 
fitness for duty-related policy statements, programs and processes are also addressed. 
Licensees shall identify positions in the broad population in their governing documents. 
 
3.1 Policy statements 
Licensees shall establish, implement and maintain clear fitness-for-duty policy statements. The 
policy statements shall provide workers with information on what is expected of them and the 
consequences that may result from policy violations.  
Under these policy statements, licensees shall: 
1. address factors that could adversely affect the worker’s ability to competently and safely 
perform his or her duties 
2. prohibit reporting to work or remaining at work under the influence of alcohol or illicit drugs 
3. prohibit bringing, keeping or consuming alcohol, illicit drugs, drug paraphernalia, or 
prescribed medications without a legal prescription on the grounds of the high-security site 
4. reinforce the responsible use of prescription, or over-the-counter medications, and the process 
to follow if a medication is used that impairs or has the potential to impair a worker’s ability 
to competently and safely perform his or her duties

5. address stand-by, on call, and unexpected call-in requirements related to fitness for duty 
6. describe the responsibilities of workers, supervisors, oversight personnel and escorts to report 
fitness-for-duty concerns 
Guidance 
In developing policy statements, several factors that are known to adversely affect workers’ 
ability to competently and safely perform their duties should be addressed. These include mental 
stress, fatigue, illness, injury, alcohol and drug use. 
3.2 Fitness-for-duty program 
The licensee shall implement a documented fitness-for-duty program that includes a set of 
coordinated measures designed to provide reasonable assurance that workers are capable of 
performing their tasks and as such do not pose a risk to their safety, the safety of others, or the 
safety or security of the facility. 
3.3 Authorities, accountabilities and responsibilities 
Licensees shall define and document the authorities, accountabilities, and responsibilities for 
those involved with managing worker fitness for duty including the interfaces with external 
organizations. 
Guidance 
Licensees should define and document the authorities, accountabilities, and responsibilities for 
the following, if applicable: 
• 
senior management 
• 
supervisors, oversight personnel and escorts 
• 
workers 
• 
security personnel 
• 
human resources 
• 
fitness-for-duty program administrators 
•

3.4 General fitness-for-duty process  
Licensees shall establish, implement and maintain a process to identify and manage workers who 
have temporary or ongoing limitations that may make them incapable of performing their 
assigned duties competently and safely. This process shall include actions for a supervisor to take 
if he or she believes, through self-reporting, peer reporting, observed behaviour, physical 
condition, a fitness-for-duty screening or assessment, a health professional’s report or after 
receiving credible information, that a worker may be unable to competently and safely perform 
his or her assigned duties. 
Licensees shall establish, implement and maintain a referral process to guide workers to seek 
assistance from the appropriate resources. 
When fitness-for-duty assessments are conducted, they shall be conducted by a duly qualified 
health professional who shall categorize the job applicant’s or incumbent’s fitness with respect to 
the job performance requirements for the position. The health professional’s report to the licensee 
shall certify that the applicant or incumbent worker is either fit, unfit, or fit to perform with 
restrictions. These restrictions shall be reported as either temporary or permanent. 
Licensees shall identify the conditions under which a fitness-for-duty assessment is required to 
make return-to-work recommendations. 
Guidance 
The fitness-for-duty process should include both self-referrals and directed referrals to 
appropriate fitness-for-duty resources, such as health professionals, employee assistance program 
provider, or testing program through the fitness-for duty administrator. Processes should identify 
the conditions that will warrant for-cause assessments.   
 
Prior to a directed referral based on observed behaviour, a fitness-for-duty screening should be 
conducted. The screening should be based on face-to-face interaction between the worker, his or 
her supervisor and at least one other person. A screening checklist should be used. 
 
3.5 Access to assistance 
Licensees shall ensure that workers have access to an EAP. EAPs shall be designed to achieve 
early intervention and provide confidential assistance. 
Guidance 
The EAP should offer confidential assessment, short-term counselling, referral services, and 
treatment monitoring to workers who have problems that could adversely affect the worker’s 
ability to competently and safely perform his or her duties. 
3.6 Behavioural observation 
Licensees shall ensure that all workers who could pose a risk to nuclear safety or security at high-
security sites are subject to behavioural observation. 
 
5 
Draft 
November 2015 
REGDOC-2.2.4, Fitness for Duty 
 
3.6.1 
Peer observation and reporting 
Licensees shall ensure that expectations regarding peer observation and reporting are included in 
their fitness-for-duty processes and aligned with their respective policy statements on peer 
observation. 
3.6.2 
Supervisory awareness program 
As indicated in section 1.3 of this document, section 38 of the Nuclear Security Regulations 
requires licensees to develop a supervisory awareness program. This is to ensure that supervisors 
are trained to recognize behavioural changes in all personnel, including contractors that could 
pose a risk to security at a facility.  
Supervisory awareness training shall be delivered to supervisors and other designated personnel 
identified by the licensee. 
Guidance 
Observations related to a worker’s fitness for duty should be made in a variety of situations, such 
as during task assignments, observation and coaching sessions, field inspections, pre-job 
briefings, performance reviews, one-on-one sessions, shift turnovers and incident investigations. 
A process to document and trend aberrant behavioural incidents (acute vs. repetitive) for 
individual workers should be established to facilitate appropriate intervention strategies based on 
risk. 
Supervisory awareness training should include the following aspects: 
• 
knowledge of the authorities, accountabilities, and responsibilities of supervisors and other 
designated personnel with respect to behavioural observation 
• 
knowledge of the interfaces between related fitness-for-duty policies, procedures, and 
supporting programs 
• 
the ability to detect, assess, and effectively respond to behaviours that have the potential to 
impact safety and security  
• 
the ability to detect behaviours that may indicate the possible use, sale, or possession of 
illegal drugs; use or possession of alcohol or impairment from prescription and over-the-
counter medication onsite or while on duty 
• 
the ability to detect  behaviours that may indicate impairment from fatigue or any mental or 
physical  impairment that, if left unattended, may pose a risk to safety and security 
3.7 Assessment and continual improvement 
An assessment of the fitness-for-duty program and the supervisory awareness program shall be 
performed periodically to identify opportunities for continual improvement and to confirm the 
program’s effectiveness. 
Licensees shall carry out trend analyses of problems and causes related to fitness for duty.

3.8 Training, education, and awareness 
Licensees shall ensure that those with authorities, accountabilities, and responsibilities for 
managing fitness for duty, including workers, receive initial and continuing training 
commensurate with their authorities, accountabilities, and responsibilities.  
Guidance 
Licensees’ training, education, and awareness for workers who are subject to the fitness-for-duty 
program should include the following aspects: 
• 
knowledge of the fitness-for-duty policy statements and procedures that apply to the worker, 
the methods that will be used to implement them, and the consequences of violating the 
policy and procedures 
• 
knowledge of the individual’s authorities, accountabilities, and responsibilities under the 
fitness-for-duty program 
• 
knowledge of the EAP services available to the worker 
• 
knowledge of the health and safety hazards associated with abuse of illegal and legal drugs 
and alcohol 
• 
knowledge of the potential adverse effects on job performance of prescription and over-the-
counter drugs, alcohol, dietary factors, illness, mental stress, and fatigue 
• 
knowledge of the prescription and over-the-counter drugs and dietary factors that have the 
potential to affect drug and alcohol test results 
• 
the ability to detect behaviours in peers that may indicate the possible use, sale or possession 
of illegal drugs; use or possession of alcohol or impairment from prescription and over-the-
counter medication on site or while on duty 
• 
the ability to detect behaviours that may indicate impairment from fatigue or any mental or 
physical impairment that, if left unattended, may pose a risk to safety and security 
• 
knowledge of the individual’s responsibility to report a fitness-for-duty concern and the 
ability to initiate appropriate actions related to self- and peer-reporting 
Additional requirements and guidance related to training can be found in sections 3.6.2, 
Supervisory awareness program; 5.4.1, Breath alcohol testing process; 5.4.2, Urine drug-testing 
process; and 5.6, Investigative and impairment screening tools.

Specific Fitness-for-duty Assessments and Tests for Safety-Sensitive Positions 
4.1 Identification of safety-sensitive positions 
Licensees shall identify safety-sensitive positions through a documented, risk-informed analysis.  
 
7 
Draft 
November 2015 
REGDOC-2.2.4, Fitness for Duty 
 
Safety-sensitive positions shall include: 
1. certified workers 
2. the following security personnel: Nuclear Security Officers (NSOs), onsite nuclear response 
force (NRF) members, and designated non-NRF personnel 
3. positions that are part of the minimum staff complement at high-power reactor facilities, 
unless excluded based on the results of the risk-informed analysis 
4. any other positions identified via the risk-informed analysis performed by the licensee  
Licensees shall list all safety-sensitive positions in their governing documents. 
Guidance 
The risk-informed analysis to identify safety-sensitive positions should consider the following: 
• 
tasks of the worker during normal and emergency operating conditions 
• 
nature of equipment and material that he or she handles or could handle 
• 
actions assigned to the workgroup that could directly cause or contribute to a significant 
incident; or could result in an inadequate response to a significant incident 
Additional information regarding certified workers may be found in RD-204, Certification of 
Persons Working at Nuclear Power Plants [8]. 
4.2 Identification of fitness-for-duty requirements 
Licensees shall establish, implement and maintain a process for identifying medical, 
psychological, and occupational fitness requirements that are appropriate to the worker’s job 
performance requirements.  
For each safety-sensitive position, licensees shall clearly document applicable fitness-for-duty 
requirements. Fitness-for-duty assessments and tests and the circumstances under which the 
assessments and tests are to be conducted shall be specified. The medical, psychological and 
occupational fitness assessments and tests specified in this section and summarized in appendix A 
shall be included. 
Note that for NSOs and NSOs with NRF qualifications, some of these requirements are 
prescribed in the Nuclear Security Regulations. 
Guidance 
The process for identifying fitness-for-duty requirements should be risk-informed and should 
consider the tasks of the worker during normal and emergency operating conditions, and the 
nature of equipment and material that he or she handles or could handle. Consideration should be 
made for workers required to conduct tasks, use equipment, or wear personal protective 
equipment that is known to add additional physiological or psychological stress or burden to the 
worker’s duties (e.g., use of respiratory protective equipment). 
In determining which safety-sensitive positions require an occupational fitness assessment or test, 
the physicality of tasks should be rated as part of the job analysis process. The physicality ratings 
could be used along with the ratings of task difficulty, importance and frequency that are 
specified in REGDOC-2.2.2, Personnel Training.

For any leave period where the person has been on military duty in a combat or war zone, the 
licensee shall ensure that the psychologist is aware that the person has been in this type of 
environment so that they can be assessed accordingly. 
The psychological reassessment assists in determining if an NRF applicant, candidate or member 
is psychologically capable of performing the tasks that are likely to be assigned by the licensee 
and as such does not pose a risk to his or her own safety, the safety of others, or the safety and 
security of the facility.  
Designated non-nuclear response force personnel  
Designated non-nuclear response force personnel shall undergo a psychological assessment pre-
placement, and for cause when a mental health concern is suspected or identified. 
A designated non-nuclear response force personnel shall also undergo a psychological assessment

For any leave period where the person has been on military duty in a combat or war zone, the 
licensee shall ensure that the psychologist is aware that the person has been in this type of 
environment so that they can be assessed accordingly. 
The psychological reassessment assists in determining if an applicant or candidate is 
psychologically capable of performing the tasks that are likely to be assigned by the licensee and 
as such does not pose a risk to his or her own safety, the safety of others, or the facility. 
4.4.3 
Minimum staff complement and licensee identified safety-sensitive positions  
Those occupying applicable minimum staff complement positions, including ERT / fire brigade 
members, and licensee-identified safety-sensitive positions (see section 4.1) shall undergo a 
psychological assessment for cause when a mental health concern that may affect fitness for duty 
is suspected or identified. 
4.5 Occupational fitness assessment 
Occupational fitness assessments for safety-sensitive positions shall be conducted in accordance 
with the occupational fitness assessment process described in section 5.3. 
4.5.1 
Certified workers 
Licensees shall evaluate certified workers’ positions to determine which positions require 
occupational fitness assessments or tests (see section 4.2). 
4.5.2 
Security personnel 
Nuclear security officers (including onsite nuclear response force personnel) 
All NSOs shall undergo a physical fitness test pre-placement, periodically at least every 12 
months, and for cause when a physical fitness concern is suspected or identified. 
 
11 
Draft 
November 2015 
REGDOC-2.2.4, Fitness for Duty 
 
The physical fitness test shall be the CNSC-approved NSO Physical Fitness Test found in 
appendix C, or equivalent. 
The physical fitness test requirements for NSOs that are onsite nuclear response force members 
are contained in REGDOC 2.12.1, High-Security Sites: Nuclear Response Force. NRF personnel 
shall undergo a physical fitness test pre-placement, periodically at least every six months, and for 
cause when a physical fitness concern is suspected or identified. In accordance with 
REGDOC-2.12.1, High-Security Sites: Nuclear Response Force, onsite nuclear response force 
members shall also be physically reassessed if the person wishes to return to duty after any period 
of extended leave greater than six months. 
4.5.3 
Minimum staff complement and licensee identified safety-sensitive positions  
Licensees shall evaluate applicable minimum staff complement and licensee-identified safety-
sensitive positions to determine which positions require occupational fitness assessments or tests 
(see section 4.2). 
Emergency response team/fire brigade members at high-security sites that have been identified as 
safety-sensitive positions shall be assessed against the established physical fitness performance 
requirements that are based on assigned emergency response activities, including duties 
conducted under adverse conditions. The assessment shall be conducted pre-placement and 
annually. 
Guidance 
In developing requirements for physical fitness standards for industrial fire brigades, licensees 
should consider the 13 essential job tasks of a local fire department defined in the National Fire 
Protection Association (US) Standard on Comprehensive Occupational Medical Program for 
Fire Departments NFPA 1582 (2013)[16] in the context of fire response for an industrial fire 
brigade at a nuclear facility. 
Given the nature of firefighting, it is important to make a distinction between the individual 
workers responsible for performing fire response and those responsible for directing fire response 
(incident command), as per the fire attack plan. Due to the decrements in physical fitness 
associated with advancing age, licensees should consider the development and adoption of 
physical fitness standard(s) that take age-related fitness declines into account for individuals 
holding incident command roles. 
4.6 Alcohol and drug testing 
Alcohol and drug testing of workers holding safety-sensitive positions shall be conducted in 
accordance with the breath alcohol-testing and urine drug-testing processes described in section 
5.4. 
4.6.1 
Pre-placement alcohol and drug testing 
Licensees shall require all applicants to a safety-sensitive position to submit to alcohol and drug 
testing. Incumbent workers transferring to any safety-sensitive position shall also be required 
to submit to a pre-placement alcohol and drug test. 
 
12 
Draft 
November 2015 
REGDOC-2.2.4, Fitness for Duty 
 
Guidance 
A substance test should not be used as an initial employment screening tool, and should not take 
place before determining that the candidate has met all other qualifications necessary.  
4.6.2 
For-cause alcohol and drug testing 
Licensees shall require all workers in safety-sensitive positions to submit to for-cause testing 
under reasonable grounds and post-incident circumstances. 
Under reasonable grounds testing, workers in safety-sensitive positions shall be required to 
submit to for-cause testing when there is reasonable cause to believe, through observed 
behaviour, physical condition or after receiving credible information, that the individual is unfit 
to perform his or her duties, due to the adverse effects of alcohol or drug use. The grounds for 
for-cause testing shall be independently verified by at least two people (one of whom is the 
supervisor). 
Under post-incident testing, workers in safety-sensitive positions shall be required to submit to 
for-cause testing as soon as practical after a significant incident where a human act or omission 
by the worker may have caused or contributed to the event. 
Guidance 
Observed behaviours and physical conditions that may establish for-cause reasonable grounds 
testing include:  
• 
breath odour 
• 
observed use or possession of alcohol, illicit drugs, or drug paraphernalia 
• 
speech patterns 
• 
physical appearance and behaviour 
• 
an episode or events that suggest irrational or reckless behaviour 
Significant incidents refer to a subset of incidents that have safety significance. See the 
definitions of “incident” and “safety significance”. 
4.6.3 
Follow-up alcohol and drug testing 
Licensees shall require all workers in safety-sensitive positions to submit to follow-up testing 
after confirmation of a substance abuse or dependency issue by a health professional. 
Workers shall be subject to follow-up alcohol and drug testing in an unannounced and random 
fashion every 3 months for a minimum of 2 years. 
4.6.4 
Random alcohol and drug testing 
Licensees shall require all workers holding safety-sensitive positions to submit to random alcohol 
and drug testing. Licensees’ sampling process used to select workers for random testing shall 
ensure that the number of random tests performed annually is equal to at least 25 percent of the 
safety-sensitive position population. 
 
13 
Draft 
November 2015 
REGDOC-2.2.4, Fitness for Duty 
 
Licensees shall develop procedures and practices to ensure that random testing is administered in 
a manner that provides reasonable assurance that individuals are unable to predict when 
specimens will be collected. 
The following shall be addressed for the implementation and conduct of random testing: 
1. ensure that all individuals in the population subject to testing have an equal probability of 
being selected and tested 
2. require that individuals who are offsite when selected for testing, or who are onsite and are 
not reasonably available for testing when selected, be tested at the earliest reasonable 
opportunity when both the donor and collectors are available to collect specimens for testing 
and without prior notification to the individual that he or she has been selected for testing 
3. provide that an individual completing a test is immediately eligible for another unannounced 
test 
Guidance 
The following should be considered for the implementation and conduct of random testing: 
• 
collect specimens on an unpredictable schedule, including weekends, nightshifts and 
holidays, and at various times during a shift 
• 
be administered by the fitness-for-duty program on a nominal weekly frequency 
• 
require individuals who are selected for random testing to report to the collection site as soon 
as reasonably practical after notification, within the time period specified in the fitness-for-
duty program policy 
5. 
Processes to Assess, Test and Monitor Safety-sensitive Positions 
The sub-sections below describe several process-related requirements. Note that distinct and 
separate processes are not necessarily required. 
 
5.1 Medical assessment process 
When conducted, medical assessments shall determine whether the worker, from a medical 
perspective, is capable of performing their tasks and as such does not pose a risk to his or her 
safety, the safety of others or the facility. 
The medical assessment shall be conducted by a duly qualified medical practitioner.  
Subsequent to the medical assessment a certificate shall: 
1. be issued signed by a duly qualified medical practitioner 
2. certify whether or not the worker is medically capable of safely performing their tasks  
3. include any temporary or permanent work restrictions 
Guidance 
To help standardize and improve the transfer of medical information between the examining 
medical practitioner and the licensee’s duly qualified medical practitioner(s), licensees should 
consider use of a standardized medical evaluation report (MER) template [17]. 
 
14 
Draft 
November 2015 
REGDOC-2.2.4, Fitness for Duty 
 
The examining medical practitioner would then complete the MER and forward it to the 
licensee’s duly qualified medical practitioner(s), where information would be reviewed and a 
medical certificate – categorized as fit, unfit, or fit with employment limitations – would be 
forwarded to the licensee’s management. 
5.2 Psychological assessment process 
When conducted, psychological assessments shall determine whether the worker from a 
psychological perspective, is capable of performing their tasks and as such does not pose a risk to 
his or her safety, the safety of others, or the facility. 
The psychological assessment shall include an interview and one or more tests. A duly qualified 
psychologist shall determine the interview and tests to use in the assessment. The interview and 
tests, along with their interpretation, shall be conducted by the duly qualified psychologist. 
Subsequent to the psychological assessment, a certificate shall 
1. be issued and signed by a duly qualified psychologist 
2. certify whether or not the worker is psychologically capable of safely performing their tasks 
3. include any temporary or permanent work restrictions  
5.3 Occupational fitness assessment process 
When conducted, occupational fitness assessments shall determine if the worker possesses the 
physical fitness attributes and capacity to perform their physically demanding tasks and as such 
does not pose a risk to his or her safety, the safety of others, or the facility.  
Licensees shall establish, implement and maintain an occupational fitness assessment process to 
ensure that job performance requirements are met. Licensees shall consider the expected physical 
demands in both normal and emergency conditions. 
Physical fitness tests, when conducted as part of an occupational fitness assessment, shall be 
administered by a fitness consultant recognized by the Canadian Society for Exercise Physiology, 
or a person with equivalent or higher qualifications. Pass/fail criteria for physical fitness tests 
shall be specified. 
Subsequent to the physical fitness test a certificate shall: 
1. be issued signed by a fitness consultant recognized by the Canadian Society for Exercise 
Physiology or a person with equivalent or higher qualifications 
2. certify whether or not the worker is physically capable of safely performing their tasks 
3. include any temporary or permanent work restrictions 
Guidance 
When developing the occupational fitness assessments and tests, licensees should consider the 
safety analysis report, job tasks analysis and physical demands analysis. Additionally, licensees 
should consider the equipment used (task-specific, protective and respiratory), the facility design 
and layout (single- vs. multi-unit), and environmental factors (heat, humidity, and/or cold). 
 
15 
Draft 
November 2015 
REGDOC-2.2.4, Fitness for Duty 
 
Licensees should consider the establishment of a wellness program to enable candidates or 
incumbents to attain and maintain required levels of fitness and recover from potential setbacks in 
fitness due to illness or injury. 
5.4 Alcohol and drug testing process 
5.4.1 
Breath alcohol testing process 
Licensees shall establish, implement and maintain a process to test workers holding safety-
sensitive positions for the presence of alcohol.  
Licensees shall retain or maintain competency in the administration, collection, and analysis of 
evidential breath alcohol testing. The qualified technicians conducting the breath alcohol testing 
shall be independent from workgroups subject to testing. 
Licensees shall ensure that an evidential breath testing instrument is used that has been evaluated, 
tested and recommended by the Alcohol Test Committee (a committee under the auspices of 
Canada’s Department of Justice) as an approved instrument published in the Approved Breath 
Analysis Instruments Order (SI/85-201)[18]. 
Licensees shall establish, implement, and maintain procedures for the administration of evidential 
breath alcohol testing. 
Licensees shall ensure that the following blood alcohol concentrations (BACs) are used for the 
determination of positive breath alcohol test results: 
1. A BAC below 20 mg/100mL shall be considered a negative test, and no further action is 
required. 
2. A BAC from 20 to 39 mg/100mL shall be considered an action level. The licensees shall 
prohibit the worker from performing safety-sensitive duties until a determination of fitness 
indicates that the worker is fit to competently and safely perform his or her duties. 
3. A BAC of 40 mg/100mL or greater shall be considered a positive test and a fitness-for-duty 
policy violation (see section 5.4.3 process for positive alcohol and drug tests). 
Appendix D, table D1 provides a summary of BAC ranges and associated actions [19]. 
Guidance 
Licensees should refer to the Alcohol Test Committee when establishing procedures for the 
administration of evidential breath alcohol testing, including: 
• 
the initial and continuing training and qualification of  breath alcohol technicians for the 
operation of approved instruments, including conversion training 
•

5.4.2 
Urine drug-testing process  
Licensees shall establish, implement and maintain a process to test workers holding safety-
sensitive positions for the presence of drugs.  
Licensees shall develop, implement, and maintain procedures for the administration of urine drug 
testing including the collection, storage, and transportation of specimens to a designated 
accredited laboratory.  
Licensees shall retain or maintain competency in the collection, storage and transportation of 
specimens, and shall ensure that urine collectors are independent from workgroups subject to 
testing.  
Licensees shall retain and utilize the services of a laboratory accredited by the Canada Standards 
Council or the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration to analyze and report 
the results of urine drug specimens. 
Licensees shall direct the accredited laboratory to report positive test results in conjunction with 
the urine drug panel (initial and confirmatory cut-off thresholds) as established in appendix D, 
tables D2 and D3 [20]. 
Licensees shall develop, implement, and maintain a procedure for reviewing and verifying 
positive, adulterated, or invalid urine drug test results from a medical, toxicological or 
pharmacological perspective. The procedure shall ensure that competent specialists are 
designated to review, interpret, and verify the test results for each drug class as specified in the 
urine drug panels in appendix D [20]. 
Licensees shall direct the accredited laboratory to report all positive, adulterated, or invalid test 
results directly to the designated specialist conducting the drug test review. 
In determining whether the donor has violated the fitness-for-duty policy, licensees shall direct 
the designated specialist to: 
1. provide the donor an opportunity to explain any alternative reasons for the positive test result 
2. only report verified positive test results to the licensee 
Licensees shall direct the designated specialist to raise any for-cause directed referrals for other 
fitness-for-duty assessments, as necessary, to ensure safety and security.  
Guidance 
Procedures for the administration of urine drug-testing collection and transportation of specimens 
should include or make reference to the following: 
• 
licensee-approved collection kits, containers, and other supplies for urine specimen collection 
• 
protocol for chain of custody, including relevant forms 
 
17 
Draft 
November 2015

Licensees should retain and utilize the services of a third-party provider, where feasible, for the 
administration, collection, verification and assurance of specimen integrity and chain of custody, 
and shipment of specimens to an accredited laboratory.  
Licensees should consider adopting a dilution protocol and should consider testing samples 
identified as dilute against the urine drug panel (initial and confirmatory cut-off thresholds) 
established in appendix D, table D4 [20]. 
When designating competent specialists to review, interpret, and verify the test results for each 
drug class, licensees should consider the use of MROs, duly qualified forensic toxicologists, or 
duly qualified pharmacists.  
In the event that the designated specialist determines that there is a legitimate medical explanation 
for the positive drug test – such as legitimate use of prescription drugs, or a medical condition – 
the positive test should not be considered verified. However, a fitness-for-duty assessment may 
be required to determine if the worker is fit for duty.  
5.4.3 
Process for positive alcohol and drug tests 
Workers who provide a verified positive alcohol or drug test shall be removed from safety-
sensitive duties and referred to the EAP.  
The licensee shall not consider the worker for reinstatement to safety-sensitive duties until a 
recommendation for reinstatement has been received from a duly qualified health professional.  
5.5 Substance abuse evaluation process 
Licensees shall establish, implement and maintain an assessment process to evaluate workers in 
safety-sensitive positions for substance abuse and or dependency. Licensees shall identify the 
conditions under which a substance abuse evaluation is required. 
Licensees shall ensure that both licit and illicit drugs are addressed.  
The substance abuse evaluation shall be conducted by a duly qualified health professional. Duly 
qualified health professionals shall be certified by a professional association or shall have 
received training in substance abuse evaluation and be affiliated with a college of physicians or 
nurses.

Appendix C: Nuclear security officer physical fitness test 
C.1 
Background 
Physiology is the identification of physiological mechanisms underlying physical activity, thereby 
enabling comprehensive delivery of treatment services concerned with the analysis, improvement, and 
maintenance of health and fitness. The Canadian Society for Exercise Physiology is a voluntary 
organization composed of professionals involved in the scientific study of exercise physiology, exercise 
biochemistry, fitness, and health. The Canadian Society for Exercise Physiology (then known as the 
Canadian Association of Sport Sciences), was founded at the 1967 Pan American Games, in Winnipeg, 
Manitoba – the result of four years of cooperative efforts by the Canadian Medical Association and the 
Canadian Association for Health, Physical Education, Recreation and Dance.  
A physical fitness assessment is a snapshot of a person’s current physical fitness level. The Canadian 
Society for Exercise Physiology sets national standards of practice required for validity, accuracy, and 
reliability in physical fitness assessments. These standards must be met in order for an organization to be 
designated as an Accredited Fitness Appraisal Centre (AFAC). This designation demonstrates meeting 
required criteria for direct physiological exercise assessments, thereby ensuring accurate, valid, and 
reliable data.  
C.2 
Objectives 
This physical fitness test is designed to assess the following:  
1. static balance in three planes of motion, proprioception, and flexibility 
2. base aerobic fitness and agility, middle aerobic fitness 
3. core strength, grip strength and force discrimination 
C.3 
The test 
This physical fitness test involves a series of stations, as described below. In order to pass the physical 
fitness test, the individual must obtain a pass mark at each station. The individual must complete each 
station in the order they appear below. If the individual fails to pass any station, the entire test must be 
repeated. 
Station 1 – Search station 
Station 1 is a series of five traffic cones (18-inch pylons) set in line with a 60.96-cm (2-ft) separation 
between each cone. A symbol (or shape or other identifiable item) measuring about 21 cm (8 in.) is 
concealed by the bottom of the cone. The individual is given the following instructions: 
At the first cone, raise both arms overhead, go up on tiptoes and hold the position for two seconds. Return 
to your original stance. 
Stand at arm’s length from cone, lower into a squat position, tip the cone and report the symbol seen. 
Return the cone to its original position, stand up and return to the start position. 
Move to the second cone, stand at arm’s length with the cone to your left, and lower your body until the 
left hand contacts the top of the cone. Tip the cone with one hand and report the symbol seen. Return the 
cone to its original position, stand up and return to the start position.

Move to the third cone, stand at arm’s length with the cone to your left, and lower your body while 
twisting until the right hand contacts the top of the cone. Tip the cone with one hand and report the 
symbol seen. Return the cone to its original position, stand up and return to the start position. 
Move to the fourth cone, stand at arm’s length with the cone to your right, and lower your body while 
twisting until the left hand contacts the top of the cone. Tip the cone with one hand and report the symbol 
seen Return the cone to its original position, stand up and return to the start position. 
Move to the fifth cone, stand at arm’s length with the cone to your right, and lower your body until the 
right hand contacts the top of the cone. Tip the cone with one hand and report the symbol seen. Return the 
cone to its original position, stand up and return to the start position. 
Return to the first cone wearing a 9-kg (19.8-lb) vest. Perform the above station 1 series again, while 
wearing the vest. 
This vest will be worn for all subsequent stations in the test. 
Station 1 – Pass mark 
The individual must complete station 1 with a maximum of one fault permitted when not wearing a vest, 
and a maximum of two faults permitted when wearing a vest. Faults are defined as: losing balance or 
falling, moving feet after arriving at the cone, knocking over or moving the cone beyond tipping needed 
to identify the hidden symbol, or erroneously reporting the symbol. This station is not timed. 
Station 2A – Speed walk station 
Station 2A is a series of eight speed walks conducted around a rectangular perimeter with 27.43 m (90 ft.) 
sides and 13.72 m (45 ft.) ends, demarcated by perimeter tape circumscribing the perimeter at a 1.22-m 
(4-ft.) height. The individual is given the following instructions: 
At the command “Go”, walk clockwise around the circuit at sufficient speed to complete the circuit 
around the perimeter in less than 51 seconds while under control and without touching the perimeter 
boundary line. Upon return to the start point, rest for 10 seconds. 
This circuit is then repeated seven more times in less than 51 seconds per circuit, with a 10-second rest 
permitted after each lap. Each alternate lap is to be conducted counter-clockwise. 
Station 2A – Pass mark 
The individual must complete station 2A in the prescribed time and without any faults. Faults are defined 
as: tripping, falling or striking the perimeter tape or the tape support at the corners, or not completing the 
circuit in less than 51 seconds. While no faults are permitted, one restart is permitted immediately after 
the first lap only if the first lap speed exceeds 51 seconds.

Station 2B – Stair climb station 
Station 2B is a series of eight stair climbs and descents on a stairway with a 3.66-m (12-ft) vertical rise of 
continuous stairs. The individual is given the following instructions: 
At the command “go”, climb the stairs using the same size step (one or two stairs at a time) throughout 
the climb without using the railing until reaching the top. Time for the climb is stopped and time for the 
rest portion commences. Turn about and immediately descend the stairs under control to the start point.  
The stair climb ascent must be completed in less than 7 seconds, and then repeated seven more times in 
less than 7 seconds per climb, with a 25-second rest after each ascent. This rest starts once reaching the 
top of the climb, and includes the time required to return to the start point. 
Station 2B – Pass mark 
The individual must complete station 2B in the prescribed time and without any faults. Faults are defined 
as: tripping, falling, grabbing the railing during the stair climb, pace change (one stair climb to two stairs 
or vice versa), or not completing the climb in less than 7 seconds. 
Station 3 – Lift/carry for control station 
Station 3 involves a series of movements of a 34.07-litre (36-qt) container loaded with an unstable weight 
load (water) of 12 kg contained freely within the container. The individual stands facing a 1.83 x by 
0.91 m (6 x 3 ft.) table, with the waist touching the table edge. The table is circumscribed by a 0.91 m (3 
ft.) border outward from the table. The original position of the container is marked on the table with a 
rectangular border area 2.54 cm (1 in.) larger on each side in comparison to the container. 
The individual is given the following instructions: 
Lift the container until it is in contact with your chest. Move to the end of the table, keeping the container 
in contact with your chest. Tilt the container right 30 degrees and return it to the centre balanced position. 
Keeping the container in contact with your chest, move to the opposite end of the table. Tilt the container 
left 30 degrees and return it to the centre balanced position. 
Keeping the container in contact with your chest, move to the original start position and place the 
container back in its original position. 
Station 3 – Pass mark 
The individual must complete Station 3with a maximum of one fault. Faults are defined as: dropping the 
container, losing control of the container as evidenced by the need to re grip the container, failure to 
maintain the container in contact with the chest while walking, stepping out of the station path boundary, 
or failure to return the container to the target area.  
The test for the NSO is complete at this point.
