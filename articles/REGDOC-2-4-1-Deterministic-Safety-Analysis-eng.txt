REGDOC 2.4.1, Deterministic Safety Analysis  
Preface 
This regulatory document is part of the CNSC’s Safety Analysis series of regulatory documents. The full 
list of regulatory document series is included at the end of this document and can also be found on the 
CNSC website. 
Regulatory document REGDOC-2.4.1, Deterministic Safety Analysis, sets out requirements and guidance 
for the preparation and presentation of a safety analysis that demonstrates the safety of a nuclear facility. 
To the extent practicable, this document is technology-neutral. This document provides information on 
preparing and presenting deterministic safety analysis reports, including the selection of events to be 
analyzed, acceptance criteria, safety analysis methods, safety analysis documentation, and the review and 
update of safety analysis. 
The document is presented in two parts: Part I applies to nuclear power plants, and Part II addresses small 
reactor facilities. A small reactor facility contains a reactor with a power level of approximately less than 
200 megawatts thermal (MWt), used for research, isotope production, steam generation, electricity 
production or other applications. 
This document supersedes the following regulatory documents: RD-310, Safety Analysis for Nuclear 
Power Plants; GD-310, Guidance on Safety Analysis for Nuclear Power Plants; and 
RD-308, Deterministic Safety Assessment for Small Reactor Facilities. REGDOC-2.4.1 includes 
amendments to reflect lessons learned from the Fukushima nuclear event of March 2011, and to address 
findings from the CNSC’s Fukushima Task Force Report, as applicable to RD-310 and RD-308. 
REGDOC-2.4.1 is intended to form part of the licensing basis for a regulated facility or activity within the 
scope of the document. It is intended for inclusion in licences as either part of the conditions and safety 
and control measures in a licence, or as part of the safety and control measures to be described in a 
licence application and the documents needed to support that application. 
For proposed new facilities: This document will be used to assess new licence applications for reactor 
facilities.   
Guidance contained in this document exists to inform the applicant, to elaborate further on requirements 
or to provide direction to licensees and applicants on how to meet requirements. It also provides more 
information about how CNSC staff evaluate specific problems or data during their review of licence 
applications. Licensees are expected to review and consider guidance; should they choose not to follow it, 
they should explain how their chosen alternate approach meets regulatory requirements.  
For existing facilities: The requirements contained in this document do not apply unless they have been 
included, in whole or in part, in the licence or licensing basis.  
A graded approach, commensurate with risk, may be defined and used when applying the requirements 
and guidance contained in this regulatory document. The use of a graded approach is not a relaxation of 
requirements. With a graded approach, the application of requirements is commensurate with the risks 
and particular characteristics of the facility or activity. 
An applicant or licensee may put forward a case to demonstrate that the intent of a requirement is 
addressed by other means and demonstrated with supportable evidence. 
The requirements and guidance in this document are consistent with modern national and international 
practices addressing issues and elements that control and enhance nuclear safety. In particular, they 
i

establish a modern, risk-informed approach to the categorization of accidents – one that considers a full 
spectrum of possible events, including events of greatest consequence to the public. 
 
 
Important note: Where referenced in a licence either directly or indirectly (such as through licensee-
referenced documents), this document is part of the licensing basis for a regulated facility or activity.  
The licensing basis sets the boundary conditions for acceptable performance at a regulated facility or 
activity and establishes the basis for the CNSC’s compliance program for that regulated facility or 
activity.  
Where this document is part of the licensing basis, the word “shall” is used to express a requirement, 
to be satisfied by the licensee or licence applicant. “Should” is used to express guidance or that which 
is advised. “May” is used to express an option or that which is advised or permissible within the limits 
of this regulatory document. “Can” is used to express possibility or capability. 
Nothing contained in this document is to be construed as relieving any licensee from any other 
pertinent requirements. It is the licensee’s responsibility to identify and comply with all applicable 
regulations and licence conditions.

Deterministic Safety Analysis  
1. 
Introduction 
1.1 
Purpose 
This regulatory document sets out the requirements of the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission 
(CNSC) for deterministic safety analysis for nuclear power plants (NPPs) and small reactor 
facilities. 
The document is comprised of two parts: 
• 
Part I – Nuclear Power Plants 
• 
Part II – Small Reactor Facilities 
The purpose of Part I of this regulatory document is to help assure that during the construction, 
operation or decommissioning of an NPP, adequate safety analyses are completed by, or on 
behalf of, the applicant or licensee in accordance with the Nuclear Safety and Control Act 
(NSCA) and regulatory requirements.  
Guidance is also provided in Part I to ensure that adequate deterministic safety analyses are 
completed in order to demonstrate the safety of the NPP. This information facilitates the conduct, 
review and approval of deterministic safety analyses. 
Part II applies to small reactor facilities. The document allows the use of a graded approach to 
determine the scope and depth of deterministic safety analysis for these facilities. 
1.2 
Scope 
This regulatory document sets out the requirements and guidance for deterministic safety analysis 
for NPPs and small reactor facilities. A small reactor facility is defined as a facility containing a 
reactor with a power level of less than approximately 200 megawatts thermal (MWt), which is 
used for research, isotope production, steam generation, electricity production or other 
applications. 
This regulatory document sets out the requirements and technical criteria related to deterministic 
safety analysis, including the selection of events to be analyzed, acceptance criteria, deterministic 
safety analysis methods, and safety analysis documentation, review and update, and quality 
control. 
1.3 
Relevant regulations 
The relevant sections of the Nuclear Safety and Control Act (NSCA) and the regulations made 
under the NSCA to this regulatory document include: 
• 
Subsection 24(4) of the NSCA provides that the Commission may only issue, renew or 
amend licences if the licensee or the applicant is (a) qualified to carry on the activity that the 
licence authorizes the licensee to carry on, and (b), in carrying out that activity, make 
adequate provision for the protection of the environment, the health and safety of persons and 
the maintenance of national security and measures required to implement international 
obligations to which Canada has agreed.

2. 
Introduction 
Part I of this regulatory document sets out the requirements of the CNSC for deterministic safety 
analysis for nuclear power plants (NPPs). 
Guidance provides information on the preparation and presentation of deterministic safety 
analysis reports, including the selection of events to be analyzed, acceptance criteria, safety 
analysis methods, safety analysis documentation, and the review and update of safety analysis.  
3. 
Deterministic Safety Analysis Objectives 
Safety analysis is an essential element of a safety assessment. It is an analytical study used to 
demonstrate how safety requirements are met for a broad range of operating conditions and 
various initiating events. Safety analysis involves deterministic and probabilistic analyses in 
support of the siting, design, commissioning, operation or decommissioning of an NPP.  
This document focuses on the deterministic safety analysis used in the evaluation of event 
consequences. PSA and hazard analysis are outside the scope of this document – the requirements 
for probabilistic safety assessments for NPPs are provided in regulatory document 
REGDOC-2.4.2, Probabilistic Safety Assessment (PSA) for Nuclear Power Plants (formerly 
S-294).  
The objectives of deterministic analysis are to: 
1. confirm that the design of an NPP meets design and safety requirements 
2. derive or confirm operational limits and conditions that are consistent with the design and 
safety requirements for the NPP 
3. assist in establishing and validating accident management procedures and guidelines 
4. assist in demonstrating that safety goals, which may be established to limit the risks posed by 
the NPP, are met 
This document identifies high-level requirements for conducting and presenting a safety analysis, 
taking into account best national and international practices. 
Guidance 
Safety assessments are systematic processes to verify that applicable safety requirements are met 
in all the lifecycle phases of an NPP. These assessments are performed for various aspects of 
safety, security and safeguards (such as management practices, quality assurance, human 
performance, safety culture, training, design adequacy, safety analysis, equipment fitness for 
service, emergency preparedness, environmental protection, and radiation protection). 
A safety assessment includes the performance of a safety analysis, which is an analytical 
quantitative study performed mainly to demonstrate the safety of an NPP and the adequacy of its 
design and performance. Deterministic safety analysis, probabilistic safety assessment (PSA) and 
hazards analysis are three types of safety analyses.  
 
4 
 
May 2014 
REGDOC-2.4.1, Deterministic Safety Analysis 
 
PSA considers the likelihood and consequences of various plant transients and accidents. The 
primary objectives of the PSA are to help with: 
• 
identifying the sequences of events and their probabilities, which lead to challenges to 
fundamental safety functions, loss of integrity of key structures, release of radionuclides into 
the environment and public health effects 
• 
developing a well-balanced NPP design 
• 
assessing the impact of changes to procedures and/or components on the likelihood of core 
damage 
For new NPPs, PSAs support deterministic safety analysis in identifying complementary design 
features (internationally, these are also called additional safety features) for severe accidents, or 
actions that operators can take during severe accidents to reduce risk. PSAs complement 
deterministic safety assessments. 
A hazards analysis (such as fire hazard assessment or seismic margin assessment) will 
demonstrate the ability of the design to effectively respond to credible common-cause events. 
This analysis is meant to confirm that the NPP design incorporates sufficient diversity and 
physical separation to cope with credible common-cause events. It also confirms that credited 
structures, systems and components (SSCs) are qualified to survive and function during credible 
common-cause events, as applicable.  
3.1 
Guidance on roles of deterministic safety analysis 
The deterministic safety analysis confirms that the design is capable of meeting the safety 
analysis requirements listed above, as well as dose acceptance criteria. It also helps demonstrate 
that safety goals are met, that the design reflects effective defence in depth, and that the plant 
design and operation are acceptable and robust. 
Deterministic safety analysis is used to analyze the behaviour of a plant following a postulated 
failure of equipment, internal or external event, or operator error. For the analyzed event, the 
deterministic safety analysis allows prediction and quantification of challenges to the plant’s 
physical barriers, and the performance of plant systems (particularly safety systems), in order to 
predict failures of barriers to radioactivity releases. 
Deterministic safety analysis methods can be applied to a wide range of plant operating modes 
and events, including normal operation and abnormal operation resulting from equipment failure, 
operator errors and challenges arising from events like fires, floods or earthquakes. 
3.2 
Guidance on objectives of deterministic safety analysis 
1. Confirm that the design of an NPP meets design and safety analysis requirements. This can 
be achieved by: 
• demonstrating that the plant as built can operate safely, taking the effect of aging into 
consideration  
• demonstrating that the design can withstand and effectively respond to identified 
postulated initiating events (PIEs) 
• demonstrating that the applicable expectations for defence in depth established in 
REGDOC-2.5.2, Design of Reactor Facilities: Nuclear Power Plants are met  
 
5 
 
May 2014 
REGDOC-2.4.1, Deterministic Safety Analysis 
 
• predicting expected harsh environmental conditions due to anticipated operational 
occurrences (AOOs), design-basis accidents (DBAs) and beyond-design-basis accidents 
(BDBAs), including severe accidents 
• demonstrating that the provisions for protection against severe accidents are adequate 
(e.g., performance expectations for containment, biological shielding and re-criticality) 
2. Derive or confirm operational limits and conditions that are consistent with the design and 
safety requirements for the NPP. Guidance for this section can be found in CSA N290.15-10, 
Requirements for the Safe Operating Envelope of Nuclear Power Plants, including: 
• 
safety limits for reactor protection and control  
• 
safety limits for engineered safety systems  
• 
operational limits and reference settings for the control systems 
• 
procedural constraints for operational control of processes  
• 
identification of the allowable operating configurations 
3. Assist in establishing and validating accident management procedures and guidelines. Severe 
accident management guidelines are an example. 
4. Assist in demonstrating that safety goals – which may be established to limit the risks posed 
by the NPP – are met (see section 4.2.3.3 for details). Deterministic safety analyses are also 
performed to: 
• assist in confirming or validating the strategies that have been selected to recover the 
plant from an AOO or DBA 
• assist in developing a strategy for the operator to follow, should the automatic actions 
and emergency operating procedures fail to prevent a severe accident 
• confirm that modifications to the design and operation of the NPP have no significant 
adverse effects on safety 
• understand operational transients and plant system response 
• predict source term and doses during severe accidents 
• support emergency programs 
3.3 
Guidance on deterministic safety analysis in confirmation of defence in depth 
The application of the concept of defence in depth to the design of an NPP should be confirmed, 
so the design will provide layers of overlapping provisions, such that any failure would be 
compensated for – or corrected – without causing harm to individuals or the public. Deterministic 
safety analysis is an important part of this confirmation. 
Five levels of defence in depth are defined in REGDOC-2.5.2, Design of Reactor Facilities: 
Nuclear Power Plants. The applicability of deterministic safety analysis to these levels is as 
follows: 
Level 1: The aim of the first level of defence is to prevent deviations from normal operation, and 
to prevent failures of SSCs.  
Good design and proven engineering practices are used to support first-level defence in 
depth.  
Level 2: The aim of the second level of defence is to detect and intercept deviations from normal 
operation in order to prevent AOOs from escalating to accident conditions, and to return 
the plant to a state of normal operation. 
 
6 
 
May 2014 
REGDOC-2.4.1, Deterministic Safety Analysis 
 
To support second-level defence in depth, AOOs are analyzed to demonstrate the 
robustness of the control systems in arresting most AOOs and in preventing damage to 
all SSCs that are not involved in the initiation of an AOO, to the extent that these SSCs 
will remain operable following the AOO. 
Level 3: The aim of the third level of defence is to minimize the consequences of accidents by 
providing inherent safety features, fail-safe design, additional equipment, and 
mitigating procedures.  
To support third-level defence in depth, DBAs (including AOOs with failed second-
level defences) are analyzed to demonstrate the capabilities of the safety systems to 
mitigate any resulting radiological consequences; i.e., to demonstrate meeting the 
prescribed dose limits for DBAs (and AOOs with failed second-level defences) and 
related derived acceptance criteria for protecting fission product release barriers. AOOs 
and DBAs are also analyzed to assist in developing emergency operating procedures 
that define actions that should be taken during these events. 
Note that the event combination of AOO plus independent failure of second-level 
defence in depth should be considered a DBA. In such a case, the dose limit applicable 
to DBAs should apply. 
Level 4: The aim of the fourth level of defence is to ensure that radioactive releases caused by 
severe accidents are kept as low as practicable.  
Level 5: The aim of the fifth level of defence is to mitigate the radiological consequences of 
potential releases of radioactive materials that may result from accident conditions.  
In support of fourth- and fifth-level defence in depth, BDBAs are analyzed. This 
analysis is to provide information in support of design and safety of NPPs, as it relates 
to severe accidents, such as performance of complementary design features 
(internationally, these are also called additional safety features) for severe accidents, or 
actions that operators should take during severe accidents in order to mitigate the 
consequences. The analysis also assists in the development of severe accident 
management guidelines.

human factors considerations, to ensure that credible estimates of human performance are 
used in the analysis 
4.2 
Events to be analyzed 
4.2.1 Identification of events 
The licensee shall use a systematic process to identify events, event sequences, and event 
combinations (“events” hereafter in this document) that can potentially challenge the safety or 
control functions of the NPP. The licensee shall also identify events that may lead to fission 
product releases, including those related to spent fuel pools (also called irradiated fuel bays) and 
fuel-handling systems. This process shall be based on regulatory requirements and guidance, past 
licensing precedents, operational experience, engineering judgment, results of deterministic and 
probabilistic assessments, and any other systematic reviews of the design. 
The identification of events will include at-power and shutdown states. The deterministic analysis 
should also be performed for other states where the reactor is expected to operate for extended 
periods of time and that are not covered by the at-power and shutdown analysis. Common-cause 
events affecting multiple reactor units on a site shall be considered. The list of identified events 
shall be reviewed for completeness during the design and analysis process and modified as 
necessary. 
In addition to events that could challenge the safety or control functions of the NPP, safety 
analysis shall be performed for normal operation. 
Guidance 
The safety analysis is performed for a set of events that could lead to challenges related to the 
NPP’s safety or control functions. These include events caused by SSC failures or human error, 
as well as human-induced or natural common-cause events. 
The events considered in safety analysis could be single PIEs, sequences of several consequential 
events, or combinations of independent events.

REGDOC-2.4.1, Deterministic Safety Analysis 
 
The set of events to be considered in safety analysis is identified using a systematic process and 
by taking into account: 
• 
reviews of the plant design using such methods as hazard and operability analysis, failure 
mode and effects analysis, and master logic diagrams  
• 
lists of events developed for safety analysis of other NPPs, as applicable 
• 
analysis of operating experience data for similar plants 
• 
any events prescribed for inclusion in safety analysis by regulatory requirements 
(e.g., REGDOC-2.5.2, Design of Reactor Facilities: Nuclear Power Plants) 
• 
equipment failures, human errors and common-cause events identified iteratively with PSA 
• 
a cut-off frequency for common-cause events that is consistent across all events 
The list of identified events should be iteratively reviewed for accuracy and completeness as the 
plant design and safety analyses proceed. Reviews should also be periodically conducted 
throughout the NPP lifecycle, to account for new information and requirements. 
This regulatory document requires that, when identifying events, all permissible plant operating 
modes be considered. All operating modes used for extended periods of time should be analyzed. 
Modes that occur transiently or briefly can be addressed without a specific analysis, as long as it 
can be shown that existing safety analyses bound the behaviour and consequences of those states.  
NPP operating modes include, but are not limited to: 
• 
initial approach to reactor criticality 
• 
reactor start-up from shutdown through criticality to power 
• 
steady-state power operation, including both full and low power 
• 
changes in the reactor power level, including load follow modes (if employed) 
• 
reactor shutting down from power operation 
• 
shutdown in a hot standby mode 
• 
shutdown in a cold shutdown mode 
• 
shutdown in a refuelling mode or maintenance mode that opens major closures in the reactor 
coolant pressure boundary 
• 
shutdown in other modes or plant configurations with unique temperature, pressure or coolant 
inventory conditions 
• 
operation of limited duration, with some systems important to safety being unavailable 
For events identified by the systematic process used for this purpose, a full range of 
configurations and operating modes of equipment should be considered in the deterministic safety 
analysis. 
Special plant configurations may occur during major plant modifications such as plant 
refurbishment, lay-up, or decommissioning. These configurations should be considered, and 
potential events should be identified and included in the deterministic safety analysis. 
4.2.2 Scope of events 
The list of events identified for the safety analysis shall include all credible: 
1. component and system failures or malfunctions 
2. operator errors 
 
9 
 
May 2014 
REGDOC-2.4.1, Deterministic Safety Analysis 
 
3. common-cause internally and externally initiated events, including those affecting multiple 
reactor units on a site 
A cut-off frequency shall be selected so that events with a frequency of occurrence less than the 
cut-off limit provide only a negligible contribution to the overall risk posed by the NPP. The 
elimination of such events from the analysis scope shall be justified and the reasons for 
eliminating them documented. 
Guidance 
4.2.2.1 Guidance for normal operation 
During the design phase, the normal plant operation is analyzed as a separate class of event. This 
allows sources of radiation or releases of radioactive materials to be assessed in various modes of 
operation or transition between modes. 
For an existing plant, a safety analysis for normal operation may be required if a new operational 
mode is considered, or if significant design changes (any changes that may alter system 
characteristics) are implemented. 
4.2.2.2 Guidance for failures or malfunctions of structures, systems and components 
SSC failures may include failure to operate when required, erroneous operation and partial 
failures. Events to be considered include: 
• 
failures or malfunctions of active systems, such as pumps, valves, control systems or power 
supply 
• 
failures of passive systems, such as breaks in the reactor’s pressure-retaining boundaries, 
including pipes and rupture discs  
4.2.2.3 Guidance for operator errors  
As initiating events, operator errors normally produce the same results as events caused by 
equipment failure. Therefore, they do not need to be considered separately in the models and 
computer codes for deterministic safety analysis. However, the generic implications of human 
errors as initiating events should be considered to identify any further potential system failures. 
As such, if a specific operator error could result in a unique initiating event, it should be included 
in the list of PIEs for the deterministic safety analysis.  
4.2.2.4 Guidance for internally and externally initiated common-cause events 
Common-cause events are multiple component failures that can be initiated by internal and 
external events (these events could be human-induced or naturally occurring).  
Internal common-cause events include fires, floods of internal origin, explosions, and equipment 
failures (such as turbine breakup) that may generate missiles.  
External, naturally occurring events (triggers for plant equipment failures) that are considered in 
deterministic safety analysis include: 
• 
earthquakes 
• 
external fires 
• 
floods/tsunamis occurring outside the site 
 
10 
 
May 2014 
REGDOC-2.4.1, Deterministic Safety Analysis 
 
• 
biological hazards (for instance, mussels or seaweed affecting cooling water flow and/or 
temperature) 
• 
extreme weather conditions (temperature, precipitation, high winds, tornadoes etc.) 
External initiating events may cause internal and/or external events. For example, an earthquake 
could lead to plant equipment failures, loss of offsite power, flood, tsunami or fire. External 
events may cause accidents in one or more of the units where there are multiple units at a site.  
Human-induced external events that are considered in deterministic safety analysis include: 
• 
aircraft or missile impacts 
• 
explosions at nearby industrial facilities or transportation systems 
• 
release of toxic or corrosive chemicals from nearby industrial facilities or transportation 
systems 
• 
electromagnetic interference 
4.2.2.5 Guidance for combinations of events  
Combinations of events (which may occur either simultaneously or sequentially while restoring 
the plant to a stable state) should be considered.  
Types of combinations include:  
• 
multiple independent failures in equipment important to safety 
• 
failure of a process system and system important to safety 
• 
multiple process system failures 
• 
equipment failures and operator errors 
• 
common-cause events and operator errors 
Examples of event combinations include: 
• 
loss of coolant with subsequent loss of station electrical power, including station blackout 
• 
loss of coolant with loss of containment cooling  
• 
small loss-of-coolant accidents (LOCAs) with failure of primary or secondary 
depressurization  
• 
main steam line break with failure of the operator to initiate a backup cooling system 
4.2.2.6 Guidance for grouping of events 
Many events will be identified by following the aforementioned guidance, although it may not be 
practical or necessary to analyze all of these events. The identified events could be grouped into 
categories based on similarity of the initiating failures, key phenomena, or system and operator 
responses. Examples of event categories include decrease of the reactor coolant inventory, 
reactivity and power anomalies, and increase/decrease of heat removal. Since plant responses to 
an event depend on the design and availability of plant systems, the most suitable classification of 
events may vary. 
In the safety analysis of AOOs and DBAs for Level 3 defence in depth, bounding events should 
be identified for each applicable acceptance criterion within each category of events. In some 
cases, one accident scenario in the same category of events may be more severe in terms of one 
acceptance criterion (for example, containment pressure limit) and another may be more severe in 
 
11 
 
May 2014 
REGDOC-2.4.1, Deterministic Safety Analysis 
 
terms of a different acceptance criterion (for example, public doses). All these scenarios should 
be considered in the safety analysis process as bounding events for different acceptance criteria. 
4.2.2.7 Guidance for subdivision of events 
An event may be divided into sub-events for consideration in safety analysis, when there are 
substantial differences between the subdivided events, such as: 
• 
phenomena occurring at the plant in response to the events 
• 
challenges to safety and systems important to safety 
• 
frequencies 
For example, LOCAs are commonly sub-divided into small-break LOCAs and large-break 
LOCAs because of significant differences in phenomena and challenges to the safety system. 
An event should not be sub-divided without sufficient justification, for the purpose of 
reclassifying one of the resulting sub-events from an AOO to a DBA, or from a DBA to a BDBA, 
or for the purpose of attaining a frequency below the cut-off frequency limits used in PSA. 
4.2.2.8 Guidance for cut-off frequency 
When beginning to identify events, both those of low frequency (including earthquakes with 
consequential tsunamis) and those of minor consequences should be included. In defining the 
scope of events to be analyzed, the deterministic safety analysis should select the same cut-off 
frequency as that used in the probabilistic analysis for the same facility. This frequency is chosen 
so the deterministic analysis can be integrated with the probabilistic analysis. 
Some events may be excluded from the detailed consideration (for example, because of their 
negligible contribution to exceeding the safety goals, or because they are bounded by an analyzed 
event). Such exclusion should be fully justified and the reasons well documented. 
4.2.3 Classification of events 
The identified events shall be classified, based on the results of probabilistic studies and 
engineering judgment, into the following three classes of events: 
1. anticipated operational occurrences : these include all events with frequencies of occurrence 
equal to or greater than 10-2 per reactor year 
2. design-basis accidents : these include events with frequencies of occurrence equal to or 
greater than 10-5 per reactor year, but less than 10-2 per reactor year 
3. beyond-design-basis accidents : these include events with frequencies of occurrence less than 
10-5 per reactor year 
Notes: 
• 
in accordance with REGDOC-2.5.2, Design of Reactor Facilities: Nuclear Power Plants, the 
subset of BDBAs considered in the design of a new NPP is referred to as design-extension 
conditions (DECs) 
• 
DECs do not replace BDBAs in most occurrences in REGDOC-2.4.1, since analysis will 
consider events of lower frequency than DECs; for example, in searching for cliff-edge 
effects, or in analyzing bounding events 
Other factors to be considered in the event classification are any relevant regulatory requirements 
or historical practices. Events with a frequency on the border between two classes of events, or 
 
12 
 
May 2014 
REGDOC-2.4.1, Deterministic Safety Analysis 
 
with substantial uncertainty over the predicted event frequency, shall be classified into the higher 
frequency class. 
Credible common-cause events shall also be classified within the AOO, DBA and BDBA classes. 
Guidance 
Events are classified because each plant state has different safety analysis requirements and 
acceptance criteria. Safety analysis requirements reflect the level of protection in accordance with 
the principle of defence in depth. The normal plant states and accident conditions are considered 
in the safety analysis. Events are classified as follows:  
• 
AOOs: events that are more complex than the normal operation manoeuvres, with the 
potential to challenge the safety of the reactor, and which might be reasonably expected to 
happen during the lifetime of a plant 
• 
DBAs: events that are not expected to occur during the lifetime of a plant but, in accordance 
with the principle of defence in depth, are considered in the design of the NPP; however, 
certain groups of events with lower frequency may also be included in the plant design basis 
• 
BDBAs: events with low probabilities of expected occurrence, which may be more severe 
than DBAs, and – due to multiple failures and/or operator errors – may result in safety 
systems that fail to perform their safety functions, leading to significant core damage, 
challenges to the integrity of the containment barrier, and, eventually, to the release of 
radioactive material from the plant 
Plant states include operational states (normal operation and AOOs) and accident conditions 
(DBAs and BDBAs). However, as established in REGDOC-2.5.2, Design of Reactor Facilities: 
Nuclear Power Plants, the design authority establishes the plant design envelope, which is the 
subset of all plant states considered in the design: normal operation, AOOs, DBAs and DECs  
(see figure 1).

The assessed frequency of occurrence is the basis for event classification, but it is recognized that 
such assessments may be characterized by significant uncertainty. Therefore, an event with a 
predicted frequency that is on the threshold between two classes of events, or with substantial 
uncertainty in the predicted event frequency, is classified into the higher frequency class.  
 
13 
 
May 2014 
REGDOC-2.4.1, Deterministic Safety Analysis 
 
Other factors, such as relevant regulatory requirements or historical practices, may affect the 
selection of certain events for inclusion. In order to establish an understanding of margins of 
safety or the robustness of the design, the regulatory authority may request that certain events be 
analyzed as design-basis accidents, or as representative severe accidents. Past practices and 
experience may indicate that certain scenarios are more critical and should be analyzed as DBAs. 
Some plant operating modes may be used only for short periods of time. Normally, events are 
classified without regard to the frequency of these operating modes. However, in classifying 
events, frequency of operating modes may be considered on a case-by-case basis.  
Examples of events of different classes based on CANDU experience are provided in 
Appendix A. These illustrate possible outputs of the event identification and classification 
process described in section 4.2. This list is for illustration only, and is not meant to be 
comprehensive. It should be noted that, in practice, such a list would normally be generated by 
probabilistic methods. The list will be subject to grouping of events (see section 4.2.2.6). It is 
expected that only representative or bounding events for each group of events would be analyzed.  
4.2.3.1 Guidance for anticipated operational occurrences  
Plant design is expected to be sufficiently robust, such that most AOOs would not require the 
initiation of safety systems to prevent consequential damage to the plant’s SSCs. This is part of 
Level 2 defence in depth, and helps to ensure that events requiring use of safety systems are 
minimized. The plant control systems are expected to compensate for the event’s effects and to 
maintain the plant in a stable state long enough for an operator to intervene. The operator 
intervention may include, if deemed necessary, activation of safety systems and plant shutdown 
according to established procedures. After addressing the initiating event, it should be possible to 
resume plant operations.  
For Level 3 defence in depth, in addition to meeting the above expectations for Level 2 defence in 
depth, the design is also expected to demonstrate with high confidence that safety systems can 
mitigate all AOOs without the assistance of plant control systems.  
Examples of AOOs include those in table 1, which provides examples for a CANDU reactor and 
a light-water reactor (LWR). The following list in table 1 is not exhaustive; a complete list would 
depend on the type of reactor and the design of the plant systems.

4.2.3.2 Guidance for design-basis accidents 
The events leading to DBAs are classified based on the estimated frequencies of equipment 
failures, operator errors or common-cause events. All the events identified as initiators of AOOs 
should also be considered as potential initiators for DBAs, given the relatively high likelihood of 
AOOs and the possibility of additional equipment failures or operator errors.  
Examples of DBAs include those in table 2, which provides examples for CANDU reactors, 
pressurized water reactors (PWRs) and other LWRs. The following list in table 2 is not 
exhaustive. A complete list of DBAs would depend on the type of reactor and actual design.

REGDOC-2.4.1, Deterministic Safety Analysis 
 
4.2.3.3 Guidance for beyond-design-basis accidents 
PSA allows systematic identification of event sequences leading to challenges to the fundamental 
safety functions. Representative event sequences are then analyzed using deterministic safety 
analysis techniques to assess the extent of fuel failures, damage to the reactor core, primary heat 
transport system and containment, and releases of radionuclides. The use of any cut-off limit for 
the frequency of occurrence of analyzed BDBAs should consider the safety goals established for 
the plant and be consistent with the safety analysis objectives.  
Examples of BDBAs include: 
• 
complete loss of the residual heat removal from the reactor core 
• 
complete loss of electrical power for an extended period 
This class of events also includes massive failures of pressure vessels. Some massive failures of 
pressure vessels can be exempted from the deterministic safety analysis, if it can be demonstrated 
that these failures are sufficiently unlikely, and if all the following conditions are satisfied: 
• 
the vessel is designed, fabricated, installed, and operated in compliance with the nuclear 
requirements of the applicable engineering codes and other requirements 
• 
an in-service inspection program is implemented 
• 
operating experience, with vessels of similar design and operating condition, support a low 
likelihood of failure 
• 
the vessel has adequate restraints to limit propagation of damage to the plant 
Note: Although the CANDU heat transport system header is considered a vessel, its failure 
should be postulated in the safety analysis.  
Events that have been excluded from the DBA analysis based on leak-before-break methodology 
are to be considered in the BDBA sequences. For example, any large LOCA or main steam line 
break that may have been excluded from the design basis accident set should be considered for 
the BDBA analysis. 
4.3 
Acceptance criteria 
Acceptance criteria are established to serve as thresholds of safe operation in normal operation, 
AOOs, DBAs and, to the extent practicable, for BDBAs. The limits and conditions used by plant 
designers and operators should be supported by adequate experimental evidence, and be 
consistent with the safety analysis acceptance criteria as described in sections 4.3.1 to 4.3.4. 
4.3.1 Normal operation 
Analysis for normal operation of the NPP, performed during the design phase, shall demonstrate 
that: 
1. radiological doses to workers and members of the public are within the limits acceptable to 
the CNSC 
2. releases of radioactive material into the environment fall within the allowable limits for 
normal operation 
 
 
16 
 
May 2014 
REGDOC-2.4.1, Deterministic Safety Analysis 
 
Guidance 
The deterministic safety analysis for normal operation should: 
• 
verify the set points of the safety systems, to demonstrate that their initiation would occur 
only when needed 
• 
verify that process controls and alarms are effective in reducing (or avoiding) the need for 
safety system actions 
• 
address all NPP conditions under which systems and equipment are operated as expected, 
with no internal or external challenges, including all the operational configurations for which 
the NPP was designed to operate in the course of normal operations over its life, both at 
power and at shutdown 
4.3.2 Anticipated operational occurrences and design-basis accidents 
Analysis for AOOs and DBAs shall demonstrate that: 
1. radiological doses to members of the public do not exceed the established limits 
2. the derived acceptance criteria, established in accordance with section 4.3.4 are met 
Guidance 
The aim of safety analysis for AOOs and DBAs is to demonstrate the effectiveness of the 
following key safety functions: 
• 
controlling the reactor power, including shutting down the reactor and maintaining it in a 
shutdown state 
• 
removing heat from the core 
• 
preserving the integrity of fission product barriers 
• 
preserving component fitness for service for AOOs 
• 
ensuring that the consequences of radioactive releases are below the acceptable limits 
• 
monitoring critical safety parameters 
Acceptance criteria for AOOs and DBAs should include:  
• 
acceptance criteria that relate to doses to the public 
• 
derived acceptance criteria that relate to the protection of the defence-in-depth physical 
barriers (see section 4.3.4 and Appendix B for examples) 
The committed whole-body dose for average members of the critical groups who are most at risk, 
at or beyond the site boundary, is calculated in the deterministic safety analysis for a period of 
30 days after the analyzed event. 
This dose is less than or equal to one of the following dose acceptance criteria: 
• 
0.5 millisievert for any AOO 
• 
20 millisieverts for any DBA 
These dose limits apply to new NPPs. For existing reactors, the dose limits specified in the 
operating licences must be met.  
 
17 
 
May 2014 
REGDOC-2.4.1, Deterministic Safety Analysis 
 
Note: New NPPs referenced in this section are effectively those first licensed after the issuance of 
RD-337, Design of New Nuclear Power Plants, in 2008. 
To demonstrate that the radiological consequences of an analyzed event do not exceed the limits, 
the doses should be calculated according to the guidance in section 4.4.4.7.  
Acceptance criteria for the class of events with higher frequencies of occurrence should be more 
stringent than those for the class of events with lower frequencies of occurrence.  
To demonstrate compliance with the public dose acceptance criteria for an AOO, the automatic 
isolation and pressure suppression functions of the containment system should not be credited, 
since these functions are normally considered part of Level 3 defence in depth. However, the 
containment passive barrier capability and normally operating containment subsystems could be 
credited, if they are qualified for the AOO conditions.  
Derived acceptance criteria have two components: qualitative and quantitative. Quantitative 
acceptance criteria should be developed, based on direct physical evidence and well-understood 
phenomena, and should account for uncertainties. 
Regarding the qualitative acceptance criteria (such as the examples provided in Appendix B), the 
following guides are applied only to AOOs: 
• 
the qualitative acceptance criteria should be satisfied without reliance on the automatic 
function of the safety systems, for a wide range of AOOs. The plant control systems should 
normally be able to correct transients and prevent damage to the plant’s SSCs 
• 
the control systems should be able to maintain the plant in a stable operating state for a 
sufficiently long time, to allow the operator to diagnose the event, initiate required actions 
and, if necessary, shut the reactor down while following the applicable procedures 
• 
even though control systems may be shown to maintain the plant in a safe state following an 
AOO without the initiation of safety systems (Level 2 defence in depth), it should also be 
shown with high confidence, for all AOOs, that the safety systems can also mitigate the event 
without beneficial actions by the control systems (Level 3 defence in depth) 
Certain accidents with predicted frequency of occurrence less than 10-5 per reactor year could be 
used as the design basis event for a safety system. In this case, DBA dose limits should still be 
met, and the analysis should also consider meeting qualitative acceptance criteria relevant to this 
particular safety system. The safety system performance margins should be sufficient to ensure 
that the DBA dose limits are met. 
4.3.3 Beyond-design-basis accidents 
A safety assessment for BDBAs shall be performed to demonstrate that: 
1. the NPP as designed meets the requirements for release limits established as the safety goals; 
a deterministic safety analysis provides consequence data for accident sequences to use in the 
PSA 
2. the procedures and equipment put in place to handle the accident management needs are 
effective, taking into account the availability of cooling water, material and power supplies; 
consideration can be given to the plant’s full design capabilities, including the possible use of 
safety, non-safety, and temporary systems beyond their originally intended function. 
 
18 
 
May 2014 
REGDOC-2.4.1, Deterministic Safety Analysis 
 
Guidance 
The deterministic and probabilistic safety assessment should demonstrate that the Level 4 defence 
in depth prevents or mitigates the consequences of BDBAs (including severe accidents,) as 
described in REGDOC-2.5.2, Design of Reactor Facilities: Nuclear Power Plants. The BDBA 
deterministic analysis addresses a set of representative sequences, in which the safety systems 
have malfunctioned and some of the barriers to the release of radioactive material may have 
failed, or have been bypassed. The accident sequences for analysis should be relevant and 
representative with respect to the objective of the analysis. In other words, representative BDBAs 
can be selected among the dominant accident sequences from the probabilistic safety assessment, 
or by adding safety system failures or incorrect operator responses to the DBA sequences. In 
general, the results of the PSA studies can be used for this purpose, if they are applicable. 
The aim of safety analysis for BDBAs is to: 
• 
evaluate the ability of the design to withstand challenges posed by BDBA and to identify 
plant vulnerabilities 
• 
assess the effectiveness of those design features which were incorporated in the plant design 
for the specific purpose to reduce the likelihood and/or mitigate the consequences of BDBAs, 
(including the assessment of equipment for accident management and instrumentation to 
monitor the accident) 
• 
evaluate the ability to restore and maintain the safety functions using alternative or diverse 
systems, procedures and methods, including the use of non-safety-grade equipment 
• 
assist in the development of an accident management program for BDBAs and severe 
accident conditions 
• 
provide input for offsite emergency planning  
For events where there are multiple units at a site, as well as for single-unit events, the capacity of 
essential cooling and power supplies should be evaluated.  
The design for BDBAs is aimed to meet risk criteria such as safety goals related to frequency of 
severe core damage and significant releases of radioactivity, as assessed by PSA.  
Deterministic calculations of the source terms for BDBAs can also be performed in accordance 
with the aim of the BDBA analysis. These calculations should demonstrate, for example, that: 
• 
containment failure will not occur in the short term following a severe accident (see 
REGDOC-2.5.2, Design of Reactor Facilities: Nuclear Power Plants) 
• 
the public is provided a level of protection from the consequences of NPP operation, such 
that there is no significant additional risk to the life and health of individuals 
4.3.4 
Acceptance criteria for anticipated operational occurrences and design-basis 
accidents 
Qualitative acceptance criteria shall be established for each AOO and DBA to confirm the 
effectiveness of plant systems in maintaining the integrity of physical barriers against releases of 
radioactive material. These qualitative acceptance criteria shall satisfy the following general 
principles: 
1. avoid the potential for consequential failures resulting from an initiating event. 
2. maintain the structures, systems and components in a configuration that permits the effective 
removal of residual heat.

3. prevent development of complex configurations or physical phenomena that cannot be 
modelled with high confidence. 
4. be consistent with the design requirements for plant systems, structures and components. 
To demonstrate that these qualitative acceptance criteria applicable to the analyzed AOO or DBA 
are met, quantitative derived acceptance criteria shall be identified prior to performing the 
analysis. Such derived acceptance criteria shall be supported by experimental data. 
The results of safety analysis shall meet appropriate derived acceptance criteria with margins 
sufficient to accommodate uncertainties associated with the analysis. 
The analysis shall be performed for the event that poses the most challenges in demonstrating the 
meeting of derived acceptance criteria (i.e., the limiting event in an event category). 
Guidance 
In addition to the dose limits in section 4.3.2, the acceptance criteria for AOOs and DBAs also 
include a set of derived acceptance criteria, such as those examples of qualitative acceptance 
criteria identified in appendix B.  
These acceptance criteria are established by the designer to limit the damage to different defence 
barriers. Compliance with these requirements ensures that there are physical barriers preserved to 
limit the release of radioactive material and prevent unacceptable radiological releases following 
an AOO or DBA. The failure to meet a derived acceptance criterion does not necessarily mean 
that dose limits will be exceeded. However, if the derived acceptance criteria are met with 
significant margin, then the dose calculation can be simplified, because fission product releases 
are expected to be limited. 
The derived acceptance criteria are generally more stringent for events with a higher frequency of 
occurrence. For example, for most AOOs, the actions of the control systems should be able to 
prevent consequential degradation of any of the physical barriers to the extent that the related 
SSCs are no longer fit for continued service (including fuel matrix, fuel sheath/fuel cladding, 
reactor coolant pressure boundary or containment). 
More demanding requirements may be set to demonstrate the availability of a margin between the 
predicted value and the quantitative acceptance criteria, or to simplify an analysis (for example, to 
avoid having to perform complex modelling). The conditions of applicability for each additional 
criterion should be clearly identified. 
For each of the qualitative acceptance criteria, as illustrated in appendix B, quantitative 
acceptance criteria (or limits) should be established. These quantitative limits should: 
• 
be applicable to the particular NPP system and accident scenario 
• 
provide a clear boundary between safe states (when failure of an SSC is prevented with high 
confidence,) and unsafe states (when a failure of an SSC may occur) 
• 
be supported by experimental data 
• 
incorporate margins or safety factors to account for uncertainty in experimental data and 
relevant models 
When there is insufficient data to identify the transition from a safe state to an unsafe state, or to 
develop accurate models, then the quantitative limit for the corresponding safety requirement 
 
20

REGDOC-2.4.1, Deterministic Safety Analysis 
 
should be set at the boundary of the available data, provided that the established limit is 
conservative. 
4.4 
Methods and assumptions for deterministic safety analysis 
4.4.1 General 
The analysis shall provide the appropriate level of confidence in demonstrating conformity with 
the acceptance criteria. To achieve the appropriate level of confidence, the safety analysis shall: 
1. be performed by qualified analysts in accordance with an approved QA process 
2. apply a systematic analysis method 
3. use verified data 
4. use justified assumptions 
5. use verified and validated models and computer codes 
6. build in a degree of conservatism 
7. be subjected to a review process 
Guidance 
Section 4.4 mainly addresses analysis methods and assumptions for the deterministic safety 
analysis of AOOs and DBAs for Level 3 defence in depth. Similar analysis methods and 
assumptions can be applied for Levels 2 and 4 defence in depth (with appropriate levels of 
conservatism). Certain conservative rules, such as the single-failure criterion, are not applied in 
Level 2 and Level 4 analyses. 
The safety analyst has the option of selecting safety analysis methods and assumptions, as long as 
the regulatory requirements and expectations are satisfied. 
The selection of the safety analysis methods and assumptions should be such that the appropriate 
level of confidence can be achieved in the analysis results. 
4.4.2 Method for deterministic safety analysis 
The analysis method shall include the following elements: 
1. identifying the scenarios to be analyzed as required to attain the analysis objectives 
2. identifying the applicable acceptance criteria, safety requirements, and limits 
3. identifying the important phenomena of the analyzed event 
4. selecting the computational methods or computer codes, models, and correlations that have 
been validated for the intended applications 
5. defining boundary and initial conditions 
6. conducting calculations, including: 
a. performing sensitivity analysis and identifying, where necessary, margins to cliff-edge 
effects 
b. analyzing the event from the initial steady state up to a predefined long-term stable 
state, considering the guidance for duration in section 4.4.2.6 
7. accounting for uncertainties in the analysis data and models 
8. verifying calculation results for physical and logical consistency 
9. processing and documenting the results of calculations to demonstrate conformance with the 
acceptance criteria

REGDOC-2.4.1, Deterministic Safety Analysis 
 
Guidance 
The basic elements included in the safety analysis method are described in sections 4.4.2.1 to 
4.4.2.9. There are three main analysis methods used in the deterministic safety analysis: 
• 
conservative analysis method, such as the method used for Level 3 defence in depth 
• 
best-estimate-plus-evaluation–of-uncertainties method, such as the method used for Level 3 
defence in depth 
• 
best-estimate analysis method, such as the method used for Level 2 and Level 4 defence in 
depth 
The first and second methods above are considered as part of the application of conservatism in 
safety analysis, and are addressed in section 4.4.6. Evaluation of uncertainties is elaborated in 
section 4.4.2.7. 
4.4.2.1 Guidance for identifying the scenarios to be analyzed  
The scenario to be analyzed, or the analyzed event, should be defined by including descriptions of 
the following:  
• 
initial conditions 
• 
the initiating event and any additional events 
• 
expected actions of the plant systems and of the operator, in response to the initiating event 
• 
general description of the anticipated transient 
• 
associated safety concerns 
• 
long term stable state (including cold and depressurized shutdown) at the end of an event 
4.4.2.2 Guidance for identifying applicable acceptance criteria  
A set of applicable criteria should be identified, including any regulatory requirements. These 
criteria should address all safety challenges while also demonstrating compliance with the dose 
acceptance criteria given in section 4.3.2, as well as the derived acceptance criteria adopted by the 
designer. In addition to these criteria, others may be defined – in order, for example, to simplify 
the analysis by imposing more restrictive criteria, or to allow intermediate assessments in search 
of bounding cases. 
4.4.2.3 Guidance for identifying important phenomena  
Key phenomena, key parameters, and the range of parameter values associated with the analyzed 
event should be identified. The supporting experimental data should also be provided or 
referenced, and theoretical understanding should be demonstrated. 
If an event is characterized by sufficiently different stages, then key phenomena should be 
identified for each stage. 
The importance of the involved phenomena should be judged against each acceptance criterion, 
separately. Key parameters are identified for each important phenomenon. These parameters are 
then ranked for their importance in influencing the applicable acceptance criteria.  
Sensitivity analyses can be used, in conjunction with expert judgment, to help identify and rank 
the parameters by assessing their influence on analysis results for each acceptance criterion. 
 
22 
 
May 2014 
REGDOC-2.4.1, Deterministic Safety Analysis 
 
Particular importance should be given to the identification of cliff-edge effects, such as any 
abrupt changes in phenomena during any stage of the analysis. 
The results of experiments should also be used to help identify important parameters, assist in 
ranking the importance, and to identify if and where abrupt changes occur. 
4.4.2.4 Guidance for models and computer codes 
Safety analysis is performed using models of the plant systems and physical phenomena. 
All the important phenomena, as identified in section 4.4.2.3, should be represented in the models 
embedded in the computer code used for the calculations. 
The models and computer code applicability to the analyzed event should be demonstrated. 
Models of plant systems should be verified to reflect as-built plant condition, taking into account 
plant states and aging effects (such as pump degradation, steam generator fouling, increased 
roughness). Severe accidents may have a particular impact on NPPs with multiple units at a site; 
this emphasizes the need for a model for severe accidents with multiple units at a site. Further 
guidance is provided in section 4.4.5. 
4.4.2.5 Guidance for defining boundary and initial conditions  
The analysis should define the data characterizing the plant condition preceding the analyzed 
event and plant performance during the event – such as, but not limited to: 
• 
plant operating mode 
• 
reactor power 
• 
fuel burnup and burnup distribution 
• 
fuel temperatures 
• 
coolant temperatures and pressures 
• 
trip set points and action set points for mitigating systems 
• 
instrumentation delays and uncertainties 
• 
safety system performance characteristics 
• 
performance of other plant equipment (such as pumps, valves, coolers, boilers, and turbine) 
• 
weather conditions 
In the application of such data, the plant operating limits and conditions (OLCs) should be taken 
into account. The plant condition used as the initial conditions for the analysis may reflect the 
actual plant condition or (in many cases) reflect the limits selected for enforcement of the OLCs. 
This would be done so that the analysis can confirm that the selection of an OLC value is 
effective. Alternatively, the analysis results may be employed to derive a suitable value for use as 
an operating limit. Care and good judgment are required to ensure that the set of OLCs derived 
from such safety analyses are consistent with each other. 
4.4.2.6 Guidance for conducting calculations  
Comprehensive calculations are conducted to assess the plant performance against each 
applicable acceptance criterion. Sensitivity studies are undertaken to assess the impact on analysis 
results of key assumptions – for example, in identifying the worst single failures in various 
systems, or to assess the impact of using simplified models instead of more accurate and 
sophisticated approaches (requiring significant effort in the calculations). Sensitivity analysis, 
with systematic variations in computer code input variables or modelling parameters, should 
 
23 
 
May 2014 
REGDOC-2.4.1, Deterministic Safety Analysis 
 
confirm that there are no “cliff-edge” effects. A systematic process should be used to identify 
parameters with small margins to a cliff edge, such as fuel dryout, pressure boundary failure and 
tank depletion. Where the likelihood is considered to be high and the potential impact large, 
sensitivity calculations should explore the impact of passing these thresholds. 
The duration of the transients considered in the analysis should be sufficient to determine the 
event consequences. Therefore, the calculations for plant transients are extended beyond the point 
where the NPP has been brought to shutdown and stable core cooling, as established by some 
identified means (i.e., to the point where a long-term stable state has been reached and is expected 
to remain as long as required). The analysis should take into account the capacity and limitations 
of long-term makeup water and electrical power supplies. 
In cases where the various stages of the transient are governed by different phenomena and/or 
different time scales, different methods and tools can be applied to model the consecutive stages. 
4.4.2.7 Guidance for accounting for uncertainties  
In the deterministic safety analysis for Level 3 defence in depth, all key uncertainties should be 
identified and accounted for. The safety analysis for Level 3 should incorporate appropriate 
uncertainty allowances for the parameters relevant to the analyzed accident scenario. Such 
uncertainties include modelling and input plant parameters uncertainties.  
The modelling-relevant parameters include those used to start the action of a mitigating system 
and/or those which can have a significant impact in challenging the integrity of a barrier 
preventing the release of fission products. The modelling uncertainties are associated with the 
models and correlations, the solution scheme, data libraries and deficiencies of the computer 
programs. 
The code accuracy obtained as the result of validation work should be used as a source for 
uncertainties of relevant modelling parameters. The code accuracy is defined by the bias and the 
variability in bias, and should be obtained from the comparison of code predictions with 
experimental data, station data or other applicable data.  
Input plant parameters (also referred to as operational parameters) are those parameters that 
characterize the state of plant’s SSCs or are used to actuate a mitigating system. These are 
measured using in-reactor instrumentation.  
The measurement uncertainties are available from the plant instrumentation and control system 
documentation or the OLCs. The systematic (“bias”) and random uncertainty components 
(“standard deviation”) should be accounted for. 
The measurement bias represents an element of measurement uncertainty arising from a 
systematic error known to cause deviation in a fixed direction. The standard deviation represents 
an element of measurement uncertainty which cannot be defined exactly, or which can cause 
deviation in either direction, but can be estimated on the basis of a probability distribution. 
The aforementioned uncertainties should be accounted for accordingly, either in the conservative 
analysis or in the best-estimate-plus-evaluation-of-uncertainties methodologies.  
In the safety analyses for Level 2 and Level 4 defence in depth (where a realistic, best-estimate 
analysis method may be used) it is not necessary to account for uncertainties to the same extent.

4.4.2.8 Guidance for verification of results 
Verification is performed to ensure that the deterministic safety analysis results are: 
• 
correctly extracted from the analysis codes’ output 
• 
physically and logically sound 
• 
consistent with experimental data from suitable integral tests, plant recorded data, previous 
similar safety analyses or simulations with more advanced models 
• 
bounding predictions for each of the safety analysis acceptance criteria 
4.4.2.9 Guidance for documentation of results 
Results of deterministic safety analysis calculations are documented in such a way as to facilitate 
their review and understanding. The documentation of safety analysis results should include: 
• 
objective of the analysis 
• 
analysis assumptions and their justification  
• 
plant models and modelling assumptions 
• 
any computer code user options that differ from the options used in code validation 
• 
analysis results in comparison with acceptance criteria 
• 
findings and conclusions from sensitivity and uncertainty analyses 
Further guidance is provided in section 4.5. 
4.4.3 Data for deterministic safety analysis 
Assumptions made to simplify the analysis – as well as assumptions concerning the operating 
mode of the NPP, the availability and performance of the systems, and operator actions – shall be 
identified and justified.  
The boundary and initial conditions used as the analysis input data shall: 
1. accurately reflect the NPP configuration 
2. account for the effects of aging of systems, structures and components 
3. account for various permissible operating modes 
4. be supported by experimental data, where operational data are not available 
Significant uncertainties in analysis data, including those associated with NPP performance, 
operational measurements, and modelling parameters, shall be identified. 
Guidance 
This regulatory document requires the safety analysis be based on plant design and complete and 
accurate as-built information.  
Operational historical recorded data (such as thermal power, flow rates, temperature and pressure) 
should also be included, where applicable. This information should cover plant SSCs, 
site-specific characteristics and offsite interfaces. 
For an NPP in the design phase, the operational data, if needed, should be derived from generic 
data from operating plants of similar design, or from research or test results. For an operating 
NPP, the safety analysis should use plant specific operational data. 
 
25 
 
May 2014 
REGDOC-2.4.1, Deterministic Safety Analysis 
 
The safety analysis values for each plant input parameter should be determined based on: 
• 
design specifications 
• 
tolerances 
• 
permissible ranges of variability in operation 
• 
uncertainties in measurement or evaluation for that parameter 
The operational data should include: 
• 
information on component and system performance, as measured during operation or tests 
• 
delays in control systems 
• 
biases and drift of instrumentation 
• 
system unavailability due to maintenance or testing 
Applicable limits for NPP parameters that are used as initial and boundary conditions should be 
identified. The NPP parameters assumed in the safety analysis should bound the ranges of 
parameters allowed by the operating procedures or, in a statistical approach, cover a 
predetermined high percentile of each range at a predetermined high confidence level. 
The following NPP parameters may be used in analysis as input data, and should be specified in 
the OLCs, as measured or evaluated during plant operation: 
• 
neutronic and thermal powers, including power distribution 
• 
pressures 
• 
temperatures 
• 
flows 
• 
levels 
• 
leakage or bypass of valves, seals, boiler tubes, and containment 
• 
inventory of radioactive materials 
• 
fuel sheath defects 
• 
flux shapes 
• 
isotopic purity of coolant and moderator (where relevant) 
• 
neutron poison concentration 
• 
core burnup and burnup distribution 
• 
instrument tolerances 
• 
instrument time constants and delays 
• 
parameters related to SSC aging (besides accounting for aging effects on other parameters)  
• 
position of rods, valves, dampers, doors, gates 
• 
number of operational components, such as pumps and valves 
Note: In the preparation of the data in the list above, there are some parameters (such as core 
burnup and burnup distribution) that are not measured directly. Core characteristics for all fuel 
loads should be accounted for. In this example, they are evaluated and extracted from computer 
simulation for which the accuracy of these tools is supported by station and experimental data. 
There are generally some inputs to the safety analysis that are derived or inferred from data 
obtained experimentally. 
It should also be noted that the effects of aging include long-term mechanisms causing gradual 
degradation as well as mechanisms causing rapid degradation. Degradation mechanisms include 
 
26 
 
May 2014 
REGDOC-2.4.1, Deterministic Safety Analysis 
 
thermal cycles, deformation, strain, creep, scoring, fatigue, cracking, corrosion and erosion. The 
allowed aging limits are part of the safety analysis input data. 
Uncertainties in plant data should be determined and recorded. These uncertainties should be 
considered in the uncertainty and sensitivity analyses. 
4.4.4 Assumptions for deterministic safety analysis 
Assumptions made to simplify the analysis, as well as assumptions concerning the operating 
mode of the nuclear power plant, the availability and performance of the systems, and operator 
actions, shall be identified and justified. 
The analysis of AOO and DBA shall: 
1. apply the single-failure criterion to all safety systems and their support systems  
2. account for consequential failures that may occur as a result of the initiating event 
3. credit actions of systems only when the systems are qualified for the accident conditions, or 
when their actions could have a detrimental effect on the consequences of the analyzed 
accident  
4. account for the possibility of the equipment being taken out of service for maintenance 
5. show that the plant can be maintained in a stable, cold and depressurized state for a prolonged 
period  
6. credit operator actions only when there are: 
a. unambiguous indications of the need for such actions 
b. adequate procedures and sufficient time to perform the required actions 
c. environmental conditions that do not prohibit such actions 
For the analysis of a BDBA, it is acceptable to use a more realistic analysis methodology 
consisting of assumptions that reflect the likely plant configuration, and the expected response of 
plant systems and operators in the analyzed accident. 
Guidance 
Assumptions are made in the input data, such as those related to the design and operating 
parameters, as well as in the physical and numerical models implemented in the computer codes.  
Assumptions may be either intentionally realistic or deliberately biased in a conservative 
direction. 
The assumptions generally used for the Level 3 defence-in-depth analysis of AOOs and DBAs are 
described in sections 4.4.4.1 to 4.4.4.7. It should be noted that some of these assumptions are not 
necessary in the analysis of AOOs for assessing control system capability (Level 2 defence in 
depth,) if such an approach can be justified. 
For BDBA safety analysis, one objective is to demonstrate the capabilities of SSCs to meet the 
design requirements specified for BDBA conditions. The analysis should account for the full 
design capabilities of the plant, including the use of some safety and non-safety systems beyond 
their originally intended function (to return the potential severe accident to a controlled state, or 
to mitigate its consequences). The BDBA analysis assumptions on crediting and modelling plant 
systems and their capability during a BDBA should be consistent with the objectives of the 
analysis. If credit is taken for use of systems beyond their originally intended function, there 
should be a reasonable basis to assume they can and will be used as assumed in analysis. This 
 
27 
 
May 2014 
REGDOC-2.4.1, Deterministic Safety Analysis 
 
basis can be obtained from the evaluation of effectiveness of these systems to operate in severe 
accident conditions, if they are still available. 
4.4.4.1 Guidance for single-failure criterion in safety group  
The single-failure criterion stipulates that the safety group consisting of a safety system and its 
support systems should be able to perform its specified functions even if a failure of single 
component occurs within this group.  
Expectations related to the application of the single-failure criterion in design can be found in 
REGDOC-2.5.2, Design of Reactor Facilities: Nuclear Power Plants.  
The analysis should assume a single failure to occur for each element of a safety group in turn, 
and identify the worst single failure for each acceptance criterion. In addition to a single failure of 
a component, the analysis should account for the impact of possible maintenance, testing, 
inspection or repair on safety group performance.  
Safety analysis of AOOs and DBAs for Level 3 defence in depth should apply the single-failure 
criterion to each safety group. 
The single-failure criterion does not need to be applied in the analysis of AOO for Level 2 
defence in depth and BDBA. 
4.4.4.2 Guidance for consequential failures 
The analysis should take into account consequential failures that may occur as a result of an 
initiating event. 
Any failures that occur as a consequence of the initiating event are part of that event and are not 
considered to be a single failure for the purpose of safety analysis. For example, equipment that is 
not qualified for specific accident conditions should be assumed to fail unless its normal 
operation leads to more conservative results. 
 
28 
 
May 2014 
REGDOC-2.4.1, Deterministic Safety Analysis 
 
4.4.4.3 Guidance on credit for actions of systems: Performance of structures, systems and 
components 
Guidance for availability of systems 
The operation of systems should be credited only when they are designed or shown to be capable 
of performing the intended function, and are qualified to withstand all challenges and cross-link 
effects arising from the accident. 
In the safety analysis of an AOO for Level 2 defence in depth, credit may be taken for the 
operation of process and control systems whose actions could help mitigate the event, as long as 
the credited systems are not impaired as a consequence of the initiating event. The status of these 
systems and the values assigned to their parameters need to be justified. 
In the safety analysis of AOOs and DBAs for Level 3 defence in depth, no credit should be taken 
for the operation of the control systems in mitigating the effects of the initiating event. The 
effects of control system actions should be considered, if these actions would aggravate the 
transient or delay the actuation of the protection features. 
If the operation of non-qualified equipment results in worse event consequences, this will lead to 
the general assumption that such equipment is operated in a manner that makes the event worse. 
Any process equipment that is operating prior to the event is assumed to continue operating, if it 
is not affected by the initiating event. For example, boiler feed can be assumed to continue until 
loss of electrical power, for those events which do not produce a harsh environment. 
Guidance for partial and total failures  
Partial and total failures of equipment should be considered in the analysis of each failure 
sequence, to identify the worst failure for each acceptance criterion. 
Guidance for worst piping failure 
Various modes of piping failures should be considered in loss-of-coolant analyses. They include 
circumferential, guillotine, and longitudinal failures at any location in a system.  
For circumferential and guillotine failures, analysis should consider a discharge area up to, and 
including, twice the cross-sectional area of the piping. 
For longitudinal breaks, the analysis should justify the upper limit of the range of postulated 
break size. 
The worst break location, size, and orientation, in the context of posing the most challenges to a 
safety analysis requirement, should be identified through analysis, including sensitivity analysis, 
using a conservative break model. 
For CANDU reactors, failures of reactor inlet and outlet headers are considered in the same way 
as piping failures. 
 
29 
 
May 2014 
REGDOC-2.4.1, Deterministic Safety Analysis 
 
Guidance for loss of offsite power  
In addition to a single failure and any consequential failures, a loss of offsite power should be 
assumed, unless a justification is provided.  
The loss of offsite power may be assumed to occur either at the initiation of the event or as a 
consequence of reactor and turbine trip. For example, when loss of Class IV power 
(CANDU-type reactor) is assumed, the event should be analyzed both with and without the loss 
of offsite power, and the most limiting results should be used. 
4.4.4.4 Guidance for credit for actions of systems: safety system performance  
Safety systems should be credited at their minimum allowable performance, in accordance with 
the OLCs. 
Guidance for shutdown means  
The deterministic safety analysis should demonstrate the effectiveness of all credited shutdown 
means by demonstrating that the design meets applicable acceptance criteria (see section 4.3). 
This subsection contains different expectations, depending on the reactor’s design and inherent 
characteristics, as described in REGDOC-2.5.2, Design of Reactor Facilities: Nuclear Power 
Plants. Two broad categories of reactors are considered, as follows:  
• 
reactors with inherent safety: designs that demonstrate that any AOO or DBA with failure of 
the fast-acting shutdown means (anticipated transient without reactor trip type analysis) does 
not lead to severe core damage and a significant early challenge to containment  
• 
reactors with engineered safety: designs that cannot demonstrate that any AOO or DBA with 
failure of the fast-acting shutdown means does not lead to severe core damage and a 
significant early challenge to containment 
The following are the applicable acceptance criteria for the two categories of reactors:  
Guidance for shutdown means for reactors with inherent safety 
For the first shutdown means, which is fast-acting, the analysis should demonstrate that the 
criteria applicable to the initiating event class (AOO or DBA, as applicable) are met. Operator 
actions to supplement the fast-acting shutdown means may be credited, provided that the 
conditions for manual reactor trip are satisfied (see end of this subsection). 
For the second shutdown means (that may be manually initiated), the frequency of occurrence of 
an AOO and the failure frequency of the fast-acting shutdown means may result in a combined 
frequency that falls in the DBA range, in which case the applicable limits are the DBA dose 
limits. If the designer can demonstrate a very high reliability for the fast-acting shutdown means, 
it may be acceptable to use BDBA limits (i.e., the safety goals). 
The frequency of a DBA and the failure frequency for the fast-acting shutdown means may result 
in a combined frequency that falls in the BDBA range, in which case the applicable limits are the 
safety goals.

REGDOC-2.4.1, Deterministic Safety Analysis 
 
Guidance for shutdown means for reactors with engineered safety 
The design includes two redundant, fast-acting means of shutdown, both of which should be 
demonstrated to be equally effective (see REGDOC-2.5.2, Design of Reactor Facilities: Nuclear 
Power Plants). The criteria for both shutdown means will be the same, and will be AOO or DBA 
criteria, as applicable to the event class. 
To help better understand trip parameter expectations, table 3 can be used to determine the 
performance objectives for the specific event under consideration. Objectives for reactor designs 
with inherent safety and reactor designs with engineered safety are shown.

Notes: 
1. for accident scenarios with slow or no power increase, two-parameter trip coverage should be 
demonstrated if practicable 
2. or scenarios where analysis is being performed not to demonstrate trip coverage, but to 
provide support such as environmental qualification (EQ) room conditions analysis for 
equipment survivability, a backup trip parameter is demonstrated only if practicable  
A manual reactor trip can be considered to be equivalent to a trip parameter if: the requirements 
for crediting operator action from the main control room are met (see subsection 4.4.4.5); and the 
reliability of manual shutdown meets the reliability requirements for an automatic trip.

Guidance for emergency core cooling system 
If the emergency core cooling system (ECCS) logic has an injection logic conditioned by the 
presence of other indicators (i.e., conditioning signal), then the safety analysis should identify and 
evaluate the consequences of situations where those conditioning signals may be blinded. 
If the ECCS activation logic is complex (i.e., several different actions are required for the system 
to be considered fully activated), then the safety analysis should consider the consequences if 
some of these actions do not occur – for example, a failure to re-align the ECCS pump suction to 
the containment sump. 
For certain designs, the following considerations should be taken into account:  
• 
the potential for gas entrainment that could result in damage due to the occurrence of water 
hammer 
• 
the impact on recirculation flows in the presence of filter plugging, debris blockage, heat 
exchanger blockage, or pump cavitations 
• 
the effect of non-condensable gases on flow and heat transfer 
The safety analysis should consider the impact on the effectiveness of the ECCS of the inaction, 
partial action, and normal functioning of any other systems that supplement or degrade the 
cooling capability of the ECCS. 
Guidance for containment 
The deterministic safety analysis should identify and evaluate consequences of situations when 
the containment isolation instrumentation is blinded. For containment, “blinded” refers to 
conditions for which a containment isolation actuation set point is approached, but not reached. 
For example, the containment may be blinded by the inaction, partial action, or normal 
functioning of other systems that supplement or degrade the containment performance. 
Containment blinding scenarios are important, because an accident with a potential for 
radioactivity release may not trigger the activation of containment isolation.  
The containment leakage rate assumed in the analysis should be based on containment design 
leak-tightness requirements, and confirmed by the leakage rate tests. 
Guidance for equipment under maintenance 
The analysis should account, where applicable, for the possibility of the equipment being taken 
out of service for maintenance.  
4.4.4.5 Guidance for operator action  
Specific operator actions required in response to an accident should be identified. Operator 
actions can be credited in the safety analysis for Level 3 defence in depth only if: 
• 
there is reliable instrumentation designed to provide clear and unambiguous indication of the 
need to take action 
• 
the power plant has operating procedures that identify the necessary actions, operator 
training, support personnel, spare parts, and equipment 
• 
environmental conditions do not prevent safe completion of operator actions 
 
32 
 
May 2014 
REGDOC-2.4.1, Deterministic Safety Analysis 
 
Following the first clear and unambiguous indication of the necessity for operator actions, such 
actions may normally be credited in the safety analysis (Level 3 defence in depth) to be started no 
sooner than: 
• 
15 minutes for actions in the main control room 
• 
30 minutes for actions outside the main control room   
Times for operator actions in new nuclear power plants are established in REGDOC-2.5.2, 
Design of Reactor Facilities: Nuclear Power Plants. 
Note: New nuclear power plants referenced in this section are those first licensed in 2014 and 
beyond. 
It should be shown by assessment that the specified times are sufficient for the operator to detect 
and completely diagnose the event, and to carry out the required actions. Such assessment should 
account for the following:  
• 
time starting from the occurrence of the initiating event to the receipt of the event indication 
by the operator 
• 
time to carry out the diagnosis  
• 
time required to perform the action 
• 
time for the safety related function to be completed 
In certain circumstances, which must be justified, a completion time shorter than 15 minutes for a 
control room action might be assumed, provided that: 
• 
the operator is exclusively focused on the action in question 
• 
the required action is unique, and does not involve a choice from several options 
• 
the required action is simple and does not involve multiple manipulations 
The assessment of the credited human action items should be formally documented. It should 
include a validation process, which can encompass: 
• 
documented procedures that define specific operator action entry points and actions 
• 
training of personnel on those procedures (training outline, materials, records) 
• 
performing station drills, exercises or control room simulator studies, to confirm that human 
actions can be completed and to assess response times 
• 
consideration of control room simulator data from training activities 
• 
analysis and assessment of the response times, to provide credible time estimates for safety 
analysis usage 
• 
validation reports  
4.4.4.6 Guidance for modelling assumptions  
The assumptions incorporated in the computer codes, or made during code applications, should 
be such that safety analysis results (whether best-estimate or conservative) remain physically 
sound.  
In performing safety analysis, justifications should be provided for all instances where the 
assumptions used are different than those used in the validation. 
 
33 
 
May 2014 
REGDOC-2.4.1, Deterministic Safety Analysis 
 
4.4.4.7 Guidance for dose calculations  
As mentioned in section 4.3, the committed whole-body dose for average members of the critical 
groups who are most at risk (at or beyond the site boundary) is calculated in the deterministic 
safety analysis for a period of 30 days after the analyzed event.  
The effective dose should be used in dose calculations, and should include contributions from:  
• 
external radiation from cloud and ground deposits 
• 
inhaled radioactive materials 
• 
skin absorption of tritium 
In dose calculations, the worst weather scenario in terms of predicted dose should be assumed. 
All weather scenarios with probabilities of occurrences higher than 5 percent should be accounted 
for.  
No intervention in the form of decontamination or evacuation should be assumed. Intervention 
against ingestion of radioactive materials and natural removal processes may be assumed.  
Dose calculations should also be conducted for several time intervals, and up to one year after the 
accident.  
4.4.5 Computer codes 
Computer codes used in the safety analysis shall be developed, validated, and used in accordance 
with a quality assurance program that meets the requirements of CSA N286.7-99, Quality 
Assurance of Analytical, Scientific, and Design Computer Programs for Nuclear Power Plants. 
Guidance 
The use of realistic computer codes in safety analysis is preferable, given that the use of 
conservative codes may produce misleading or unrealistic results. However, an extensive 
experimental database should be established to demonstrate the code applicability and to validate 
the code, thereby providing a basis for confidence in code predictions.  
Fully integrated models could give a more accurate representation of the event, and should be 
used to the extent practicable. These models address all important phenomena within a single 
code or code package. Sequential application of single-discipline codes is more likely to 
misrepresent feedback mechanisms than fully integrated models, and should be avoided unless 
there is a specific advantage. 
The selection of computer codes should consider the code applicability, the extent of code 
validation, and the ability to adequately represent the physical system. 
4.4.5.1 Guidance for computer code applicability 
For the safety analysis of an event, the applicability of computer codes used to predict the 
consequences is established before conducting the analysis. The demonstration of code 
applicability includes the following steps: 
• 
identification of all phenomena significantly influencing the key output parameters (see 
section 4.4.2.3) 
 
34 
 
May 2014 
REGDOC-2.4.1, Deterministic Safety Analysis 
 
• 
confirmation that the code implements adequate models for all key phenomena, and 
demonstrating that these models have been verified and validated against separate effect tests  
• 
assessing the closure equations and constitutive relationships 
• 
assessing scaling effects; the scalability of the integral effects tests should be assessed to 
confirm that there is no significant distortion in the database; scaling distortions and their 
impact on the code assessment should be identified, evaluated and addressed in the safety 
analysis 
• 
assessing the numerical stability of calculations and temporal and spatial convergence of 
iterative approximations; the spatial and temporal convergence are achieved when an increase 
or a reduction in the node or time step sizes (which includes changing the minimum time 
step, if necessary) does not change simulation results significantly 
• 
addressing any gaps or deficiencies in the code applicability for the analyzed event 
The code applicability assessment and relevant knowledge bases are documented in sufficient 
detail to allow for an independent review. 
To model behaviour involving many coupled phenomena, it should be demonstrated that data are 
transferred through interfaces (i.e., from the calculation of one phenomenon to another) in a 
manner which adequately captures the physical phenomena and feedback mechanisms. 
4.4.5.2 Guidance for code validation and quantification of accuracy  
This document requires all computer codes to be validated for their application in safety analysis. 
The purpose of validation is to provide confidence in the ability of a code for a given application, 
and also to determine the code accuracy.  
The validation should: 
• 
demonstrate the capability and credibility of a computer code for use in specific analysis 
application 
• 
quantify the accuracy of the code calculations (quantified through comparison of code 
prediction with experimental data or other known solutions) 
The codes used in safety analysis are validated by comparing code predictions with: 
• 
experimental data 
• 
commissioning data and operating data, where available 
• 
solutions to standard or benchmark problems 
• 
closed mathematical solutions  
• 
results of another validated computer program 
The comparison of code predictions with solutions to standard problems or closed mathematical 
solutions for the purposes of validation is acceptable, but they should normally be supplemented 
with other types of comparisons. 
The experimental database used for validation may encompass separate effects, as well as 
component and integrated tests. Chosen test validation should satisfy the following criteria:  
• 
test data are obtained at physical and geometrical conditions and phenomena that are relevant 
either to normal operation conditions, or to a postulated accident scenario in the reactor 
 
35 
 
May 2014 
REGDOC-2.4.1, Deterministic Safety Analysis 
 
• 
tests used for validation are free of distortions due to geometry or other properties, to the 
extent practicable 
• 
measurement uncertainties are quantified 
• 
systematic errors (bias) are minimized, and their sources are understood 
• 
the integrated tests used for validation should be specific to the reactor, and contain 
components representative of those used in the NPPs 
• 
data used for model development is independent from data used for computer code validation 
Accuracy of code predictions should be provided for the key modelling parameters, and for the 
plant parameters used to control power generation or to initiate a mitigating system (see 
section 4.4.2.7). 
The bias and variability of bias in the computer code can be obtained from the comparison of 
code predictions with experimental data. 
The code models used during validation should be identified and recommended for use in safety 
analysis, so that the safety analysis is consistent with the validation. Otherwise, the impact of 
using different models on the simulation results (code accuracy) should be assessed.  
Clear recommendations should be made on the use of a code beyond the conditions for which 
validation has been performed, and all the effects of such extrapolations should be assessed and 
accounted for.  
The effect of the modelling assumptions on the validation results should be assessed, including 
confirmation that a spatial and temporal convergence of the solution is achieved.  
Documentation of the computer tools should be clear and easy to follow, so the uncertainties due 
to user effects would be negligible. The use of different computer hardware or operating systems 
should also have negligible effects. Means such as user training and compliance with quality 
assurance procedures should be clearly stated. 
Computer code validation should be performed by qualified persons. Validation reports should be 
reviewed by qualified persons who had not participated in the validation.  
The guidance given above is consistent with and complements the requirements in 
CSA N286.7-99, Quality Assurance of Analytical, Scientific, and Design Computer Programs for 
Nuclear Power Plants. 
4.4.5.3 Guidance for physical representations 
Data are also prepared to provide a mathematical representation of the physical components, and 
how their arrangements are to be represented by the computer simulation. This input data should 
be prepared in accordance with the following principles: 
• 
a systematic method for representing components and connections should be developed 
• 
the basis for the methodology should be documented; the methods used are usually based on 
experience in representing experimental facilities and other plants of similar configurations 
• 
the representation should be verified and validated 
• 
in some cases, plant tests (sometimes as commissioning tests) are required to establish the 
precision of such representations 
 
36 
 
May 2014 
REGDOC-2.4.1, Deterministic Safety Analysis 
 
In general, representations used for plant simulations should be created using the same principles 
as the representation used for code validation to minimize the related user effects.  
4.4.6 Conservatism in deterministic safety analysis 
The safety analysis shall build in a degree of conservatism to off-set any uncertainties associated 
with both NPP initial and boundary conditions and modelling of NPP performance in the 
analyzed event. This conservatism shall depend on event class and shall be commensurate with 
the analysis objectives. 
Guidance 
Safety analysis needs to incorporate a degree of conservatism that is commensurate with the 
safety analysis objectives and is dependent on the event class. Conservatism in safety analysis is 
often necessary to cover the potential impact of uncertainties, and may be achieved through 
judicious application of conservative assumptions and data. 
The concept of conservatism is applied to Level 3 defence-in-depth safety analysis. This is to 
ensure that limiting assumptions are used when knowledge of the physical phenomena is 
insufficient.  
For Level 2 and Level 4 defence in depth, the safety analysis should be carried out using 
best-estimate assumptions, data and methods. Where this is not possible, a reasonable degree of 
conservatism (appropriate for the objectives of these levels) should be used, to compensate for the 
lack of adequate knowledge concerning the physical processes governing these events.  
While it is permissible – and sometimes encouraged – to use conservative codes, it is usually 
preferable to apply realistic (best-estimate) computer codes. Where conservative analysis results 
are required for Level 3 defence-in-depth (AOO and DBA) analysis, best-estimate computer 
codes should be used along with the assessment of modelling and input plant parameter 
uncertainties.  
The deterministic safety analysis for AOO and DBA (conservative analysis for Level 3 defence in 
depth) should: 
• 
apply the single-failure criterion to all safety groups, and ensure that the safety groups are 
environmentally and seismically qualified 
• 
use minimum allowable performance (as established in the OLCs) for safety groups 
• 
account for consequential failures that may occur as a result of the initiating event 
• 
credit the actions of process and control systems only where the systems are passive and 
environmentally and seismically qualified for the accident conditions 
• 
include the actions of process and control systems when their actions may have a detrimental 
effect on the consequences of the analyzed accident  
• 
credit the normally running process systems that are not affected by the analyzed accident 
• 
if operator actions are credited, demonstrate that credible “worst case” operator performance 
has been considered in the analysis and assessment  
Independent selection of all parameters at their conservative values can lead to plant states that 
are not physically feasible. When this could be the case, it is recommended to select 
conservatively those key parameters that have the strongest influence on the results in comparison 
with the acceptance criterion under consideration. The remaining parameters can be specified 
 
37 
 
May 2014 
REGDOC-2.4.1, Deterministic Safety Analysis 
 
more consistently in the ensuing calculations. Each calculation should account for the impact of a 
particular parameter, so that the effects of all parameters can be assessed. 
4.5 
Deterministic safety analysis documentation 
The safety analysis documentation shall be comprehensive and sufficiently detailed to allow for a 
conclusive review. The document shall include: 
1. the technical basis for the analyzed event and key phenomena and processes 
2. A description of the analyzed facility, including important systems and their performance, as 
well as operator actions 
3. information describing the analysis method and assumptions 
4. a description of the assessments of code applicability for the analyzed event and computer 
code uncertainty 
5. an easily understood description of the results of the analysis, and the drawing of conclusions 
with respect to conformance with acceptance criteria 
Analysis documentation shall facilitate the update of the analysis when new results become 
available. 
Guidance 
The review should be an independent review and conducted by suitably qualified experts. In 
particular, the following elements need to be included in the safety analysis documentation: 
• 
a technical basis that includes: 
o 
the objective(s) of the analysis 
o 
a description of the analyzed event, which should include a description of the NPP 
operating mode, action of SSCs, operator actions and significant phases of the analyzed 
event (note that other events bounded by the analyzed event should also be identified) 
o 
a description of safety concerns, challenges to safety, and applicable safety analysis 
criteria, requirements and numerical limits 
o 
identification of key phenomena significantly affected by the key parameters for the 
analyzed event, along with a description of the systematic process used for identification 
of key parameters 
• 
a description of the analyzed facility, including important systems and their performance, as 
well as operators actions 
• 
information on the analysis method and assumptions 
• 
information demonstrating the code applicability, including (when available) evidence that 
codes have been validated against prototypical experiments and assessment of code accuracy, 
as well as references to the relevant experimental results; demonstration that the analysis 
assumptions are consistent with the plant operating limits (with evidence from NPP operation 
and experiments demonstrating the assumed observed variances in operating parameters, and 
uncertainties in modelling parameters, respectively) 
• 
a description of the results of analysis, including results of sensitivity and uncertainty studies 
with sufficient detail to show dominant phenomena; evidence of independent verification of 
the inputs and the results; evidence of analysis review, including an assessment of the impact 
(if any) on the plant’s operating limits, conditions, manuals, etc. 
Safety analysis documentation should be written in a manner that can be easily understood by the 
station staff controlling the plant’s OLCs.

REGDOC-2.4.1, Deterministic Safety Analysis 
 
4.6 
Review and update of deterministic safety analysis  
4.6.1 Review of deterministic safety analysis results 
The licensee shall systematically review the safety analysis results to ensure that they are correct 
and meet the objectives set for the analysis. The results shall be assessed against the relevant 
requirements, applicable experimental data, expert judgment, and comparison with similar 
calculations and sensitivity analyses. 
The licensee shall review the analysis results using one or more of the following techniques, 
depending on the objectives of the analysis: 
1. supervisory review 
2. peer review 
3. independent review by qualified individuals 
4. independent calculations using alternate tools and methods to the extent practicable 
Guidance 
Procedures should be developed to determine the extent of the independent review to be applied 
at each step of the safety analysis.  
To review the safety analysis and identify potential deficiencies, reviewers should be familiar 
with:  
• 
safety standards, analytical methods, and technical and scientific research 
• 
changes in power plant data, design, operating envelope and operating procedures 
• 
information on operating experience from other NPPs 
In reviewing the safety analysis, the following review elements should be considered: 
• 
plant design information, supported by layout, system and equipment drawings, and design 
manuals 
• 
operating limits and permitted operational states 
• 
information about the functional capability of the plant, systems and major items of 
equipment 
• 
the findings of tests which validate the functional capability 
• 
the results of inspection of components 
• 
site characteristics, such as flood, seismic, meteorological, and hydrological databases 
• 
offsite characteristics, including population densities 
• 
results of similar analyses 
• 
developments in analytical methods and computer codes 
• 
regulatory rules for safety analysis 
• 
safety analysis standards and procedures 
The extent and method of the review should be commensurate with: 
• 
the analysis complexity and novelty 
• 
similarity to previously reviewed analyses 
• 
predicted margins to acceptance criteria 
 
39 
 
May 2014 
REGDOC-2.4.1, Deterministic Safety Analysis 
 
For novel and complex analysis, the use of alternative methods should be considered to confirm 
analysis results. Alternative methods used for confirmation may be simplified, but should be 
capable of demonstrating that the original analysis results are reasonable. 
4.6.2 Update of deterministic safety analysis 
The safety analysis shall be periodically reviewed and updated to account for changes in NPP 
configuration, conditions (including those due to aging), operating parameters and procedures, 
research findings, and advances in knowledge and understanding of physical phenomena, in 
accordance with CNSC regulatory standard S-99, Reporting Requirements for Operating Nuclear 
Power Plants, or successor documents.  
In addition to periodic updates, the safety analysis shall also be updated following the discovery 
of information that may reveal a hazard that is different in nature, greater in probability, or greater 
in magnitude than was previously presented to the CNSC in the licensing documents. 
Guidance 
The periodic update of the safety analysis report should: 
• 
incorporate new information 
• 
address identified new issues 
• 
use current tools and methods 
• 
address the impact of modifications to the design and operating procedures that might happen 
over the life of the NPP 
Updating the safety analysis ensures that it remains valid, while taking into account: 
• 
the actual status of the NPP 
• 
permitted plant configuration and allowable operating conditions 
• 
predicted plant end-of-life state  
• 
changes to analytical methods, safety standards and knowledge that invalidate existing safety 
analysis   
In order to achieve the above objective, the following guidelines can be used in updating safety 
analyses: 
• 
review safety analysis methods against the applicable standards, and research findings 
available in Canada and internationally, to identify the elements that should be taken into 
account 
• 
review the changes made in the NPP data, design, operating envelope, and operating 
procedure, to identify the elements that need to be updated 
• 
review information on NPP commissioning and operating experience, both in Canada and 
worldwide, to identify relevant information that should be accounted for  
• 
review the progress in the resolution of previously identified safety analysis issues, to identify 
the impact on the safety analysis methods and results 
4.7 
Quality of deterministic safety analysis 
Safety analysis shall be subject to a comprehensive QA program applied to all activities affecting 
the quality of the results. The QA program shall identify the management system or quality 
 
40 
 
May 2014 
REGDOC-2.4.1, Deterministic Safety Analysis 
 
assurance standards to be applied and shall include documented procedures and instructions for 
the complete safety analysis process, including, but not limited to: 
1. collection and verification of NPP data 
2. verification of the computer input data 
3. validation of NPP and analytical models 
4. assessment of simulation results 
5. documentation of analysis results 
Guidance 
All sources of data should be referenced and documented, and the various steps of the process 
should be recorded and archived, to allow independent checking. 
The safety analysis QA program should comply with regulatory requirements, codes and 
standards, and be consistent with the best international practices.

Part II: Deterministic Safety Analysis for Small Reactor Facilities 
5. 
Introduction 
Part II of this regulatory document sets out the requirements of the Canadian Nuclear Safety 
Commission (CNSC) for deterministic safety analysis for small reactor facilities. 
6. 
Graded Approach 
The graded approach is a method in which the stringency of the design measures and analyses 
applied are commensurate with the level of risk posed by the reactor facility. 
The breadth and depth of analyses and magnitude of accepted uncertainties in the safety analyses 
shall demonstrate that the safety analysis objectives and the requirements in this document are 
met. 
Licensees or applicants may find further guidance on use of the graded approach in International 
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) NS-R-4, Safety of Research Reactors. 
6.1 
Application of the graded approach to deterministic safety analysis 
The scope, content and detail of the safety analysis for small reactor facilities may not be the 
same as for power reactors. Different accident scenarios may apply and some scenarios may need 
only a limited safety analysis. The application of the graded approach to safety analysis shall be 
commensurate with the level of risk of the reactor facility. 
When a graded approach is applied, factors to be considered include: 
1. reactor power 
2. reactor safety characteristics 
3. amount and enrichment of fissile and fissionable material 
4. fuel design 
5. type and mass of moderator, reflector and coolant 
6. utilization of the reactor 
7. presence of high-energy sources and other radioactive and hazardous sources 
8. safety design features 
9. source term 
10. siting 
11. proximity to populated areas 
7. 
Deterministic Safety Analysis 
The overall assessment of the reactor facility design includes hazards analysis, deterministic 
safety analysis and probabilistic safety analysis techniques. This document focuses on 
deterministic safety analysis. 
These analyses identify all radiation sources, in order to evaluate potential radiation doses to 
reactor facility workers and to the public, and to evaluate potential effects on the environment. 
 
42 
 
May 2014 
REGDOC-2.4.1, Deterministic Safety Analysis 
 
These analyses confirm that the design is capable of meeting the safety requirements, dose 
acceptance criteria and safety goals. These analyses also contribute to demonstrating that the 
reactor facility provides defence in depth (as defined in RD-367, Design of Small Reactor 
Facilities). 
The safety analyses shall: 
1. confirm the assumptions and intent of the design for normal operation of the reactor facility 
to establish the operational limits and conditions (OLCs) of the reactor facility, to assist in 
establishing and validating accident management procedures and guidelines 
2. characterize the events that are applicable to the site and reactor facility design (as described 
in section 8.2) 
3. analyze and evaluate event sequences that result from failure of structures, systems and 
components (SSCs) 
4. compare the results of the safety analyses with design limits and dose acceptance criteria 
5. confirm the range of conditions and events taken into account in the design basis 
6. demonstrate that anticipated operational occurrences (AOOs), design-basis accidents (DBAs) 
and, to the extent practicable, beyond-design-basis accidents (BDBAs) can be managed by 
automatic response of safety systems in combination with operating procedures 
7.1 
Deterministic safety analysis objectives 
The deterministic safety analysis shall: 
1. confirm that the design of a reactor facility meets design and safety requirements and the 
applicable requirements for defence in depth established in RD-367; in particular, the 
deterministic safety analysis shall: 
a. demonstrate Level 2 defence in depth by providing reasonable confidence that control 
systems acting alone can mitigate a wide range of AOOs without damage to SSCs 
b. demonstrate Level 3 defence in depth by providing high confidence that the safety 
systems acting alone can mitigate all AOOs and DBAs such that the facility meets the 
dose acceptance criteria established in RD-367 
c. assist in demonstrating Level 4 defence in depth by supporting probabilistic safety 
analysis to demonstrate that facility meets the safety goals established in RD-367 
2. derive or confirm OLCs that are consistent with the design and safety requirements for the 
reactor facility 
3. assist in establishing and validating accident management procedures and guidelines 
4. confirm that modifications to the design or operation of the reactor facility have no 
significant adverse impact on safety 
8. 
Requirements for Deterministic Safety Analysis  
The following sections outline the detailed requirements of the deterministic safety analysis that 
must be submitted to the CNSC. 
 
43 
 
May 2014 
REGDOC-2.4.1, Deterministic Safety Analysis 
 
8.1 
Responsibilities 
The licensee or applicant is responsible for ensuring that the deterministic safety analysis meets 
the following requirements. The licensee or applicant shall: 
1. maintain adequate capability to either perform deterministic safety analysis or competently 
oversee deterministic safety analysis by an external resource 
2. ensure that a formal process is followed to assess and update a deterministic safety analysis, 
taking into account the impact of design modifications, operational experience, research 
findings and known safety issues 
3. ensure that a documented quality assurance (QA) process is applied in conducting a 
deterministic safety analysis 
8.2 
Events to be analyzed 
8.2.1 Identifying events 
The licensee or applicant shall use a systematic process to identify postulated initiating events 
(including criticality events), event sequences and event combinations (referred to as “events” 
hereafter in this document) that can potentially challenge the safety functions of the reactor 
facility. This process must consider regulatory requirements and guidance, past licensing 
precedents, operational experience, engineering judgment, results of deterministic analysis and 
probabilistic safety assessment (PSA), and a systematic review of the design. 
The licensee shall also identify events that may lead to fission product releases, including those 
related to spent fuel pools (also called irradiated fuel bays) and fuel-handling systems.  
The identification of events shall account for: 
1. all operating configurations, such as start-up, at-power operation, shutdown, maintenance, 
testing, surveillance, and refuelling 
2. configurations and uses of the reactor facility 
3. interactions between the reactor and any experimental devices, including: 
a. administrative procedures 
b. controls 
c. additional equipment related to the experimental devices 
Common-cause events affecting multiple reactor units on a site, or a reactor unit and related 
facilities nearby, shall be considered. 
The list of identified events shall be reviewed for completeness during the design and 
deterministic safety analysis process. After construction of a new reactor facility, the list of events 
shall be verified for the “as-built” state. Subsequent design changes or experiment designs shall 
also be reviewed and the list of identified events modified as necessary. 
8.2.2 Scope of events analyzed 
The list of events to be developed for the deterministic safety analysis shall include: 
1. failures or malfunctions of SSCs 
2. operator errors 
 
44 
 
May 2014 
REGDOC-2.4.1, Deterministic Safety Analysis 
 
3. common-cause failures initiated by internal and external events, including those affecting 
multiple reactor units on a site 
A cut-off frequency shall be selected such that the events with a frequency of occurrence less than 
the cut-off limit provide only a negligible contribution to the risk. Events of lower frequency than 
the cut-off limit are not considered to be credible. The elimination of such events from the 
deterministic safety analysis scope shall be justified, and the reasons for eliminating them must be 
documented. 
8.2.3 Classification of events 
The identified events shall be classified, based on the results of PSA and engineering judgment, 
into the following three classes of events: 
1. anticipated operational occurrences (AOOs), which include all events with frequencies of 
occurrence equal to or greater than 10-2 per reactor year 
2. design-basis accidents (DBAs), which include all events with frequencies of occurrence equal 
to or greater than 10-5 per reactor year but less than 10-2 per reactor year. This class of events 
also includes any events that are used as a design basis for a safety system, regardless of 
whether the estimated frequencies are less than 10-5 per reactor year. 
3. beyond-design-basis accidents (BDBAs), which include events with frequencies of 
occurrence less than 10-5 per reactor year 
Events with a frequency near the threshold between two classes of events, or with substantial 
uncertainty over the predicted event frequency, should be classified into a higher frequency class. 
Credible common cause events shall also be classified within the AOO, DBA and BDBA classes.

the Radiation Protection Regulations 
2. releases of radioactive materials into the environment are within the regulatory limits 
8.3.2 Anticipated operational occurrences and design-basis accidents 
Safety analysis for AOOs and DBAs shall demonstrate that: 
1. radiological doses to members of the public do not exceed the dose acceptance criteria as

REGDOC-2.4.1, Deterministic Safety Analysis 
 
8.3.3 Beyond-design-basis accidents 
Safety analysis for BDBAs shall demonstrate that: 
1. the reactor facility, as designed, is capable of meeting the safety goals as established in 
RD-367 
2. the procedures and equipment put in place to take accident management needs into account 
are effective, considering the availability of cooling water, material and power supplies; 
consideration can be given to the plant’s full design capabilities, including the possible use of 
safety, non-safety and temporary systems beyond their originally intended function  
Note that deterministic safety analysis supports PSA in evaluating the reactor facility against the 
safety goals. 
8.3.4 
Application of safety requirements for anticipated operational occurrences and 
design-basis accidents 
Qualitative acceptance criteria shall be established for each AOO and DBA to confirm the 
effectiveness of reactor facility systems in maintaining the integrity of physical barriers against 
releases of radioactive material. These qualitative acceptance criteria shall: 
1. avoid the potential for consequential failures resulting from an initiating event 
2. maintain the SSCs in a configuration that permits the effective removal of residual heat 
3. prevent development of complex configurations or physical phenomena that cannot be: 
a. modelled with high confidence 
b. demonstrated with suitable experiments 
c. reliably bound by conservative assumptions 
4. be consistent with the design requirements for the reactor facility’s SSCs 
To demonstrate that the safety requirements are met, acceptance criteria for AOOs and DBAs 
shall be established by the licensee or applicant prior to performing the deterministic safety 
analysis. Such acceptance criteria shall ensure that the safety functions are met, justified and 
supported by appropriate evidence. 
Examples of acceptance criteria for AOOs and DBAs are provided in appendix C. Licence 
conditions may contain additional requirements to reflect events resulting from unique reactor 
facility design or experiments. 
The results of a deterministic safety analysis shall meet acceptance criteria, with sufficient 
margins to accommodate uncertainties associated with the deterministic safety analysis. 
The deterministic safety analysis shall include the event that poses the most challenges in meeting 
the acceptance criteria (i.e., the limiting event in an event category). 
8.4 
Methods and assumptions for deterministic safety analysis 
The deterministic safety analysis must demonstrate that acceptance criteria will be met. To 
provide adequate confidence in the results, the deterministic safety analysis shall: 
1. be performed in accordance with a QA process that meets the requirements specified in 
section 8.7 
2. be performed by qualified analysts 
 
46 
 
May 2014 
REGDOC-2.4.1, Deterministic Safety Analysis 
 
3. apply a systematic deterministic safety analysis method 
4. use verified and validated models and computer codes 
5. use justified assumptions 
6. be subjected to a review process 
8.4.1 Method for deterministic safety analysis  
The deterministic safety analysis method shall include: 
1. identifying the scenarios to be analyzed to attain the deterministic safety analysis objectives, 
including sensitivity cases 
2. identifying the applicable acceptance criteria and limits 
3. collecting the information that describes the analyzed reactor facility and its permissible 
operating modes 
4. defining the assumptions about the operating state, the availability and performance of reactor 
facility systems, and the actions of operators 
5. identifying the important phenomena of the analyzed event 
6. selecting the computational methods or computer codes, models and correlations that have 
been validated for the intended applications 
7. preparing the input data for the deterministic safety analysis 
8. conducting calculations, including: 
a. performing sensitivity analysis and identifying, where necessary, margins to cliff-edge 
effects 
b. analyzing the event from the initial steady state up to a predefined long-term stable 
state 
10. verifying the calculation results for physical and logical consistency 
11. processing and documenting results of the calculations to demonstrate conformance with the 
acceptance criteria and limits 
8.4.2 Assumptions for deterministic safety analysis  
Deterministic safety analysis shall be based on complete and accurate reactor facility design and, 
where available, operational information. Assumptions made to simplify the deterministic safety 
analysis, as well as assumptions concerning the availability and performance of the systems and 
operators, shall be identified and justified. 
The deterministic safety analysis for AOOs and DBAs (conservative analysis for level 3 defence 
in depth) shall: 
1. incorporate the key input modelling parameter uncertainties, the key input plant parameters 
measurement uncertainties, and the measurement uncertainties for the actuation of mitigating 
systems; the uncertainties shall be properly estimated, following best national and 
international practices 
2. apply the single-failure criterion to all safety, groups and ensure that the safety groups are 
environmentally qualified 
3. use minimum allowable performance (as established in the OLCs) for safety groups 
4. account for consequential failures that may occur as a result of the initiating event 
5. credit the actions of process and control systems only where the systems are passive and 
environmentally qualified for the accident conditions 
6. credit process systems only if they are already running and are not affected by the event 
7. include the actions of process and control systems when their actions may have a detrimental 
effect on the consequences of the analyzed accident 
 
47 
 
May 2014 
REGDOC-2.4.1, Deterministic Safety Analysis 
 
8. consider the effects of aging on SSCs 
9. account for the possibility of equipment being taken out of service for maintenance 
10. show that the plant can be maintained in a stable, cold and depressurized state for a prolonged 
period 
11. credit operator actions only when there are: 
a. unambiguous indications of the need for such actions 
b. adequate procedures and operator training for such actions 
c. sufficient time to perform the credited actions 
d. environmental conditions that do not prohibit such actions 
8.4.3 Computer codes 
Computer codes used in the deterministic safety analysis shall be developed, validated and used 
in accordance with a quality assurance program that meets or exceeds the CSA Group standard 
CSA-N286.7-99. G-149, Computer Programs Used in Design and Safety Analyses of Nuclear 
Power Plants and Research Reactors, provides guidance on computer code expectations. 
8.4.4 Conservatism in deterministic safety analysis 
A degree of conservatism shall be incorporated in the analysis, to demonstrate a level of 
confidence in conformance with the analysis objectives (established in accordance with 
section 7.1). 
8.5

The deterministic safety analysis documentation shall be comprehensive and sufficiently detailed 
to allow for an independent verification. The documentation shall include: 
1. the objective of the safety analysis 
2. the technical basis for each event, and key phenomena and processes 
3. a description of the analyzed event 
4. a description of safety concerns, challenges to safety, and applicable safety criteria, 
requirements and numerical limits 
5. identification of key phenomena taking place during the analyzed event for each of the 
identified safety concerns 
6. demonstration of the code applicability, including evidence that codes have been validated 
against prototypical experiments and assessment of the code accuracy 
7. demonstration that the analysis assumptions are consistent with the reactor facility operating 
limits 
8. the results of sensitivity analysis and uncertainty analysis 
9. the data and information to be provided to other programs at the reactor facility 
10. a summary of significant results and conclusions regarding acceptability 
8.6 
Review and update of deterministic safety analysis 
8.6.1 Review of deterministic safety analysis results 
The licensee or applicant shall systematically review the deterministic safety analysis results, to 
ensure that they are correct and meet the initial objective of the deterministic safety analysis. The 
results shall be assessed against the relevant CNSC requirements, applicable experimental data, 
expert judgment, comparison with similar calculations and sensitivity analyses. 
 
48 
 
May 2014 
REGDOC-2.4.1, Deterministic Safety Analysis 
 
The licensee or applicant shall review the deterministic safety analysis results using one or more 
of the following techniques, depending on the objectives of the deterministic safety analysis: 
1. supervisory review 
2. peer review 
3. independent review by qualified individuals 
4. independent calculations using alternate tools and methods to the extent practicable 
8.6.2 Update of deterministic safety analysis 
The deterministic safety analysis shall be periodically reviewed and updated to account for 
changes in the reactor facility configuration, conditions (including those due to aging), operating 
parameters and procedures, new research findings, and advances in knowledge. The graded 
approach applies to the frequency of updates. 
In addition to periodic updates, the deterministic safety analysis shall also be updated when there 
are major design changes, and/or refurbishments or both. It shall also be updated following the 
discovery of information that may reveal a hazard that is significantly different in nature, greater 
in probability or greater in magnitude than was previously presented to the CNSC in the licensing 
documents. Such information includes: 
1. changes due to new research findings 
2. the occurrence of an event that was not considered in the deterministic safety analysis 
8.7 
Quality of deterministic safety analysis 
Deterministic safety analysis shall be subjected to a comprehensive QA program that is applied to 
all activities affecting the quality of the results. The QA program shall identify the quality 
assurance standards to be applied and shall include documented procedures and instructions for 
the complete deterministic safety analysis process, including, but not limited to: 
1. collection and verification of reactor facility data 
2. verification of the computer input data 
3. validation of codes used in deterministic safety analysis 
4. assessment of results of simulations 
5. documentation of deterministic safety analysis results

Appendix B: Examples of Derived Acceptance Criteria for Nuclear Power Plants 
In accordance with this document, section 4.3.4, the licensee is to establish derived acceptance criteria. 
The examples below are obtained from current Canadian and international practice. 
B.1 
Anticipated operational occurrences  
The overall criteria for an anticipated operational occurrence (AOO) are as follows (see REGDOC-2.5.2, 
Design of Reactor Facilities: Nuclear Power Plants):  
• 
the dose acceptance criterion for an AOO is met 
• 
SSCs that are not involved in initiating the event are to remain fit for continued operation 
REGDOC-2.5.2, Design of Reactor Facilities: Nuclear Power Plants, states expectations that the 
majority of AOOs will be mitigated by the control systems and will not need the action of the safety 
systems to prevent damage.  
Additionally, all AOOs should be mitigated by the safety systems, with no assistance from the control 
systems. Only the criteria that show successful mitigation by the safety systems are shown here, in 
table B.1. 
B.2 
Design-basis accidents 
The overall criteria for a design-basis accident (DBA) are as follows: 
• 
the dose acceptance criterion for a DBA is met 
• 
the event does not progress to more severe conditions 
Section 4.3.4 of this document states the following general principles to be met by derived acceptance 
criteria: 
• 
avoid the potential for consequential failures resulting from an initiating event 
• 
maintain the SSCs in a configuration that permits the effective removal of residual heat 
• 
prevent development of complex configurations or physical phenomena that cannot be 
modelled with high confidence 
• 
be consistent with the design requirements for the plant’s SSCs 
Table B.2 provides examples of DBA acceptance criteria.

Glossary 
acceptance criteria 
Specified bounds on the value of a functional indicator or condition indicator used to assess the ability of 
a structure, system or component to meet its design and safety requirements. 
acceptance parameter  
A plant parameter that characterizes plant response and has a defined acceptance criterion as a limit for 
the acceptable range of values.  
accident 
Any unintended event (including operating errors, equipment failures or other mishaps) the consequences 
or potential consequences of which are not negligible from the point of view of protection or safety.  
Note: For the purposes of this document, accidents include design-basis accidents and beyond-design-
basis accidents. Accidents exclude anticipated operational occurrences, which have negligible 
consequences from the perspective of protection or safety. 
anticipated operational occurrence  
An operational process deviating from normal operation that is expected to occur once or several times 
during the operating lifetime of the reactor facility but that – in view of the appropriate design provisions 
– does not cause significant damage to items important to safety or lead to accident conditions. 
best estimate

realistically predict behaviour and important parameters. 
best-estimate method 
A method designed to give realistic results. 
beyond-design-basis accident (BDBA) 
An accident less frequent than a design-basis-accident. A beyond-design-basis accident may or may not 
involve core degradation. 
bias  
Uncertainty arising from a systematic error that is known to cause deviation in a fixed direction. 
blinding  
Conditions for which an actuation or conditioning signal is approached but not reached, either because of 
the small magnitude of the initiating event or the actions of other process or safety systems. 
bounding event 
The event with the smallest predicted margin to a specific acceptance criterion.  
Class I nuclear facility 
A Class IA or Class IB nuclear facility, as described in the Class I Nuclear Facilities Regulations. 
cliff-edge effect 
A small change of conditions that may lead to a catastrophic increase in the severity of consequences. 
Note: Cliff-edge effects can be caused by changes in any of the following: characteristics of the 
environment; the event; or the plant response.

of bias of a computer code that are derived from the comparison of code predictions with experimental 
data. 
common-cause failure 
A concurrent failure of two or more structures, systems or components due to a single specific event or 
cause, such as natural phenomena (earthquakes, tornadoes, floods, etc.), design deficiency, manufacturing 
flaws, operation and maintenance errors, and human-induced destructive events.

A continuous boundary without openings or penetrations and that prevents the release of radioactive 
materials out of the enclosed space. 
conservatism 
Use of assumptions, based on experience or indirect information, about a phenomena or behaviour of a 
system being at or near the limit of expectation, which increases safety margins or makes predictions 
regarding consequences more severe than if best-estimate assumptions had been made. 
conservative method 
A method deliberately leading to results that are intended to be limiting relative to specified acceptance 
criteria. 
containment

for which damage to the fuel and the release of radioactive material are kept within authorized limits. 
deterministic safety analysis 
An analysis of a reactor facility’s response to an event performed using predetermined rules and 
assumptions (e.g., those concerning the initial facility operational state, availability and performance of 
the facility systems and operator actions). Deterministic safety analysis can use conservative or best-
estimate methods.

facility, including activities during design, construction, and commissioning, operation, maintenance and 
decommissioning phases.

probabilistic safety assessment (PSA) 
A comprehensive and integrated assessment of the safety of the reactor facility. The safety assessment 
considers the probability, progression and consequences of equipment failures or transient conditions, to 
derive numerical estimates that provide a consistent measure of the safety of the reactor facility, as 
follows: 
• 
A level 1 PSA identifies and quantifies the sequences of events that may lead to the loss of core 
structural integrity and massive fuel failures 
• 
A level 2 PSA starts from the level 1 results, analyzes the containment behaviour, evaluates the 
radionuclides released from the failed fuel, and quantifies the releases to the environment 
• 
A level 3 PSA starts from the level 2 results , analyzes the distribution of radionuclides in the 
environment and evaluates the resulting effect on public health 
Note: A PSA may also be referred to as a probabilistic risk assessment
