Preface 
This regulatory document is part of the CNSC’s safety analysis series of regulatory documents, which 
also covers deterministic safety analysis and probabilistic safety assessment. The full list of regulatory 
document series is included at the end of this document and can also be found on the CNSC’s website. 
Regulatory document REGDOC-2.4.3, Nuclear Criticality Safety, sets out requirements for nuclear 
criticality safety and provides guidance on how those requirements may be met. It provides information 
for the prevention of criticality accidents in the handling, storage, processing and transportation of 
fissionable materials and the long-term management of nuclear waste. 
This document clarifies the minimum physical constraints and limits on fissionable materials in order to 
ensure nuclear criticality safety during the construction, operation, decommissioning, or abandonment of 
the licensed facility and with respect to the handling, storing, processing and transportation of certain 
fissionable materials. It applies to operations with fissionable materials outside nuclear reactors, except 
for the assembly of these materials under controlled conditions (such as in critical experiments). 
Key principles and elements used in developing this document are consistent with national and 
international standards. Some sections of this document are extracted from certain standards from the 
American National Standards Institute (ANSI), with permission of the publisher, the American Nuclear 
Society (ANS). Where necessary, the text has been adapted to make it applicable to Canada’s 
international obligations to the International Atomic Energy Agency and consistent with CNSC’s 
regulatory requirements. 
This document is Version 1.1. It supersedes Version 1, which was published in February 2019. A 
document that shows the changes made to REGDOC-2.4.3, Version 1 is available from the CNSC upon 
request. 
For information on the implementation of regulatory documents in the licensing basis, and on the graded 
approach, see REGDOC-3.5.3, Regulatory Fundamentals. 
The words “shall” and “must” are used to express requirements to be satisfied by the licensee or

Introduction 
1.1 
Purpose 
This regulatory document sets out requirements for nuclear criticality safety and provides 
guidance on how those requirements may be met. It provides information for the prevention of 
criticality accidents in the handling, storage, processing, and transportation of fissionable 
materials and the long-term management of nuclear waste. 
1.2 
Scope 
This document clarifies the minimum physical constraints and limits on fissionable materials in 
order to ensure nuclear criticality safety during the construction, operation, decommissioning, or 
abandonment of the licensed facility and with respect to the handling, storing, processing and 
transportation of certain fissionable materials. 
This document also provides guidance on how requirements for nuclear criticality safety may be 
met. The information set out in this document applies to operations with fissionable materials 
outside nuclear reactors, except for the assembly of these materials under controlled conditions 
(such as in critical experiments). 
Note: In the context of nuclear criticality safety, the term “water” refers to light water unless 
otherwise noted. Where the term “ordinary water” is used in the chemical context, it refers to 
light water.

Nuclear Criticality Safety in Operations with Fissionable Materials Outside 
Reactors 
Some parts of this section are extracted from ANSI/ANS-8.1-2014, Nuclear Criticality Safety in 
Operations with Fissionable Materials Outside Reactors, with permission of the publisher, the 
American Nuclear Society. The text may have been adapted to make it applicable to Canada’s 
international obligations to IAEA and consistent with CNSC’s regulatory requirements. 
2.1 
Introduction 
Operations with some fissionable materials introduce risks of a criticality accident resulting in a 
release of radiation that can be lethal to nearby personnel. However, experience has shown that 
extensive operations can be performed safely and economically when proper precautions are 
exercised. The few criticality accidents that have occurred show frequency and severity rates far 
below those typical of non-nuclear accidents. 
This favourable record can be maintained only by continued adherence to good operating 
practices such as those embodied in this document; however, the document, by itself, cannot 
establish safe processes in an absolute sense. 
Good safety practices should recognize economic considerations, but the protection of operating 
personnel and the public must be the dominant consideration. 
2.2 
Scope 
Generalized basic criteria are presented and limits are specified for some single fissionable units 
of simple shape containing 233U, 235U, or 239Pu but not for multiunit arrays. 
Criteria are stated for establishing the validity and areas of applicability of any calculational 
method used in assessing nuclear criticality safety. 
This section does not include the details of administrative controls, the design of processes or 
equipment, the description of instrumentation for process control, nor detailed criteria to be met 
in transporting fissionable materials. 
2.3 
Nuclear criticality safety practices 
Operations with fissionable materials shall meet the requirements of this document and should 
follow the recommendations of this document. 
2.3.1 
Categorization of operations with fissionable materials 
2.3.1.1 Exempted quantity of fissionable materials 
An exempted quantity of fissionable materials in the licensed site is defined as an inventory of 
fissionable materials, as follows: 
1. less than 100 g of 233U, or 235U, or 239Pu, or of any combination of these three isotopes in 
fissionable material combined in any proportion; or 
2. an unlimited quantity of natural or depleted uranium or natural thorium, if no other 
fissionable materials nor significant quantities of graphite, heavy water, beryllium, or 
September 2020 
REGDOC-2.4.3, Nuclear Criticality Safety, Version 1.1 
 
 
6 
 
other moderators more effective than light water are allowed in the licensed site (Note: 
see section 11.3 for additional information on short- or interim-term storage [dry or wet] 
of spent fuel); or 
3. less than 200 kg in total of natural or depleted uranium or natural thorium if some other 
fissionable materials are present in the licensed site, but the total amount of fissile 
nuclides in those fissionable materials is less than 100 g 
Licensed sites with exempted quantities of fissionable materials are exempt from the 
requirements and recommendations of this document. 
2.3.1.2 Small quantity of fissionable materials 
A small quantity of fissionable materials in the licensed site is defined as an inventory of 
fissionable materials, which: 
1. exceeds the exempt limits listed in section 2.3.1.1; but 
2. does not exceed the following limits: 
 
500 g of 233U, or 700 g of 235U, or 450 g of 239Pu, or 450 g of any combination of 
these three isotopes. These limits apply to operations with plutonium, 233U, or 
uranium enriched in 233U or 235U. These limits do not apply if significant quantities of 
graphite, heavy water, beryllium, or other moderators more effective than light water 
are present; or 
 
80% of the appropriate smallest critical mass 
This document is partially applicable, as further specified in section 2.3.1.4, to licensed sites 
operating with small quantities of fissionable materials. 
2.3.1.3 Large quantity of fissionable materials 
A large quantity of fissionable materials in the licensed site is defined as an inventory of 
fissionable materials that exceeds the limits listed in section 2.3.1.2. 
This document is applicable to licensed sites operating with large quantities of fissionable 
materials. 
Note that a licensed site containing a large quantity of fissionable materials may be subject to the 
Nuclear Liability and Compensation Act. 
2.3.1.4 Nuclear criticality safety program relative to categorization 
A nuclear criticality safety program shall be developed and maintained in the licensed site to meet 
the CNSC nuclear criticality safety requirements and to support its safe operation. The extent of 
the program depends on the category of operations with fissionable materials: 
1. licensed sites involved in operations with small quantities of fissionable materials, as 
defined in section 2.3.1.2, shall develop and maintain a reduced-scope program based on 
the applicable sections of this document, taking into account that the requirements of 
sections 2.3.2.2, 2.3.2.9, 3, 11, 12.5, and 12.7 are not applicable. The program shall 
ensure that the entire process remains subcritical such that inadvertent criticality cannot 
occur. 
September 2020 
REGDOC-2.4.3, Nuclear Criticality Safety, Version 1.1 
 
 
7 
 
2. licensed sites involved in activities with large quantities of fissionable materials, as 
defined in section 2.3.1.3, shall develop and maintain a program based on the applicable 
sections of this document and the CNSC requirements. The contents of a program are 
described in section 12.8 of this document. 
Applicability of the criticality safety program to separate areas of the licensed site should be 
based on the categorizations in section 2.3.1. 
2.3.2 
Program practices 
2.3.2.1 Responsibilities 
Management shall clearly establish responsibility for nuclear criticality safety. Supervisors should 
be made as responsible for nuclear criticality safety as they are for production, development, 
research, or other functions. Each individual, regardless of position, shall be made aware that 
nuclear criticality safety in their work area is ultimately their responsibility. This may be 
accomplished through training and periodic retraining of all operating and support personnel. 
Nuclear criticality safety does not differ in any intrinsic way from industrial safety, and good 
managerial practices apply to both. 
Management shall provide personnel skilled in the interpretation of data pertinent to nuclear 
criticality safety, and familiar with operations, to serve as advisors to supervisors. These 
specialists should be, to the extent practicable, administratively independent of process 
supervisors. 
Management shall establish the criteria to be satisfied by nuclear criticality safety controls. 
Distinction may be made between shielded and unshielded facilities, and the criteria may be less 
stringent when adequate shielding and confinement assure the protection of personnel. 
2.3.2.2 Process analysis 
Before a new operation with fissionable material is begun, or before an existing operation is 
changed, it shall be determined that the entire process will be subcritical under both normal and 
credible abnormal conditions that have frequency of occurrence equal to or greater than 10-6 per 
year [5, 6]. Examples of such conditions are given in appendix A. 
1. An adequate upper subcritical limit (USL) shall be established and justified such that: 
 
if calculational methods are applied to predict neutron multiplication factors for 
safety assessment: 
i. 
the USL is calculated using the formulas presented in appendix B, and 
ii. 
a minimum administrative margin of subcriticality, as presented in the 
formulas for calculating the USL, is 5% in neutron multiplication 
factor [5, 6] 
 
if calculational methods are not applied to predict neutron multiplication factors for 
safety assessment: 
i. 
the USL is 500 g of 233U, or 700 g of 235U, or 450 g of 239Pu, or 450 g of any 
combination of these three isotopes. These limits shall be applied only when 
the surrounding materials, including other nearby fissionable materials, can 
be shown to increase the effective multiplication factor (keff) no more than it 
September 2020 
REGDOC-2.4.3, Nuclear Criticality Safety, Version 1.1 
 
 
8 
 
would be increased if the unit were enclosed by a contiguous layer of water 
of unlimited thickness; or 
ii. 
otherwise, the minimum administrative margin of subcriticality shall be 20% 
of the critical mass [5, 6] 
2. The established adequate USL shall be maintained under all normal and credible 
abnormal conditions, and: 
 
all credible abnormal conditions having frequency of occurrence equal to or more 
than 10-6/year are identified and assessed; and 
 
the frequency of occurrence for the identified credible abnormal conditions is clearly 
demonstrated using quantitative or semi-quantitative methods (see appendix G) 
3. It shall be demonstrated that adequate mitigation measures are in place such that off-site 
consequences of a representative nuclear criticality accident, as calculated from the start 
of the accident, do not violate criteria established as a trigger for a temporary public 
evacuation by the following international standard and national guidance [5, 6]: 
 
IAEA Safety Standards Series No. GS-R-2, Preparedness and Response for a 
Nuclear or Radiological Emergency, Safety Requirements, Annex III, 
Subsection III-2 [3] 
 
Health Canada, Canadian Guidelines for Intervention during a Nuclear Emergency, 
H46-2/03-326E [4] 
Note: A representative nuclear criticality accident is as defined in section 16.4. 
4. In item 3, above (the list of requirements to demonstrate the mitigation of off-site 
consequences of a representative nuclear criticality accident), the licensee may exclude 
any of the following independent sets of abnormal conditions: 
 
an external event that leads to a criticality accident with frequency of occurrence less 
than 10-7/year; or 
 
process deviations for which there is a convincing argument, given by physical laws, 
that they are not possible, or are unquestionably extremely unlikely; the validity of 
the argument must not depend on any feature of the design or materials controlled by 
the facility’s system of criticality safety controls, or management measures 
Considering the impact of external events on the facility, the frequency of occurrence of the 
impact should be calculated by evaluating the vulnerable impact areas; i.e., areas where 
fissionable materials are processed or stored. To evaluate the consequences of the impact or the 
adequacy of the design to resist the impact, only realistic impact scenarios should be considered, 
which might require the knowledge of various factors such as angle of impact for aircraft crash, 
etc [2]. If there are no historic records or other scientific grounds to estimate impact of a natural 
phenomena event at the low limit frequency of occurrence (10-7/year), the impact of the event that 
is the most severe reasonably possible (sometimes referred to as probable maximum natural 
phenomena event) may be treated as the bounding event. 
2.3.2.3 Written procedures 
Operations to which nuclear criticality safety is pertinent shall be governed by written procedures. 
All persons participating in these operations shall understand and be familiar with the procedures.

The procedures shall specify all parameters that they are intended to control. They should be such 
that no single, inadvertent departure from a procedure can cause a criticality accident. 
2.3.2.4 Materials control 
The movement of fissionable material shall be controlled. Appropriate material labelling, signs, 
and area posting shall be maintained specifying material identification and all limits on 
parameters subject to procedural control. 
2.3.2.5 Equipment control 
Prior to starting a new or modified process or processing line, it shall be ascertained that all 
equipment is consistent in dimension and material with the assumptions that were made to ensure 
subcriticality [7]. 
2.3.2.6 Quality management program 
A quality management (QM) program that meets the applicable requirements of ANSI/ASME 
NQA-1-2015, Quality Assurance Requirements for Nuclear Facility Applications [11], 
CSA N286-12, Management System Requirements for Nuclear Facilities [12], or equivalent, shall 
be established to implement the activities specified in this document. 
Records shall be maintained according to the QM program to demonstrate that the facility and its 
equipment were constructed according to the design specifications. The licensee shall define a 
formal design change procedure as part of their QM program, so that all modifications made to 
the facility or to the facility’s processes or procedures during all stages of the facility life cycle 
are accurately recorded and their impact assessed with respect to nuclear criticality safety [1]. 
These QM measures are expected to be an integral part of the facility’s overall QM program. 
Throughout this document, “quality assurance” is considered to be one element of the quality 
management system. 
2.3.2.7 Operational control 
Deviations from procedures and unforeseen alterations in process conditions that affect nuclear 
criticality safety shall be reported to management and shall be investigated promptly. When 
available, the information about incidents and events in other installations of the same type shall 
also be investigated and lessons learnt shall be considered. Possible improvements in criticality 
safety practices or equipment shall be considered and action shall be taken to prevent 
recurrence [1, 7]. 
2.3.2.8 Operational reviews 
Operations shall be reviewed frequently (at least annually) to verify that procedures are being 
followed and that process conditions have not been altered in any way that would affect the 
applicable nuclear criticality safety evaluation (NCSE). These reviews shall be conducted in 
consultation with operating personnel, by individuals who are knowledgeable in nuclear 
criticality safety and who, to the extent practicable, are not immediately responsible for the 
operation. 
2.3.2.9 Emergency procedures 
Emergency procedures shall be prepared and approved by management. On-site and off-site 
organizations that are expected to respond to emergencies shall be made aware of conditions that 
September 2020 
REGDOC-2.4.3, Nuclear Criticality Safety, Version 1.1 
 
 
10 
 
might be encountered, and they should be assisted in preparing suitable procedures governing 
their responses. 
2.3.3 
Technical practices 
The effective multiplication factor (keff) of a system depends on the mass, distribution, and 
nuclear properties of the fissionable materials and all other materials with which they are 
associated. 
Nuclear criticality safety is achieved by controlling one or more parameters of the system within 
subcritical limits and by allowances for process contingencies. Prevention of criticality may be 
exercised through: 
1. physical restraints, such as confining a solution to a cylindrical vessel with diameter no 
greater than a specified value, or controlling the spacing between material and 
equipment [7] 
2. use of instrumentation 
During normal operations, a number of parameters shall be measured and controlled to 
prevent a criticality, such as keeping a fissile concentration below a specified value by 
devices that measure concentration and prevent its buildup in a chemical system. The 
measuring devices shall be of high integrity and calibrated against known standards [1]. 
3. chemical means, such as prevention of conditions that allow precipitation 
4. reliance on a natural or credible course of events, such as a process whose nature is to 
keep the density of uranium oxide less than a specified fraction of maximum theoretical 
density 
5. administrative procedures, such as requiring that a mass not exceed an established limit 
6. other means 
Nuclear criticality safety shall be ensured by means of preventive measures that are, as far as 
reasonably achievable, established in the design; that is, by engineered nuclear criticality safety 
controls. 
2.3.3.1 Controlled parameters 
All controlled parameters and their limits shall be specified. The influence of variations in these 
parameters on the keff of the system shall be understood. 
2.3.3.2 Availability and reliability 
The licensee shall ensure that the necessary levels of availability and reliability are maintained for 
nuclear criticality safety controls, as established by the process analysis for normal and credible 
abnormal conditions. 
The following principles shall be incorporated as appropriate to attain the required availability 
and reliability of engineered nuclear criticality safety controls [1]. 
Double contingency principle 
For the prevention of criticality by means of design, the double contingency principle shall be the 
preferred approach. For application of the double contingency principle, the design for a process  
September 2020 
REGDOC-2.4.3, Nuclear Criticality Safety, Version 1.1 
 
 
11 
 
should incorporate sufficient factors of safety to require at least two unlikely, independent and 
concurrent changes in process conditions before a criticality accident is possible. 
Redundancy 
The principle of redundancy should be applied as an important design principle for improving the 
reliability of systems important to safety. Multiple sets of equipment that cannot be tested 
individually should not be considered as redundant. The adopted degree of redundancy shall also 
reflect the potential for undetected failures that could degrade reliability [1]. 
Single-failure criterion 
The design shall ensure that no single failure can result in a loss of capability of engineered 
nuclear criticality safety controls to perform their intended safety function. 
Independence 
The principle of independence (as functional isolation, or as physical separation by distance, 
barriers, or layout of process equipment or components) shall be applied, as appropriate, to 
enhance the reliability of systems, in particular with respect to common cause failures.  
Diversity 
The principle of diversity can enhance reliability and reduce the potential for common cause 
failures. It should be adopted on safety significant systems wherever appropriate and reasonably 
practicable [1]. 
Fail-safe design 
Where practicable, the fail-safe principle should be applied to components important to safety; 
i.e., if a system or component should fail, the facility should pass into a safe state without a 
requirement to initiate any protective or mitigating actions [1]. 
Testability 
All engineered nuclear criticality safety controls shall be designed and arranged so that: 
1. their safety function can be adequately inspected and tested 
2. the engineered nuclear criticality safety controls can be maintained, as appropriate before 
commissioning and at suitable and regular intervals thereafter in accordance with their 
importance to safety 
If it is not practicable to provide adequate testability of a component, the safety analysis should 
take into account the possibility of undetected failures of such equipment [1]. 
2.3.3.3 Geometry control 
Where practicable, reliance should be placed on equipment design in which dimensions are 
limited rather than on administrative controls. Full advantage may be taken of any nuclear 
characteristics of the process materials and equipment. All dimensions and nuclear properties on 
which reliance is placed shall be verified prior to the beginning of operations, and control shall be 
exercised to maintain them. 
September 2020 
REGDOC-2.4.3, Nuclear Criticality Safety, Version 1.1 
 
 
12 
 
Process areas where criticality control vessels contain significant quantities of nuclear materials 
in liquid form should be equipped with alarms to prevent overfilling and with drip trays of 
appropriate capacity and critically safe configuration. 
2.3.3.4 Neutron absorbers 
Reliance may be placed on neutron-absorbing materials, such as cadmium and boron that are 
incorporated in process materials, or in equipment, or in both. Control shall be exercised to 
maintain their continued presence with the intended distributions and concentrations. Where 
practicable, the incorporation of solid neutron absorbers as permanent, integral parts of equipment 
is more desirable than the use of neutron absorbers in solution, because of the processing controls 
required to demonstrate the continued presence of dissolved absorbers. 
Neutron-absorbing materials are most effective for neutrons of thermal energy and care shall be 
exercised to ensure that their effectiveness is not seriously reduced in operational or accident 
conditions, which might change the fissile assembly into one characterized by neutrons of 
intermediate or high energy [7]. 
2.3.3.5 Subcritical limit 
Where applicable data are available, subcritical limits shall be established on bases derived from 
experiments, with adequate allowance for uncertainties in the data. In the absence of directly 
applicable experimental measurements, the limits may be derived from calculations made by a 
method shown by comparison with experimental data to be valid in accordance with 
section 2.3.4. 
2.3.3.6 Neutron reflection 
Where applicable, neutron reflection shall be considered as a parameter for criticality control. The 
most effective neutron reflector commonly encountered in handling and in processing fissionable 
material is water of thickness sufficient to yield maximum nuclear reactivity. However, careful 
consideration shall be given to systems where significant thicknesses of other common structural 
materials (e.g., wood, concrete, steel), which may be more effective neutron reflectors than water, 
may be present. For some situations, the reflection provided by personnel may be important [7] 
(the material content of the human body can provide significant moderating 
capability [appendix F]). 
2.3.3.7 Neutron interaction 
Consideration shall be given to neutron interaction between units when at least two units 
containing fissionable material are present. It is possible to reduce neutron interaction to 
acceptable proportions either by spacing units, by insertion of suitable neutron-moderating and 
absorbing materials between units, or by some combination of these methods [7]. 
2.3.4 
Validation of a calculational method 
Suitable calculational methods for determining the subcritical state of a system shall be selected 
and justified in accordance with an applicable quality assurance standard. The methods vary 
widely in basis and form, and each has its place in the broad spectrum of situations encountered 
in the nuclear criticality safety field. However, the general procedure to be followed in 
establishing validity is common to all. Refer to appendix C for an example of validation of a 
calculational method. 
September 2020 
REGDOC-2.4.3, Nuclear Criticality Safety, Version 1.1 
 
 
13 
 
2.3.4.1 Establishment of bias 
Bias shall be established by correlating the results of critical and exponential experiments with 
results obtained for these same systems by the calculational method being validated. 
When no experimental data are available, establishment of the bias for a calculational method is 
not possible and these requirements cannot be satisfied. Validation of a calculational method by 
comparing the results with those of another calculational method, for example, is unacceptable. 
Commonly, the correlation is expressed in terms of the values of keff calculated for the 
experimental systems at the critical state, in which case the bias is the deviation of the calculated 
values of keff from unity. However, other physical states and parameters may be used; in the 
absence of critical experiments data, the results from techniques that can be demonstrated to 
measure the amount by which a system is subcritical may be used. The bias serves to normalize a 
method over its area (or areas) of applicability so that it will predict critical conditions within the 
limits of the uncertainty in the bias. Generally, neither the bias nor its uncertainty is constant; 
both are expected to be functions of composition and other variables. 
2.3.4.2 Bias trends 
The area (or areas) of applicability of a calculational method may be extended beyond the range 
of experimental conditions over which the bias is established by making use of the trends in the 
bias. Where the extension is large, the method should be supplemented by other calculational 
methods to provide a better estimate of the bias, and especially of its uncertainty in the extended 
area (or areas), and to demonstrate consistency of computed results. 
2.3.4.3 Bias uncertainties 
The uncertainty in the bias shall contain allowances for uncertainties in the experimental 
conditions, for lack of accuracy and precision in the calculational method, and for extension of 
the area (or areas) of applicability. After allowances are made for the accuracy and precision of 
the method and for the bias and uncertainty, a margin in the keff or other correlating parameter 
shall be applied that is sufficiently large to ensure that conditions (calculated by the method to be 
subcritical by this margin) will actually be subcritical. Like the bias and its uncertainty, this 
margin may vary with composition and other variables. 
2.3.4.4 Computer dependence 
If the calculational method involves a computer program, checks shall be performed to confirm 
that the mathematical operations are performed as intended. Any changes in the computer 
program shall be followed by reconfirmation that the mathematical operations are performed as 
intended. 
2.3.4.5 Consistency with measurements 
Nuclear properties, such as cross sections, used in calculational method should be consistent with 
experimental measurements of these properties.

2.3.4.6 Validation report 
A written report of the validation shall be prepared. This report shall: 
1. describe the method with sufficient detail, clarity, and lack of ambiguity to allow 
independent duplication of results 
2. identify the experimental data and list the parameters derived from the data for use in the 
validation of the method 
3. state the area (or areas) of applicability 
4. state the bias and uncertainties over the area (or areas) of applicability 
5. state the margin of subcriticality over the area (or areas) of applicability, including the 
justification for the adequacy of the margin of subcriticality 
6. state the upper subcritical limit (see appendix B for details) 
2.4 
Single-parameter limits for fissile nuclides 
If single-parameter limits for 233U, 235U, and plutonium given in sections 2.4.1, 2.4.2, 2.4.3, and 
2.4.4 are used, an adequate administrative margin of subcriticality shall be applied to ensure 
compliance with section 2.3.2.2. 
These limits were calculated by methods satisfying the requirements of section 2.3.4. A limit 
shall be applied only when the surrounding materials, including other nearby fissionable 
materials, can be shown to increase the effective multiplication factor (keff) no more than it would 
be increased if the unit were enclosed by a contiguous layer of water of unlimited thickness. A 
limit may be applied to a mixture of fissile nuclides by considering all components of the mixture 
to be the one with the most restrictive limit. 
Process specifications shall incorporate margins to protect against uncertainties in process 
variables and against a limit being accidentally exceeded. 
2.4.1 
Uniform aqueous solutions 
Any one of the limits of Table 2-1 is applicable provided a uniform aqueous solution is 
maintained. It is therefore implied that the concentrations of the saturated solutions are not 
exceeded. 
The 239Pu limits apply to mixtures of plutonium isotopes, provided that the concentration of 240Pu 
exceeds that of 241Pu and provided that 241Pu is considered to be 239Pu in computing mass or 
concentration. Less restrictive limits are provided in section 2.5.3 for plutonium isotopic 
compositions containing appreciable concentrations of 240Pu. 
The limit on atomic ratio is equivalent to the limit on solution concentration, but the ratio limit 
may also be applied to non-aqueous solutions, regardless of the chemical form of the fissile 
nuclide.

Metallic units 
The enrichment limit for uranium and the mass limits given in Table 2-3 apply to a single piece

The 233U and 235U limits apply to mixtures of either isotope with 234U, 236U, or 238U provided that 
234U is considered to be 233U or 235U, respectively, in computing mass [14]. The 239Pu limits apply 
to isotopic mixtures of plutonium, provided that the concentration of 240Pu exceeds that of 241Pu 
and all isotopes are considered to be 239Pu in computing mass [15]. Density limits may be 
adjusted for isotopic composition.

2.4.4 
Oxides 
The limits in Tables 2-4 and 2-5 apply only if the oxide contains no more than 1.5% water by 
weight. The mass limits apply to a single piece having no concave surfaces. They may be 
extended to an assembly of pieces, provided that there is no additional interspersed moderation. 
The mass limit is given equivalently as mass of nuclide and as mass of oxide (including 
moisture). It is emphasized that the limits in Tables 2-4 and 2-5 are valid only under the specified 
bulk density restrictions. Note that, particularly for UO3, material densities in excess of the full 
densities of Table 2-4 may be possible and hence that the limits of Table 2-4 may not be valid for 
highly compacted oxides. With water content limited to 1.5%, the enrichment limit of Table 2-2 
for uranium oxides is increased to 3.2% 235U. 
2.5 
Multiparameter control 
Although the single-parameter limits are adequate for many purposes, they are inconveniently 
and uneconomically small for many others. Simultaneous limitation of two or more parameters 
results in a less restrictive limit for the one of interest. 
If multi-parameter limits for 233U, 235U, and plutonium given in sections 2.5.1, 2.5.2, 2.5.3, and 
2.5.4 are used, an adequate administrative margin of subcriticality shall be applied to ensure 
compliance with section 2.3.2.2. 
A few particularly useful examples are given in Subsections 2.5.1 through 2.5.4. All were 
calculated by methods satisfying section 2.3.4. These limits shall be applied only when the 
surrounding materials can be shown to increase the effective multiplication factor (keff) no more 
than it would be increased if the unit were enclosed by a contiguous layer of water of unlimited 
thickness. General information for multiparameter control may be found in the technical 
literature [16, 17, 18, 19]. 
Note that process specifications shall incorporate margins to protect against uncertainties in 
process variables and against a limit being accidentally exceeded. 
2.5.1 
Uranium metal- and uranium oxide- water mixtures at low 235U enrichment 
An application of multiparameter control is control of both the 235U enrichment of uranium and 
one of the parameters of section 2.4. Parameter limits [20] applicable to aqueous systems 
containing uranium metal or uranium oxide (UO2), regardless of the size and shape of metal or 
oxide pieces, are specified as functions of enrichment in tables VI-VIII of [20] which give, 
respectively, the mass of 235U, the cylinder diameter, the slab thickness, the volume, and the areal 
density. 
2.5.2 
Aqueous uranium solutions at low 235U enrichment 
A similar application of multiparameter control is control of both 235U enrichment and one of the 
parameters of Table 2-1, together with the maintenance of a uniform aqueous solution. Table 2-6 
lists parameter limits for uniform aqueous solutions of uranium where the enrichment is 
controlled within the stated limit. Concentrations of saturated solutions, which are here taken to 
be 5 molar for UO2F2 solutions and 2.5 molar for UO2(NO3)2 solutions, shall not be exceeded.

Uniform aqueous solutions of Pu(NO3)4 containing 240Pu 
Reliance on, and hence control of, the isotopic concentration of 240Pu in plutonium permits 
greater limits for Pu(NO3)4 solutions than are listed in Table 2-1. Where plutonium, in addition, is 
intimately mixed with natural uranium, limits are even greater. Limits for this case are included in 
section 8, Nuclear Criticality Control and Safety of Plutonium-Uranium Fuel Mixtures Outside 
Reactors. However, the amount of the increase is dependent on 241Pu concentration.

Criticality Accident Alarm System 
Some parts of this section are extracted from ANSI/ANS-8.3-1997 (Reaffirmed in 2017), 
Criticality Accident Alarm System, with permission of the publisher, the American Nuclear 
Society. The text may have been adapted to make it applicable to Canada’s international 
obligations to IAEA and consistent with CNSC’s regulatory requirements. 
3.1 
Introduction 
Guidance for the prevention of criticality accidents in the handling, storing, processing, and 
transporting of fissionable materials is presented in section 2 of this document. In most operations 
with fissionable materials the risk of inadvertent criticality is very low; however, this risk cannot 
be eliminated. Where a criticality accident may lead to an excessive radiation dose, it is important 
to provide a means of alerting personnel and a procedure for their prompt evacuation, or other 
protective actions to limit their exposure to radiation. 
3.2 
Scope 
Section 3 (this section) applies to all operations involving fissionable materials in which 
inadvertent criticality can occur and cause personnel to receive an excessive radiation dose. 
This section does not apply to detection of criticality events where no excessive radiation dose to 
personnel is credible, nor to nuclear reactors or critical experiments. This document does not 
include details of administrative actions or of emergency response actions that occur after alarm 
activation. 
3.3 
General principles 
3.3.1 
General 
The purpose of an alarm system is to reduce risk to personnel. Evaluation of the overall risk 
should recognize that hazards may result from false alarms and subsequent sudden interruption of 
operations and relocation of personnel. 
Subject to the evaluation of the overall risk described above, a criticality alarm system meeting 
the requirements of this regulatory document shall be installed in areas where: 
1. inadvertent criticality can occur, and 
2. excessive radiation dose to personnel is credible should the inadvertent criticality occur 
Where alarm systems are installed, emergency procedures shall be maintained. Guidance for the 
preparation of emergency plans is provided in section 16, Nuclear Criticality Accident 
Emergency Planning and Response. 
Process equipment used in areas from which immediate evacuation is required should be so 
designed that leaving the equipment does not introduce significant risk. 
September 2020 
REGDOC-2.4.3, Nuclear Criticality Safety, Version 1.1 
 
 
22 
 
3.3.2 
Coverage 
3.3.2.1 Evaluation of criticality alarm systems 
In view of the requirement of List Item 1 in section 3.3.1, the need for criticality alarm systems 
shall be evaluated: 
1. for all activities involving 233U, 235U, and 239Pu, in which the inventory of fissionable 
materials (containing any of these three isotopes) exceeds 500 g of 233U, 700 g of 235U, 
450 g of 239Pu, or 450 g of any combination of these three isotopes 
2. for all activities involving fissionable materials in which neutron moderators or reflectors 
more effective than light water are present, or unique material configurations exist such 
that critical mass requirements may be less than the subcritical mass limits listed above, 
or 
3. for all activities in which inventory of fissionable materials exceeds 80% of the 
appropriate critical mass if subcritical mass limits listed above are not applicable, or not 
appropriate 
This evaluation shall be performed for all activities in which the inventory of fissionable 
materials in individual unrelated areas exceeds the subcritical mass limits noted above. 
For this evaluation, individual areas may be considered unrelated when the boundaries between 
the areas are such that there can be no transfer of materials between areas [8], the minimum 
separation between material in adjacent areas is 10 cm, and the areal density of fissile material 
averaged over each individual area is less than 50 g/m2. This stipulation applies only to 233U, 235U, 
and 239Pu. 
3.3.2.2 Installation of criticality alarm systems 
A criticality alarm system meeting the requirements of this section shall be installed in areas 
where personnel would be subject to an excessive radiation dose. For this purpose, the maximum 
fission yield integrated over the duration of the accident may be assumed not to exceed 2.0 x 1019 
fissions. The basis for a different maximum fission yield shall be documented. 
If criticality accidents of lesser magnitude than the minimum accident of concern given in 
section 3.4.6 are of concern, then other detection methods (e.g., audible personnel dosimetry) 
should be considered. These other detection methods are not considered to be criticality alarm 
systems and are not covered by section 3 of this document. 
3.3.2.3 Detection of criticality accidents 
In areas in which criticality alarm coverage is required, a means shall be provided to detect a 
criticality accident and to signal that prompt protective action is required. 
3.3.3 
Criticality alarm 
Criticality alarm signals shall be for prompt evacuation or other protective actions. The criticality 
alarm signals should be uniform throughout the system. The signals shall be distinctive from 
other signals or alarms that require a response different from the response necessary in the event 
of a criticality accident. 
The signal generators shall be automatically and promptly actuated upon detection of a criticality 
accident. 
September 2020 
REGDOC-2.4.3, Nuclear Criticality Safety, Version 1.1 
 
 
23 
 
After actuation, the signal generators shall continue to function as required by emergency 
procedures, even if the radiation falls below the alarm point, and at least long enough to allow 
people to reach their evacuation assembly points and perform the procedures to account for all 
personnel. Manual resets, with limited access, should be provided outside areas that require 
evacuation [8]. 
A means for manual actuation of the criticality alarm signal may be provided. 
For all occupied areas where personnel protective action is required in the event of criticality 
accident detection, the number and placement of criticality alarm signal generators shall be such 
that the signals are adequate to notify personnel promptly throughout those areas. 
The audio generators should produce an overall sound pressure level of at least 75 dB, but not 
less than 10 dB above the maximum ambient noise level typical of each area for which audio 
coverage is to be provided. 
Because excessive noise levels can be injurious to personnel, the audio generators should not 
produce an A-weighted sound level in excess of 115 dB at the ear of an individual. 
In areas with very high audio background or mandatory hearing protection, visual signals or other 
alarm means should be considered. 
3.3.4 
Dependability 
Consideration shall be given to the avoidance of false alarms. This may be accomplished by 
providing reliable single detector channels or by requiring concurrent response of two or more 
detectors to initiate the alarm. 
In redundant systems, failure of any single channel shall not prevent compliance with the 
detection criterion specified in section 3.4.6. 
A means that will not cause an evacuation should be provided to test the response and 
performance of the alarm system [8]. 
Portable instruments may be used in special situations to augment an installed criticality accident 
alarm system. Examples of such situations include alarm system maintenance or testing, 
evacuation drills, activities in areas not normally occupied by personnel, or other special 
operations. 
Where portable instruments are used to meet the intent of section 3 of this document, the usage 
shall be evaluated to determine appropriate criteria are met. Criteria for such use of portable 
instruments shall be specified in procedures. 
Process areas in which activities will continue during power outages shall have emergency power 
supplies for alarm systems, or such activities shall be monitored continuously with portable 
instruments. 
Adequate sensitivity of the alarm system to respond to the minimum accident of concern is 
addressed in section 3.4.7. 
September 2020 
REGDOC-2.4.3, Nuclear Criticality Safety, Version 1.1 
 
 
24 
 
Detectors shall not fail to trigger an alarm when subjected to intense radiation exceeding 
1000 Gy/h. Compliance with this provision may be demonstrated by a test of sample detectors or 
by a manufacturer’s test of production samples [8]. 
3.4 
Criteria for system design 
3.4.1 
Reliability 
The system shall be designed for high reliability and should use components that do not require 
frequent servicing (such as lubrication or cleaning). 
The system should be designed to minimize the effects of non-use, deterioration, power surges, 
and other adverse conditions. The design of the system should be as simple as is consistent with 
the objectives of ensuring reliable actuation of the criticality alarm signal and avoidance of false 
alarms. 
3.4.2 
System vulnerability 
All components of the system should be located or protected to minimize damage in case of fire, 
explosion, corrosive atmosphere, or other extreme conditions. The system should be designed to 
minimize the potential for failure (including false alarm) due to human error. Major system 
components should be labelled. 
3.4.3 
Seismic tolerance 
The system should remain operational in the event of seismic shock equivalent to the site-specific 
design basis earthquake, or to the equivalent value specified by the National Building Code of 
Canada that applies to the structure. 
3.4.4 
Failure warning 
The system should be designed to provide a visible or audible warning signal at some normally 
occupied location to indicate system malfunction or the loss of primary power. 
3.4.5 
Response time 
The system shall be designed to produce the criticality alarm signal within one half-second (0.5 s) 
of detector recognition of a criticality accident. 
3.4.6 
Detection criterion 
A basic consideration in the design of a criticality accident alarm system is the definition of the 
lower magnitude of the event size to be detected, termed the “minimum accident of concern”. 
Criticality alarm systems shall be designed to respond immediately to the minimum accident of 
concern. In situations where there is only nominal shielding, the definition of minimum accident 
of concern provided in the glossary should be used. The basis for a different definition of 
minimum accident of concern shall be documented. 
Document LA-13638 [21] describes nuclear criticality accidents that occurred during processing 
or handling of fissionable material. Consideration of these events resulted in the definition of the 
minimum accident of concern provided in the glossary. 
September 2020 
REGDOC-2.4.3, Nuclear Criticality Safety, Version 1.1 
 
 
25 
 
3.4.7 
Sensitivity 
Criticality alarm systems shall be designed so that alarm actuation shall occur as a result of the 
minimum duration of the transient. It may be assumed that the minimum duration of the radiation 
transient is one millisecond (1 ms). 
The alarm trip point shall be set low enough to detect the minimum accident of concern. The 
alarm trip point should be set high enough to minimize the probability of an alarm from sources 
other than criticality. 
3.4.8 
Placement of detectors 
The spacing of detectors shall be consistent with the selected alarm trip point and with the 
detection criterion. 
The location and spacing of detectors should be chosen to minimize the effect of shielding by 
massive equipment or materials. Shielding from low-density materials of construction, such as 
wood framing, thin interior walls, hollow brick tiles, etc., may be disregarded. 
Appendix D provides examples of gamma and neutron detector placement. 
3.4.9 
Interlocking with ventilation system 
Interlocking with the ventilation system should be provided for shutting off ventilation to prevent 
release of fission gases outside of the affected area. Consideration should be given that shutting 
off ventilation does not generate other safety hazards. 
3.5 
Testing 
3.5.1 
Initial tests 
Initial tests, inspections, and checks of the system shall verify that the fabrication and installation 
were made in accordance with design plans and specifications. 
3.5.2 
Special tests 
Following modifications or repairs, or events that call the system performance into question, there 
shall be tests and inspections adequate to demonstrate system operability. 
3.5.3 
Response to radiation 
System response to radiation shall be measured periodically to confirm continuing instrument 
performance. The test interval should be determined on the basis of experience. In the absence of 
experience, tests should be performed at least monthly. 
Records of tests shall be maintained. System designs may incorporate self-checking features to 
automate portions of this testing. 
3.5.4 
Periodic tests 
The entire alarm system shall be tested periodically. Each signal generator should be tested at 
least annually. Field observations shall establish that criticality alarm signals are functional 
throughout all areas where personnel could be subject to an excessive radiation dose. All 
personnel in affected areas shall be notified before testing of the criticality alarm signals. 
September 2020 
REGDOC-2.4.3, Nuclear Criticality Safety, Version 1.1 
 
 
26 
 
3.5.5 
Corrective action 
When tests reveal inadequate performance, corrective action shall be taken without unnecessary 
delay. If portable instrument use is required, the criteria of section 3.3.4 shall be met. 
3.5.6 
Test procedures 
Procedures for system testing shall minimize both false alarms and inadvertent initiation of 
emergency response. The procedures shall require that the systems be returned to normal 
operation immediately following tests. 
The IEC 60860 Standard, Radiation Protection Instrumentation - Warning Equipment for 
Criticality Accidents [10], holds useful information regarding electrical characteristics and testing 
procedures for alarm equipment. This document may be used as a guide in these areas. 
3.5.7 
Records 
Records of tests and corrective actions for each system shall be maintained. These records 
provide information on system operability and help identify sources of failure. 
3.5.8 
Out of service 
The licensee shall develop and implement out-of-service criteria for the nuclear criticality alarm 
system. 
If the system is removed from service due to an unforeseen problem, the licensee shall 
immediately inform CNSC as to the cause of the removal and its expected duration. 
If an adequate back-up alarm system, as described in section 3.3.4, is in use during this 
unforeseen situation and the system will be returned to service within the timeframe specified in 
the out of service criteria, it may be acceptable to continue processes within the facility. 
3.6 
Employee familiarization 
3.6.1 
Posted instructions 
Instructions regarding response to criticality alarm signals shall be posted at strategic locations 
within areas requiring alarm coverage. 
3.6.2 
Training and criticality alarm drills 
Guidance for training of employees and visitors, and for conduct of criticality alarm drills, is 
provided in section 12, Administrative Practices for Nuclear Criticality Safety.

Use of Borosilicate-Glass Raschig Rings as a Neutron Absorber in Solutions of 
Fissile Material 
Some parts of this section are extracted from ANSI/ANS-8.5-1996 (Reaffirmed in 2017), Use of 
Borosilicate-Glass Raschig Rings as a Neutron Absorber in Solutions of Fissile Material, with 
permission of the publisher, the American Nuclear Society. The text may have been adapted to 
make it applicable to Canada’s international obligations to IAEA and consistent with CNSC’s 
regulatory requirements. 
4.1 
Introduction 
Raschig rings are used inside vessels and tanks containing solutions of fissile material to act as 
neutron absorbers and prevent a potential criticality accident. 
4.2 
Scope 
Section 4 (this section) provides guidance for the use of borosilicate-glass Raschig rings as a 
neutron absorber for criticality control in ring-packed vessels containing solutions of 235U, 239Pu, 
or 233U. The chemical and physical environment, properties of the rings and packed vessels, 
maintenance inspection procedures, and operating guidelines are specified. 
4.3 
General requirements 
The purpose of Raschig rings in criticality safety applications is to assure subcriticality for normal 
and credible abnormal conditions over the operating life of a vessel. General requirements for use 
of Raschig rings for criticality control are: 
1. the nuclear criticality safety criteria of section 2, Nuclear Criticality Safety in Operations 
with Fissionable Materials Outside Reactors, shall be applied 
2. the physical and chemical properties of Raschig rings specified in this document shall be 
verified before their initial use as a criticality control 
3. subsequent to initial use, periodic verification shall assure that the required physical and 
chemical properties of the Raschig rings are maintained 
4. the extent and frequency of the verification of the physical and chemical properties may 
be determined from a documented history of trends in these properties of the Raschig 
rings in the particular environment in which they are used; otherwise, the frequencies 
specified in section 4.7.4 shall apply at all times 
5. methods for measuring the Raschig ring properties shall be documented and reviewed by 
qualified personnel for applicability and technical validity 
6. Raschig rings shall be compatible with the chemical environment and physical conditions 
of the solutions in which they are immersed 
7. use of Raschig rings in criticality safety applications other than those addressed by this 
document should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis 
September 2020 
REGDOC-2.4.3, Nuclear Criticality Safety, Version 1.1 
 
 
28 
 
4.3.1 
Physical environment 
4.3.1.1 Mechanical environment 
Raschig rings shall not be used in applications where credible agitation or movement of the rings 
can damage the rings sufficiently to compromise their effectiveness as a criticality control. 
Applications where the potential for such damage exists include but are not limited to 
evaporators, portable vessels, pulsed columns, and vessels equipped for sparging [22]. 
4.3.1.2 Radiation environment 
Raschig rings shall not be used in fields of intense ionizing radiation. Maximum time-averaged 
radiation dose rates for rings shall be limited to the following [22]: 
1. gamma radiation: 106 Gy/y 
2. beta radiation (energy ≤ 0.05 MeV): 107 Gy/y 
3. beta radiation (energy > 0.05 MeV): 106 Gy/y 
4. neutron radiation: 500 Gy/y 
5. alpha radiation: absorbed dose rate in glass equivalent to that received from a uniform 
solution source generating 2 watts per litre of solution total alpha particle power 
4.3.2 
Chemical environment 
4.3.2.1 Near-neutral environment 
Light water and other near-neutral solutions that do not exceed the free fluoride and phosphate 
ion concentrations specified in section 4.3.2.2, items 3 and 4, are acceptable chemical 
environments for Raschig rings, even though such solutions may have a pH slightly greater 
than 7.0. 
4.3.2.2 Acidic environment 
The solution in contact with the glass rings shall be limited to: 
1. pH less than or equal to 7.0, except as noted in section 4.3.2.1 above 
2. temperature no greater than 120°C 
3. free fluoride concentration no greater than 0.0001 molar, unless compatibility with such a 
concentration is established according to sections 4.4.4 and 4.7.4 of this document 
4. phosphate ion concentration no greater than 1 molar 
Subject to these restrictions, acceptable chemical environments include solutions of salts of 
organic or inorganic acids, hydrocarbons, and solutions of complexing or chelating agents in 
hydrocarbons. Results of corrosion tests on borosilicate-glass Raschig rings that support these 
requirements appear in the literature [22, 23]. 
4.3.2.3 Basic environment 
Raschig rings shall not be used as a criticality control in basic solutions unless chemical and 
physical limits for the application have been determined and documented. If rings are so used, 
inspection frequencies should be derived from a trending analysis to assure the requirements of 
this regulatory document are met. Studies of the corrosion of borosilicate-glass in basic 
environments appear in the literature [23].

29 
 
4.4 
Ring specifications 
4.4.1 
Composition 
4.4.1.1 Type of glass 
The normal composition of glass used for Raschig rings shall be Type I, Class A glass as 
specified in Standard Specification for Glasses in Laboratory Apparatus, 
ASTM E 438-1992 [24]. 
4.4.1.2 Density of glass 
The density of glass used for Raschig rings shall not be less than 2.22 mg/mm3 at 25°C. 
4.4.1.3 10B content of glass 
The 10B isotope content of glass used for Raschig rings shall be no less than 0.655 wt% of the 
total glass weight. This isotopic content may be determined directly or inferred from: 
1. a measurement of elemental boron and the 10B/11B ratio, or 
2. a measurement of the boron oxide content, the 10B/11B ratio, and a determination of the 
boron/ oxygen ratio of the oxide 
4.4.2 
Ring diameter 
Each Raschig ring shall have an average outside diameter no greater than 38 mm (1.5 in), except 
at the ends, where a slightly larger diameter, such as might be produced by fire polishing, is 
acceptable [22]. 
4.4.3 
Surface finish 
All surfaces of the finished Raschig rings shall be smooth and free of sharp edges. 
4.4.4 
Chemical 
Chemical tests to which the Raschig rings will be exposed, and the tests’ acceptance criteria, shall 
be established, documented, and reviewed by qualified personnel. These tests shall be performed 
on the rings to demonstrate their compatibility under normal and credible abnormal conditions of 
service (e.g., exposure to nitric acid, sodium hydroxide, and hydrogen fluoride). 
4.4.5 
Mechanical 
Raschig rings shall be subjected to mechanical tests designed to evaluate glass integrity. These 
tests shall demonstrate that the rings will remain intact while in service under anticipated normal 
and credible abnormal conditions. If use is generally static, such that liquid flows easily into and 
out of a vessel with no dynamic motion between rings, mechanical tests need merely confirm that 
the glass can withstand the static loading. If use involves vigorous mixing actions that might 
cause breakage through movement, mechanical tests must confirm that the rings can also 
withstand dynamic forces without breaking. 
4.5 
Specifications for packed vessels 
Vessels to contain Raschig rings shall be designed and fabricated to facilitate: 
1. the addition and removal of solution 
2. the addition and removal of Raschig rings 
September 2020 
REGDOC-2.4.3, Nuclear Criticality Safety, Version 1.1 
 
 
30 
 
3. the removal and replacement of representative samples of both solution and rings for 
testing purposes 
4. the measurement of the volume of solution 
5. the verification of the level of the rings packed in the vessel 
6. the cleaning of the vessel and the rings 
Pipes intended for the removal of solution shall be designed and installed to prevent removal of 
pieces of glass along with the solution (e.g., a screen over the removal pipe). 
4.5.1 
Installation of rings 
All regions of the vessel shall be filled with well-settled rings (that is, rings that have been gently 
manipulated during loading such that they are not likely to settle further during use). 
Carefully hand-placed rings may have a greater glass volume fraction than even randomly 
oriented rings; both are allowed. An installation and compaction procedure that minimizes 
breakage, aids settling, and minimizes voids should be used. 
The initial loading of rings into a vessel may use unmarked rings that satisfy the requirements of 
this regulatory document. However, if rings are added to the initial loading (to compensate for 
settling or to replace rings removed for some analysis), the added rings shall be permanently 
identified to preclude their subsequent use as rings characteristic of that initial loading. 
4.5.2 
Unpacked piping in vessels 
The ring-packed vessel may contain regions free of Raschig rings (in apparent contradiction to 
section 4.5.1) provided each ring-free region has an outside diameter less than 64 mm (2.5 in). 
These might be formed by pipes embedded in an otherwise well-settled packing of rings. The 
edge-to-edge spacing between each ring-free region shall be at least 305 mm (12 in). The ring-
free region may be produced by a single pipe or a cluster of pipes, provided the cluster of pipes 
also has an outside diameter less than 64 mm (2.5 in). These regions may serve any purpose (e.g., 
a perforated pipe to contain a set of control Raschig rings) [22]. 
4.5.3 
Determination of ring level 
The top surface of the Raschig rings within a vessel shall be inspected periodically to detect 
settling through time and use. This inspection may be visual or non-visual (e.g., radiography). If a 
visual method is to be used to inspect the level of the rings, sufficient ports or sight glasses should 
be provided to allow inspection of the entire upper surface. See section 4.7.1 for restoration of 
ring volume if settling is detected. 
4.5.4 
Determination of glass volume fraction 
The glass volume fraction shall be determined each time new rings are installed in the vessel. 
This shall apply to either a full replacement or a partial addition of rings to compensate for 
settling.

REGDOC-2.4.3, Nuclear Criticality Safety, Version 1.1 
 
 
31 
 
4.5.5 
Allowable volume of solution in a vessel packed with rings 
The level of the solution shall not exceed the level of uniformly packed rings. There shall be a 
method of determining that this condition is met even if the rings should settle through time or 
use, to preclude the possibility of solution accumulation in a ring-free region. This protection may 
be afforded by: 
1. inspections made with a frequency shown to be adequate to identify unacceptable settling 
between inspections (see section 4.7.1) 
2. an overflow pipe that limits the liquid level in the vessel, or 
3. operating procedures that limit the liquid level in the vessel provided the vessel is 
equipped with a liquid-level indicating device augmented by an appropriate alarm system 
4.6 
Maximum specified concentrations of fissile solutions 
Raschig rings pack differently in different vessels, leading to small variations in the resulting 
glass volume fraction in the vessel. Table 4-1 gives the maximum permissible fissile isotope 
concentration for uranium and plutonium solutions in vessels of unlimited size packed with 
borosilicate-glass Raschig rings that meet the requirements of this regulatory document [22, 25]. 
Note: Table 4-1 shall not be used with mixtures of uranium and plutonium in solution. Low-level 
contamination of one element with the other is allowed. The definition of low-level 
contamination shall be justified and documented. The solutions referred to in the table shall have 
a hydrogen density not less than 75 g H per litre and not greater than 115 g H per litre. 
The three columns under the heading “Uranium” are intended to refer to solutions generally

2. the center column pertains to nominal 235U solutions with low levels of 233U 
contamination

Whenever any combination of isotopes falls into more than one category, the concentration limit 
of either column may be applied. In all cases, low levels of plutonium contamination are allowed.

Maintenance inspection 
Raschig rings shall be inspected periodically to determine whether they have settled, whether 
there have been changes in their physical or chemical properties, and whether solids have 
accumulated. A record of the results of inspections of installed rings shall be maintained for each 
packed vessel. These data shall be used to determine the frequency of inspection through 
documented analysis. Any change in inspection frequency, and its justification, shall be 
documented. 
4.7.1 
Settling 
If settling is detected, rings meeting specifications of this document shall be added to restore full 
packing. Those rings shall be permanently identified to preclude subsequent use as samples for 
maintenance because they are not characteristic of the initial loading. The number of rings added 
and other appropriate comments shall be recorded and maintained for the life of the set of rings 
packed into the vessel. Settling trends may be determined by comparison with past results. 
4.7.2 
Fissile solids 
A record shall be maintained to enable evaluation of, and to set appropriate controls over, the 
accumulation of fissile solids on the Raschig rings and on the inner surface of the vessel. The 
rings in the vessel shall be cleaned or replaced and the vessel walls cleaned if the deposited solids 
contain more than 50 g of 233U, 235U, Pu, or any combination of these isotopes per litre of 
glass [22]. 
4.7.3 
Physical properties 
In-service Raschig rings shall be periodically retested, to determine their current physical 
properties, by testing of ring samples from representative regions of each vessel. The purpose is 
to assure that the requirements of this section continue to be met. 
Procedures shall be implemented to prevent the inclusion in the sample of Raschig rings that were 
not part of the initial loading in the vessel (see section 4.7.1). 
Control Raschig rings may be used for these tests provided the control Raschig rings remain in 
the vessel except for test periods not exceeding two weeks per test and a total of four weeks per 
year. The vessel may be in continued use while control Raschig rings are removed from it, 
provided the specifications of sections 4.5.2 and 4.5.3 continue to be met. 
If any of the tested in-service Raschig rings fail to meet any of the ring specifications given in 
section 4.4 during their maintenance inspection, then an evaluation shall be performed to 
determine appropriate action. These appropriate actions may be (but are not limited to) one or 
more of the following actions: 
1. reanalyze the failed parameter(s) on the same set of rings 
2. obtain a new sample of rings and reanalyze the failed parameter(s) on this new set of 
samples, or 
3. replace the entire packing of rings in the vessel 
Trending analysis of periodic physical and chemical tests may be used to predict the useful 
lifetime of Raschig rings. 
September 2020 
REGDOC-2.4.3, Nuclear Criticality Safety, Version 1.1 
 
 
34 
 
4.7.4 
Inspection intervals 
Raschig rings shall be inspected periodically to demonstrate their continued criticality control 
properties. These required tests shall include ring settling (see section 4.7.1), solids accumulation 
(see section 4.7.2), and physical properties of the glass (see section 4.7.3). The initial interval for 
inspection of rings shall not exceed: 
1. 13 months for rings not subjected to agitation, or 
2. 7 months for rings subjected to agitation 
This initial inspection interval may be set at longer times when justified by a documented and 
approved analysis. 
Subsequent intervals between inspections may be based on the analysis of the trends in the data. 
If records and inspections confirm that no solution has been present in a vessel since the 
preceding inspection and if the vessel has not been subject to corrosive fumes, then only the 
settling test (see section 4.7.1) shall be required. 
If Raschig rings are exposed to solutions in which the free fluoride concentration is greater than 
0.0001 molar, an appropriate frequency of inspection shall be established to ensure the rings 
retain the chemical and mechanical properties specified in section 4.4.

Safety in Conducting Subcritical Neutron Multiplication Measurements In Situ 
Some parts of this section are extracted from ANSI/ANS-8.6-1983 (Reaffirmed in 2017), Safety 
in Conducting Subcritical Neutron Multiplication Measurements In Situ, with permission of the 
publisher, the American Nuclear Society. The text may have been adapted to make it applicable 
to Canada’s international obligations to IAEA and consistent with CNSC’s regulatory 
requirements. 
5.1 
Introduction 
Safe and economical operations with fissile materials require knowledge of the subcriticality of 
configurations that arise in material processing, storage, and transportation. Data from critical 
experiments have been a principal source of information with which to establish safe practices; 
however, the need has developed for measurements of limited application that can more 
expeditiously provide guidance for safe operations with fissile materials in the specific 
arrangements encountered in industrial environments. Such measurements are made in some plant 
process areas and are referred to as in situ nuclear measurements. 
Personnel protection during in situ experiments depends on the avoidance of a criticality accident. 
Section 5 (this section) contains safety criteria and practices for conducting such experiments. 
This section is oriented toward measurements of neutron multiplication and thus reflects the 
preponderance of this experience, but the principles presented in this section may be applied to 
measurements based on other reactivity indexes, such as the prompt-neutron decay constant. 
5.2 
Scope 
This section provides safety guidance for conducting subcritical neutron-multiplication 
measurements where the only barrier is the administrative procedures and therefore physical 
protection of personnel against the consequences of a criticality accident is not provided. The 
objectives of in situ measurements are either to confirm an adequate safety margin or to improve 
an estimate of such a margin. The first objective may constitute a test of the criticality safety of a 
design that is based on calculations. The second may affect improved operating conditions by 
reducing the uncertainty of safety margins and providing guidance to new designs. 
5.3 
Administrative practices 
A written procedure for each new in situ experiment shall be prepared and reviewed in a manner 
approved by management. Primary responsibility for safety shall be assigned to one individual 
experienced in the performance of subcritical or critical experiments. Another experienced 
experimenter shall review the procedure. 
The written procedure shall be reviewed by all who are expected to take part in the experiment. 
At least two persons shall be present during an experiment. 
A record of the status and progress of the experiment shall be maintained with particular 
emphasis on safety. 
Emergency procedures and radiation detection instrumentation appropriate to the experiment 
shall be provided.

5.4 
Equipment criteria 
The mechanical integrity of equipment to be used in conjunction with the fissile assembly shall 
be verified prior to the experiment. 
The proper functioning of all counting circuits, neutron- and gamma-ray-sensing devices, alarms, 
and other necessary instrumentation shall be verified prior to the experiment. 
A source of neutrons shall be present to produce a meaningful indication of neutron 
multiplication. This source may be inherent in the fissile assembly, i.e., neutrons from 
spontaneous fission or from (α, n) reactions. 
At least two independent neutron-sensitive counting devices shall monitor the neutron population 
in the fissile assembly under investigation. 
A signal continuously indicative of the neutron level shall be audible and may be supplemented 
by an otherwise apparent signal such as a flashing light. 
5.5 
Operational practices 
If anyone participating in the experiment expresses doubt of the safety of a particular action or 
step, the experiment shall be suspended until the doubt is resolved. 
The cause of any unexpected behaviour of the assembly and its associated equipment or of any 
peculiarity in the resulting data shall be resolved before further reactivity additions. 
A reactivity limit for the fissile assembly shall be defined in the written procedure. This limit may 
be stated in terms of a maximum value of neutron multiplication or of a fraction of an estimated 
critical mass, volume, or dimension. The margin below criticality shall be commensurate with 
experimental uncertainties; allowance shall be made for effects of neutron reflection brought 
about by personnel or other movable objects. 
Plots of reciprocal neutron multiplication as a function of the parameter identifying reactivity 
change shall be maintained independently by at least two persons using data from two or more 
neutron-detector channels. These plots shall have a sufficient number of points to permit 
meaningful extrapolation. 
The magnitude of reactivity additions shall be guided by extrapolation of the plots of reciprocal 
neutron multiplication and shall be such that the reactivity limit defined in section 5.5 is not 
exceeded. Caution is recommended in the interpretation of reciprocal neutron multiplication 
curves; typical experimental curves are discussed in The Technology of Nuclear Reactor Safety, 
Vol. 1, Chapter 5 [26]. 
Every addition of reactivity shall be authorized by the person assigned primary responsibility for 
safety in accordance with section 5.3. 
No reactivity addition shall be made until the effects of preceding additions have been evaluated 
and until the response to be expected from the subsequent addition has been estimated. 
Reactivity additions shall not be made simultaneously by more than one method. 
September 2020 
REGDOC-2.4.3, Nuclear Criticality Safety, Version 1.1 
 
 
37 
 
Alteration in the method of reactivity addition shall not be such as to invalidate the extrapolation 
of the plot of reciprocal multiplication. 
Consideration shall be given to the possibility of inadvertent reactivity additions such as might 
occur from the instability of slurries, from collapse or formation of voids, from inadvertent 
transfer of material, or from other conditions. 
Place of source and detectors shall be such that the neutrons observed are predominantly those 
produced by the fissile assembly. 
If a neutron source or detector is to be moved from one location to another, or if attenuating 
material is to be inserted between the source and detectors, the effect on neutron counting rate of 
such change shall be measured before further reactivity addition. 
Changing the spacing between elements of an array should not be the means of changing 
reactivity. Data from reciprocal multiplication plots obtained from separate experiments with 
different spacings may be used to evaluate the effect of element spacing on neutron 
multiplication.

Nuclear Criticality Safety in the Storage of Fissile Materials 
Some parts of this section are extracted from ANSI/ANS-8.7-1998 (reaffirmed in 2017), Nuclear 
Criticality Safety in the Storage of Fissile Materials, with permission of the publisher, the 
American Nuclear Society. The text may have been adapted to make it applicable to Canada’s 
international obligations to IAEA and consistent with CNSC’s regulatory requirements. 
6.1 
Introduction 
Section 6 (this section) provides general storage criteria based on validated calculations, and 
includes some engineering and administrative practices appropriate to the storage of fissile 
material [27, 28]. 
The tabulated mass limits presented in this section are for idealized storage configurations. While 
these configurations may not be commonly encountered in practice, they do provide bases for 
establishing safe storage arrays. Because this section cannot effectively cover all conditions of 
interest, the use of supplementary information is encouraged [16, 29, 30]. For example, 
subcriticality of arrays not specified in this section may be confirmed by conducting neutron 
source multiplication measurements as described in section 5, Safety in Conducting Subcritical 
Neutron Multiplication Measurements in Situ. 
6.2 
Scope 
This section applies to the storage of fissile materials. Mass and spacing limits are tabulated for 
uranium containing greater than 30 wt-% 235U, for 233U, and for plutonium, as metals and oxides. 
Criteria for the range of application of these limits are provided. 
6.3 
Nuclear criticality safety practices 
6.3.1 
Administrative practices 
All operations with fissile material, including storage, shall be conducted in accordance with 
section 2, Nuclear Criticality Safety in Operations with Fissionable Materials Outside Reactors. 
This section is intended to supplement section 2 by providing storage criteria applicable to many 
fissile materials. If the limits given in this section are used, an adequate administrative margin of 
subcriticality shall be applied to ensure compliance with section 2.1.2.2. 
Methods of storage control and operational practices approved by management shall be described 
in written procedures. Persons participating in the transfer and storage of material shall be 
familiar with these procedures. Limits for storage shall be posted. 
Management shall provide for inspections to verify compliance with established procedures. 
Access to storage areas shall be controlled. 
Additional guidance for administrative practices can be found in section 12, Administrative 
Practices for Nuclear Criticality Safety. 
6.3.2 
Technical practices 
Limits for the storage of fissile material shall be based on experimental data or on the results of 
calculations made through the use of validated computational techniques. 
September 2020 
REGDOC-2.4.3, Nuclear Criticality Safety, Version 1.1 
 
 
39 
 
Storage facilities and structures shall be designed, fabricated, and maintained in accordance with 
good engineering practices. 
The design of storage structures should preclude unacceptable arrangements or configurations, 
thereby reducing reliance on administrative controls. 
Fissile materials shall be stored in such a way that accidental nuclear criticality resulting from fire 
or from flood, earthquake, or other natural calamities is not a concern. 
Storage areas should contain essentially no combustible materials. Where the presence of 
significant quantities of combustible materials is unavoidable, as in the storage of combustible 
scrap, a fire protection system shall be installed. 
Shelving shall be sturdy and non-combustible. Spacing of storage units may be maintained by the 
use of birdcage fixtures, covered metal cans, or physical barriers on shelves. 
Containers of fissile materials in areas with sprinkler systems shall be designed to prevent 
accumulation of water. 
In fissile material storage areas equipped with sprinkler systems, consideration shall be given to 
the possibility of criticality occurring in an accumulation of runoff water from the sprinkler 
system. 
A criticality accident alarm shall be provided in accordance with section 3, Criticality Accident 
Alarm System. 
Good housekeeping shall be incorporated as an important part of nuclear criticality safety 
practices. 
6.4 
Parameters, limits, and conditions 
Tables 6-1 through 6-11 list mass limits for array storage of individual units of specified fissile 
materials. The information given in the tables may be applied directly to the solution of practical 
storage problems. If the limits are found to be unnecessarily restrictive for a particular 
application, they may, at a minimum, serve as lower bounds for comparison with limits derived 
through the use of other techniques. 
The limits were derived and subsequently checked through the use of validated computational 
techniques (see section 2, Nuclear Criticality Safety in Operations with Fissionable Materials 
Outside Reactors) to interpolate within sets of experimental data and to extrapolate from them. 
The validated computational techniques employed provide numerical approximations to the 
solutions of the neutron transport equation for given formulations of neutron cross section data. 
The basis for the limits is a set of calculational results for individual fissile material units in cubic 
arrays [31]. These arrays are reflected on all faces by 200 mm of light water. 
The mass limits in Tables 6-1 through 6-11 yielded evaluated array neutron multiplication factors, 
keff less than 0.95 for their associated cubic array sizes. It should be noted that calculations of 
these arrays through the use of other computational techniques, especially those employing other 
neutron cross section formulations, may yield different array neutron multiplication factors.

REGDOC-2.4.3, Nuclear Criticality Safety, Version 1.1

The units are spheres of the specified fissile materials, characterized by their main isotopic 
constituents, centered in cubic cells: 
1. in the application of limits for uranium enriched in 235U, isotopes other than 238U shall be 
considered as 235U and the material shall not contain more than 1 wt-% 233U 
2. in the application of limits for 233U, other isotopes of uranium shall be considered as 233U 
3. the 239Pu limits of Table 6-8 apply to mixtures of plutonium isotopes [32] if the 
concentration of 240Pu exceeds that of 241Pu and if the 241Pu is considered to be 239Pu in 
computing H/Pu atomic ratios and mass or concentration (see section 2, Nuclear 
Criticality Safety in Operations with Fissionable Materials Outside Reactors) 
4. less restrictive 239Pu limits are provided in Tables 6-9 and 6-10 for isotopic compositions 
containing appreciable concentrations of 240Pu 
The fissile material storage limits presented for the oxides are based on void-free mixtures of the 
dioxides and water at theoretical densities corresponding to the specified ratio of hydrogen to 
fissile element atoms. These limits may be applied to other oxides, fluorides, chlorides, and 
nitrates and to other salts that do not exceed the stated ratio of hydrogen to fissile element atoms 
and that do not exceed the associated fissile element density characteristic of the tabulated 
mixture. 
A number of the tabulated values exceed the critical mass of a water-reflected sphere. Tabulated 
mass limits that exceed 90% of the water-reflected critical mass are indicated in Tables 6-1 
through 6-11. Subcriticality of such units shall be provided by appropriate controls, e.g., 
geometry. 
Caution in the interpretation of the tabulated values is advised. They are intended to specify 
capacities of the cells and must be supplemented by good nuclear criticality safety practices. 
Other operational considerations may dictate smaller limits. 
6.4.1 
Unit mass limits 
The mass of the units shall not exceed the values specified in Tables 6-1 through 6-11. 
6.4.2 
Moderation 
The ratios of hydrogen to fissile material atoms are determined within the fissile region and do 
not include contiguous hydrogenous materials. Margins inherent in the mass limits specified are 
sufficient to compensate for incidental moderation such as that resulting from enclosing each unit 
in a thin plastic bag. The effects of more significant moderation should be evaluated through the 
use of a validated computational technique. 
6.4.3 
Position of unit in cell 
The units shall be centered to within 10% of the cell dimensions. This restriction may be relaxed 
to permit freedom of horizontal position if the unit mass limit is reduced to 60% of the stated 
value. If this reduced value exceeds 20% of the unreflected spherical critical mass of the material, 
the minimum edge-to-edge separation between units shall be 152 mm (6 in.) [33]. 
6.4.4 
Other reflectors 
The mass limits in the tables are also applicable for concrete reflectors up to 127 mm (5 in.) thick 
(the areal density of concrete equals 290 kg/m2 or 60 lb/ft2). The mass limits shall be reduced to 
75% of the tabulated values for a concrete reflector that is 203 mm (8 in) thick and to 60% for 
September 2020 
REGDOC-2.4.3, Nuclear Criticality Safety, Version 1.1 
 
 
41 
 
greater thicknesses of concrete. Equivalent thicknesses of other masonry materials may be 
established on the basis of their areal densities [31]. 
6.4.5 
Double batching 
Double batching of certain tabulated unit masses would, in some geometries, result in 
criticality [34]. Most massive storage units of practical interest, however, would be of much less 
reactive geometry. If a double-batched cell, reflected by water on all its faces, can be shown to 
have a value of keff not exceeding 0.93, such a double-batched cell in an array satisfying the 
tabulated requirements will not result in array criticality. Alternatively, if a double-batched cell 
can be shown to be subcritical when water reflected on all its faces, double batching in a few (8 or 
fewer) cells in an array satisfying the tabulated requirements will not result in array criticality. 
Double batching shall be considered in storage safety analyses and in the establishment of 
operating procedures. If double batching is credible, it shall be determined that double batching in 
a single storage cell will not result in array criticality. Administrative controls, limited capacity 
containers, and storage cell design may be useful for the prevention of double batching. 
6.4.6 
Vault pairs 
Mass limits shall be reduced to 55% of their tabulated values for two contiguous vaults where the 
concrete walls separating and surrounding the storage areas have the same thickness [31]. This 
reduction is sufficient to include the effect of concrete as a reflector. 
The conditions specified in the tables apply to individual storage areas as follows: 
1. two vaults that are separated by a distance not less than the smallest dimension of the 
facing surfaces of the arrays stored within the vaults may be considered as individual 
arrays 
2. two subarrays separated by not less than the smallest dimension of the facing surfaces of 
the subarrays may be evaluated as individual reflected arrays 
6.4.7 
Reduction factors 
The mass reduction factors called for in sections 6.4.3 through 6.4.6, above, are multiplicative. If 
the application of these limits produces an undesirably conservative result, then calculations 
specific to the system of interest should be performed through the use of a validated 
computational technique. Consideration should be given to the precision and any bias in the 
calculational technique used in determining that keff of 0.95 is not exceeded, as described in 
appendix B to this document. 
Increases in cell size to effect reduction factors may be more desirable than decreases in the mass 
limits. 
6.4.8 
Aisles 
Aisles may be provided in the arrays specified in Tables 6-1 through 6-11 by removing units from 
the array or by increasing the total array volume to provide space. The margin of safety is 
adequate to permit personnel within the resultant storage area. 
6.4.9 
Fissile material containment and shelving materials 
The specified limits allow for thicknesses of steel less than 12.7 mm (0.5 in.) as shelving or as 
close-fitting containers in contact with the fissile material or spaced to less than 26 mm (approx. 
September 2020 
REGDOC-2.4.3, Nuclear Criticality Safety, Version 1.1 
 
 
42 
 
1.0 in.) from the fissile material [27]. Effects of greater thicknesses of steel or of other materials 
shall be investigated experimentally or by applying validated computational techniques. 
6.4.10 Unit subcriticality 
The contents of each storage cell shall be subcritical if fully reflected with water. 
6.4.11 Unit spacing 
Where flooding is credible, unit surface separations shall be at least 152 mm (6 in.). 
6.4.12 Unit shape 
The mass limits may be applied to units of any shape. 
6.5 
Other applications 
The tabulated limits are not directly applicable to all systems of interest. When the provisions of 
section 6.4 are satisfied, application of the tabulated mass limits may be extended as described in 
this section. 
6.5.1 
Commingling of dissimilar cells 
Each cell within any array described in tables 6-1 through 6-11 is assigned an index equal to the 
quotient of 100 and the number of cells in the array [33]. Commingling, in one array, of any of 
the cells is permitted if the aggregate of the indexes of all the cells within the resultant array does 
not exceed 100. 
6.5.2 
Interpolation 
Interpolation may be made among mass limits, number of cells, and hydrogen content. 
Interpolation of 235U enrichment is permitted. Linear interpolation is not necessarily appropriate. 
6.5.3 
Non-cubic cells 
Any tabulated mass limit may be applied to a non-cubic cell equal in volume to that tabulated 
containing a near-equilateral unit if the largest dimension of the cell does not exceed the smallest 
by more than a factor of 2.5 [33]. 
The tabulated values may be applied to other than near-equilateral units in non-cubic cells if the 
unit and cell volumes are maintained and if the ratio of the dimensions that characterize the shape 
of the unit is approximately equal to the ratio of the corresponding dimensions of the cell. 
6.5.4 
Position of unit in cell 
Units placed in non-cubic cells shall be centered to within 10% of the smallest cell dimension. 
This restriction may be relaxed to permit freedom of horizontal position if the mass limit is 
reduced to 60% of the tabulated value [33]. If this reduced value exceeds 20% of the unreflected 
spherical critical mass of the material, the minimum edge-to-edge separation between units shall 
be 152 mm (6 in.). 
6.5.5 
Array shape 
The tabulated limits may be applied to arrays of any shape.

6.5.6 
238Plutonium 
The tabulated mass limits for plutonium containing 5.2 wt-% 240Pu (see Table 6-9) may be 
applied to the storage of units of any non-fissile 238Pu content [35]. The footnote to Tables 6-7 
through 6-10 regarding 90% of the water-reflected critical spherical mass is appropriate for 238Pu 
(see section 10, Nuclear Criticality Safety Control of Selected Actinide Nuclides).

Criteria for Nuclear Criticality Safety Controls in Operations with Shielding and 
Confinement 
Some parts of this section are extracted from ANSI/ANS-8.10-2015, Criteria for Nuclear 
Criticality Safety Controls in Operations with Shielding and Confinement, with permission of the 
publisher, the American Nuclear Society. The text may have been adapted to make it applicable 
to Canada’s international obligations to IAEA and consistent with CNSC’s regulatory 
requirements. 
7.1 
Introduction 
Section 2, Nuclear Criticality Safety in Operations with Fissionable Materials Outside Reactors, 
provides information on the prevention of criticality accidents in the handling, storing, 
processing, and transporting of fissionable materials. Section 2.3.2.1 states, in part, that 
“Distinction may be made between shielded and unshielded facilities, and the criteria may be less 
stringent when adequate shielding and confinement assure the protection of personnel.” 
Section 7 (this section) recognizes that, if adequate shielding against radiation and confinement of 
radioactive materials are provided, the hazards normally attendant with criticality in a facility 
lacking shielding and confinement are minimized. 
This section provides criteria for: 
1. the prevention of nuclear criticality accidents in facilities with shielding and confinement, 
and 
2. the adequacy of the required shielding and confinement 
This section does not apply to those operations requiring entry of personnel inside the shielded 
process areas wherein fissile and fissionable materials are contained. This section does not 
include engineering specifications for shield design nor for establishing its adequacy. Nothing in 
this section shall be interpreted as discouraging additional safety features that can be conveniently 
incorporated. 
7.2 
Scope 
This section applies to operations, with 235U, 233U, 239Pu and other fissile and fissionable materials 
outside of nuclear reactors, in which shielding and confinement are provided for protection of 
personnel and the public, except the assembly of these materials under controlled conditions, such 
as in critical experiments. Criteria are provided that may be used for criticality control under these 
conditions. This section does not include the details of administrative procedures for control 
(which are considered to be management prerogatives) or details regarding the design of 
processes and equipment or descriptions of instrumentation for process control. 
7.3 
Criteria for adequate shielding and confinement 
7.3.1 
Conditions 
The provisions of this section may be applied only in those shielded facilities that meet the 
following criteria: 
1. all operations and manipulations involving fissile and fissionable materials are conducted 
remotely by persons located outside the shielded area, and 
September 2020 
REGDOC-2.4.3, Nuclear Criticality Safety, Version 1.1 
 
 
54 
 
2. shielding and confinement provided are adequate to meet the radiation dose limits set 
forth in section 7.3.2 
Thus, a storage vault does not qualify unless additions or withdrawals of the fissile material are 
made by remotely operated devices. The criteria that are presented herein consider only the 
adequacy of the shielding and confinement for criticality accidents. Additional shielding may be 
required by the process conditions. 
7.3.2 
Adequacy of shielding and confinement 
Shielding and confinement are considered adequate when the following conditions are satisfied 
during and subsequent to an accident. However, better shielding and confinement are desirable if 
practical. 
7.3.2.1 Radiation dose 
For design evaluation purposes, the radiation source strengths and releases may be estimated by 
detailed analysis of criticality accidents. 
The shielding and confinement shall be such that, following a criticality accident, the whole-body 
radiation dose [36] received by an individual located at any point outside the shielded and 
confined area will not exceed the effective dose set out in column 3 of item 1(a) of 
subsection 13(1) of the Radiation Protection Regulations. 
In addition, the shielding and confinement shall be such that the off-site consequences of a 
criticality accident, as calculated from the start of the accident, do not violate criteria established 
as a trigger for a temporary public sheltering by Canadian Guidelines for Intervention during a 
Nuclear Emergency [4]. 
7.3.2.2 Shielding and confinement criterion 
The shielding and confinement system of a facility shall be designed to limit the dose resulting 
from exposure to direct radiation and to radionuclides released from the facility following a 
criticality accident, to that specified by section 7.3.2.1. 
7.3.2.3 Structural integrity 
The shielding and confinement system shall be designed to withstand physical damage that could 
cause breach of confinement or injury to personnel in the event of a criticality accident. 
7.3.2.4 Space in lieu of shielding 
If personnel are located remotely from the fissile and fissionable materials, distance may serve in 
lieu of some or all of the shielding, provided personnel entry into the intervening space is 
constrained and the other conditions set forth in section 7.3.2 are met. 
7.4 
Criticality safety practices 
Where shielding and confinement satisfy the criteria of section 7.3, the consequences of criticality 
accidents are primarily damage to equipment, disruption of processes, spillage of product, 
contamination of facilities, or other similar consequences. 
Additional guidance for administrative practices can be found in section 12, Administrative 
Practices for Nuclear Criticality Safety.

7.4.1 
Single contingency operation 
The double contingency principle (described in section 2.3.2.2) recommends that at least two 
unlikely, independent, and concurrent changes in process conditions occur before nuclear 
criticality is possible. The number of contingencies may be reduced to unity where the principles 
of this section are met and the probability of failure of any primary control is shown to be low. 
The use of a single contingency should be kept to a minimum; examples of primary methods of 
control that may constitute acceptable single contingency operation include: 
 
Soluble neutron absorber: reliance on maintaining the prescribed concentration of 
absorbers, such as boron, gadolinium, or cadmium, the loss of which by precipitation or 
other means would likely result in a criticality accident 
 
Concentration control: reliance on maintaining the prescribed concentration of the 
fissionable nuclide in a solution at a subcritical level 
 
Chemical form: reliance on maintaining the prescribed concentration of nitrate (NO3) or 
sulphate (SO4) or other ions in a solution of fissionable nuclides 
 
Reflectors: reliance on maintaining prescribed reflector conditions; for example, the 
exclusion of water flooding 
 
Fission products: reliance on maintaining the prescribed concentration of fission 
products associated with the fissionable nuclides 
 
Geometry control: reliance on maintaining the prescribed geometry of the process 
material 
 
Isotopic composition of fissionable material: reliance on maintaining the prescribed 
concentrations of fissile and nonfissile material 
 
Spacing: reliance on maintaining the prescribed spacing between discrete units of fissile 
material 
If criticality prevention is dependent primarily on administrative action for control, i.e., where 
improper performance of a required routine operation on the part of an individual might lead to 
criticality (such as failing to add soluble neutron absorber or exceeding a safe batch limit), then 
procedures shall be established to ensure that no single administrative error on the part of any one 
individual leads to criticality.

Nuclear Criticality Control and Safety of Plutonium-Uranium Fuel Mixtures 
Outside Reactors 
Some parts of this section are extracted from ANSI/ANS-8.12-1987 (reaffirmed in 2016), 
Nuclear Criticality Control and Safety of Plutonium-Uranium Fuel Mixtures Outside Reactors, 
with permission of the publisher, the American Nuclear Society. The text may have been adapted 
to make it applicable to Canada’s international obligations to IAEA and consistent with CNSC’s 
regulatory requirements. 
8.1 
Introduction 
Section 2, Nuclear Criticality Safety in Operations with Fissionable Materials Outside Reactors, 
provides single-parameter limits for fissionable units of simple shape containing 233U, 235Uand 
239Pu. As an example of multi-parameter control, it provides an increase in the limits of 235U 
resulting from control of the amount of 238U associated with 235U in uranium metal and oxide 
enriched to no more than 5 wt% 235U. Larger limits for plutonium likewise result from placing 
reliance on, and hence controlling, the isotopic concentration of 240Pu and the amount of uranium 
associated with the plutonium. Such increases may prove valuable for operations with mixed 
oxides of plutonium and uranium encountered in light water, liquid metal fast breeder, gas-cooled 
fast reactor, etc, fuel cycle operations. 
The limits provided here were calculated [37, 38] by methods satisfying the requirements for 
validation of a calculational method as set forth in section 2.3.4. 
The administrative and technical practices for criticality safety and control as embodied in 
section 2 and section 12, Administrative Practices for Nuclear Criticality Safety, are applicable 
herein. 
8.2 
Scope 
Section 8 (this section) is applicable to operations with plutonium-uranium oxide fuel mixtures 
outside nuclear reactors, except the assembly of these materials under controlled conditions, such 
as in critical experiments. Basic criteria are presented for plutonium-uranium fuel mixtures in 
single units of simple shape containing no more than 30 wt% plutonium combined with uranium 
containing no more than 0.71 wt% 235U. The limits for uniform aqueous mixtures (solution) are 
applicable to homogeneous mixtures and slurries in which the particles constituting the mixture 
are uniformly distributed and have a diameter no larger than 127 µm (0.005 in.), i.e., are capable 
of being passed through 120 mesh screen. 
This section does not include the details of administrative controls, the design of processes or 
equipment, the description of instrumentation for process control or detailed criteria to be met in 
transporting fissionable materials. 
8.3 
Nuclear criticality safety practices 
8.3.1 
Administrative and technical practices 
Operations within the scope of this section shall be conducted in accordance with section 2. If the 
limits for plutonium-uranium mixtures given herein are used, an adequate administrative margin 
of subcriticality shall be applied to ensure compliance with section 2.3.2.2. Attention shall be 
given to credible abnormal conditions such as those listed in Appendix A. 
September 2020 
REGDOC-2.4.3, Nuclear Criticality Safety, Version 1.1 
 
 
57 
 
Additional guidance for administrative practices can be found in section 12, Administrative 
Practices for Nuclear Criticality Safety. 
8.3.2 
Homogeneity control 
Consideration shall be given to the possibility of preferential separation of plutonium from 
uranium. Neither the limits for homogeneous systems nor those for heterogeneous systems apply 
unless the plutonium and uranium oxides remain intimately and homogeneously mixed. 
8.4 
Subcritical limits for uniform, homogeneous plutonium-uranium mixtures in water 
Operations with the fuel mixtures specified may be performed safely by complying with any one 
of the subcritical limits given in Tables 8-1, 8-2, or 8-3, provided the conditions under which the 
limit applies are maintained. 
A limit shall be applied only when the effect of neutron reflectors and other nearby fissionable 
materials is no greater than that of a contiguous water reflector of effectively infinite thickness. 
Process specifications shall incorporate margins to protect against uncertainties in process 
variables and against a limit being accidentally exceeded. 
8.4.1 
Homogeneous aqueous mixtures 
The limits of Table 8-1 are applicable to homogeneous mixtures of oxides of natural uranium and 
plutonium provided the plutonium oxide content of the mixture of oxides is between 3 wt% and 
30 wt%. Limits are provided for three isotopic compositions of plutonium. In applying these 
limits, any 238Pu and 242Pu present shall be omitted in computing the isotopic composition. All 
limits in Table 8-1 are valid for homogeneous mixtures of plutonium and uranium containing no 
more than 0.71 wt% of (235U plus 239Pu). 
8.4.2 
Variation of subcritical limits with PuO2 content 
The limits of Table 8-1 are appropriate for criticality prevention. 
8.4.3 
Dry and damp mixed-oxide powders 
The limits given in Table 8-2 apply to dry and damp mixtures of the oxides of plutonium and 
natural uranium provided the concentration of 240Pu exceeds that of 241Pu. Because completely 
dry oxide may be difficult to ensure, limits are provided for damp oxides in which 
0 < H : (Pu + U) ≤ 0.45. (1.48 wt% water corresponds to an H : (Pu + U) ≈ 0.45). Limits are also 
provided for oxide powders with 50% voids. 
8.4.4 
Limiting concentrations of plutonium in unlimited quantities of mixtures of the 
oxides and nitrates of plutonium and natural uranium 
The maximum safe concentrations of plutonium in (PuO2 + UO2) or in (Pu(NO3)4 + UO2(NO3)2) 
in unlimited quantity under the stated conditions are given in Table 8-3. In each case, the value of 
the infinite multiplication factor, k∞, is less than unity for these conditions and is independent of 
the density of the mixture. For example, criticality cannot be achieved in a homogeneous mixture 
of (PuO2 + UO2) in water if the plutonium content is ≤ 0.13 wt% of the combined mass of the 
(Pu + U) in the oxides. These limits are not applicable to mixtures of elemental plutonium and 
uranium in water.

8.5 
Subcritical limits for mixed-oxide heterogeneous systems 
Lumping the mixed-oxide fuel produces an effect on criticality similar to that which occurs in 
natural or moderately enriched uranium. The total absorption in 238U and 240Pu resonances in the 
mixed oxide is minimized if the mixed oxide is separated from the moderator, e.g., in a lattice 
assembly of fuel rods in water, as compared to an aqueous homogeneous mixture of the oxides. 
Because of the decreased absorption of the 240Pu as a result of lumping, the effect of 240Pu on the 
subcritical limit also can be expected to be smaller than in the case of aqueous homogeneous 
mixtures. 
Subcritical limits are specified in ANSI/ANS 8-12 as a function of both the PuO2 content in the 
mixed oxides and the 240Pu content of the plutonium. In applying these limits, any 238Pu and 242Pu 
present shall be excluded when computing isotopic composition. Those limits are applicable to 
heterogeneous systems regardless of the size or shape of the mixed oxide pieces or degree of 
moderation by water. 
Process specifications shall incorporate margins to protect against uncertainties in process 
variables and against a limit being accidentally exceeded.

Use of Soluble Neutron Absorbers in Nuclear Facilities Outside Reactors 
Some parts of this section are extracted from ANSI/ANS-8.14-2004 (reaffirmed in 2016), Use of 
Soluble Neutron Absorbers in Nuclear Facilities Outside Reactors, with permission of the 
publisher, the American Nuclear Society. The text may have been adapted to make it applicable 
to Canada’s international obligations to IAEA and consistent with CNSC’s regulatory 
requirements. 
9.1 
Introduction 
Guidance for criticality control in process and handling operations with fissile material was 
presented in section 2, Nuclear Criticality Safety in Operations with Fissionable Materials 
Outside Reactors. However, for solutions, the single parameter subcritical limits on unit mass, 
volume, concentration, and geometric dimensions can be highly restrictive. Significantly larger 
limits are possible if soluble neutron absorbers are present in such solutions. 
Experience has shown that operations involving the use of such absorbers can be performed both 
safely and economically. 
9.2 
Scope 
Section 9 (this section) provides specific guidance for the use of soluble neutron absorbers for 
criticality control, and also addresses neutron absorber selection, system design and 
modifications, safety evaluations, and quality assurance programs. Note that section 2 provides 
general guidance for the use of soluble neutron absorbers for criticality accident prevention. 
When soluble neutron absorbers are present, but are not required for nuclear criticality safety, 
their use is outside the scope of this section. The required guidance addressing specific 
applications of neutron absorbers can be found in section 4, Use of Borosilicate-Glass Raschig 
Rings as a Neutron Absorber in Solutions of Fissile Material, and section 14, Use of Fixed 
Neutron Absorbers in Nuclear Facilities Outside Reactors. 
9.3 
Administrative requirements and guidance 
Requirements and guidance for the use of soluble neutron absorbers as a criticality safety control 
are grouped under five topics: 
 
soluble neutron absorber selection 
 
system design and modification 
 
safety evaluations 
 
quality assurance program 
 
facility operations with soluble absorbers 
9.3.1 
Selection of a soluble neutron absorber 
When selecting a soluble neutron absorber, the following considerations shall be taken into 
account: 
1. selection of a soluble neutron absorber shall include assessment of the operating 
environment and of the chemical compatibility of the neutron absorber with the process 
for which it is to be used; consideration shall be given to the solubility of the neutron 
September 2020 
REGDOC-2.4.3, Nuclear Criticality Safety, Version 1.1 
 
 
63 
 
absorber and to materials and conditions (e.g., temperature and pressure) that could cause 
precipitation or plateout of the neutron absorber 
2. the soluble neutron absorber shall maintain its minimum required neutron absorption 
capability during its intended operating life 
3. selection of a soluble neutron absorber shall include an assessment of the absorber 
effectiveness under credible conditions of neutron moderation and reflection 
4. selection of a neutron absorber shall include evaluation of radiation effects (e.g., 
depletion by neutron absorption, radiolysis) over its operating life 
5. selection of a soluble neutron absorber shall include evaluation of the requirements of 
operations and of fissile material accountability 
Selection of a soluble neutron absorber should include evaluation of the requirements of other 
safety disciplines. 
9.3.2 
System design and system modifications 
The following requirements shall apply to both system design and system modifications: 
1. for the range evaluated as subcritical, the system design shall prevent inadvertent 
concentration of fissile solution and removal or dilution of the neutron absorber 
2. for the range evaluated as subcritical, the system design shall account for potential 
degradation of the neutron absorber and the chemicals used to dissolve or stabilize the 
neutron absorber 
3. the system design shall consider the need for inspection, sampling, and verification of the 
adequacy of the neutron absorbing capability prior to use and during the operational 
lifetime of the neutron absorber 
4. a means of verification shall be provided to determine that the system design, safety, and 
operating requirements are met for all operations that utilize soluble neutron absorbers 
The design of the system equipment incorporating soluble neutron absorbers should incorporate 
human factors engineering practices for preparation, use, and control of the neutron absorber. 
9.3.3 
Nuclear criticality safety evaluations 
Nuclear criticality safety evaluations (NCSE) shall: 
1. include allowances for uncertainties in the neutron absorber concentration, distribution, 
and neutronic properties (i.e., accuracy of neutron cross section values) 
2. include equipment design tolerances, chemical reaction tolerances, material substitutions, 
geometry changes, modeling assumptions, process variables, neutron absorber isotopic 
distribution, and relevant uncertainties 
3. consider the potential for neutron absorber degradation in the normal operating 
environment due to physical or chemical actions and solution composition changes 
4. consider the effect on nuclear criticality safety of potential non-uniform distribution of 
the neutron absorber 
5. consider the impact on the neutron absorber, and subsequent effect on system reactivity, 
of changes to process conditions that lead to adverse environmental and operating 
conditions (e.g., radiolysis, chemical reactions, temperature variations, changes in 
pressure, depletion, and dilution) 
6. consider worst-case credible concentrations of both soluble absorber and fissile materials 
for operations involving the dissolution of fissile material 
September 2020

64 
 
7. be based on data from applicable experiments or validated calculations in accordance 
with section 2 
9.3.4 
Quality management program 
A quality management (QM) program that meets the applicable requirements of ANSI/ASME 
NQA-1-2015, Quality Assurance Requirements for Nuclear Facility Applications [11], 
CSA N286-12, Management System Requirements for Nuclear Facilities [12], or equivalent, shall 
be established to implement the activities specified in this section. 
A documented QM program shall be implemented for soluble neutron absorber acquisition, 
storage, preparation, and use. The program should conform to the licensee’s QM program. 
Records of the associated operations shall be maintained for the operating life of the facility. 
The QM program for soluble neutron absorbers should include a combination of inspections, 
tests, sample analyses, and verifications. Actions taken as a result of the program shall not 
compromise the nuclear criticality safety of the operating system. 
The frequencies of inspection, testing, sampling, and verification prior to use and during the 
operational lifetime of the neutron absorber shall be established such that they allow 
determination of the adequacy of the neutron absorbing capability. The frequencies shall allow 
sufficient time for corrective actions to be taken if absorbing capability shows degradation from 
established values. Factors that shall be considered include the environment in which the neutron 
absorbers are placed and the absorber material’s chemical, physical, and other properties on 
which the NCSE is based. 
Testing and sample analysis methods to verify neutron absorber concentrations and properties 
credited in the NCSE, prior to use and while in service, shall be calibrated using traceable 
standards. 
9.3.5 
Facility operation with soluble absorbers 
Prior to operation, the parameters of the system design important to criticality safety shall be 
verified to conform to specifications. 
Proper mixing and concentration of the soluble neutron absorber (elemental or isotopic, as 
appropriate) shall be verified before use.

Nuclear Criticality Safety Control of Selected Actinide Nuclides 
Some parts of this section are extracted from ANSI/ANS-8.15-2014, Nuclear Criticality Safety 
Control of Selected Actinide Nuclides (reaffirmed in 2019), with permission of the publisher, the 
American Nuclear Society. The text may have been adapted to make it applicable to Canada’s 
international obligations to IAEA and consistent with CNSC’s regulatory requirements. 
10.1 
Introduction 
Section 2, Nuclear Criticality Safety in Operations with Fissionable Materials Outside Reactors, 
provides single-parameter limits for operations with 233U, 235U, and 239Pu. The principal interest in 
criticality safety is in these isotopes of uranium and plutonium because they are the most 
abundant. However, other isotopes of these nuclides and other elements within the actinide group 
are capable of supporting a chain reaction, and these isotopes and elements may be encountered 
in sufficient quantities to cause concern. 
Pertaining to criticality safety, a key factor is whether the nuclide contains an odd or even number 
of neutrons. Those with odd numbers of neutrons, such as 24194Pu, 242m95Am, 24396Cm, 24596Cm, 
24796Cm, 24998Cf, and 25198Cf can be expected to have critical masses in aqueous solutions that are 
less than 1 kg, and in certain cases, very much less. 
Those with even numbers of neutrons, for example, 23793Np, 23894Pu, 24094Pu, 24294Pu, 24195Am, 
24395Am, and 24496Cm, can in many cases be made critical, but the mass required may be 
kilograms. The effect of moderation on these nuclides, such as in an aqueous solution, is to 
prevent (rather than enhance) criticality. These nuclides characteristically exhibit rather sharp 
thresholds in their fission cross sections, with little or no probability for sub-threshold fission. As 
a consequence, the value of k∞ is reduced if even a small quantity of hydrogen is mixed uniformly 
with the element. 
10.2 
Scope 
Section 10 (this section) is applicable to operations with the following: 23292U, 23492U, 23793Np, 
23694Pu, 23894Pu, 24094Pu, 24194Pu, 24294Pu, 24195Am, 242m95Am, 24395Am, 24296Cm, 24396Cm, 24496Cm, 
24596Cm, 24696Cm, 24796Cm, 24998Cf, and 25198Cf. 
Subcritical mass limits are presented for isolated fissionable units. The limits are not applicable to 
interacting units. 
10.3 
Nuclear criticality safety practices 
Operations within the scope of this section shall be conducted in accordance with section 2. If the 
limits given herein are used, an adequate administrative margin of subcriticality shall be applied 
to ensure compliance with section 2.3.2.2. Attention shall be given to credible abnormal 
conditions (examples of such conditions are given in appendix A). 
Additional guidance for administrative practices can be found in section 12, Administrative 
Practices for Nuclear Criticality Safety.

10.4 
Single parameter limits for selected actinide nuclides 
Operations may be performed safely by complying with the appropriate subcritical mass limits 
given in sections 10.4.1, 10.4.2 and 10.4.4 or the appropriate concentration limits given in 
section 10.4.3. 
Note: Process specifications shall incorporate margins to protect against uncertainties in process 
variables and against a limit being accidentally exceeded. 
10.4.1 Spherical metal systems 
The appropriate mass limits of Table 10-1 are applicable only when the surrounding materials can 
be shown to be no more effective at increasing neutron multiplication than enclosing the unit in a 
contiguous layer of the reflector to which the limit corresponds. For example, to apply the water-
reflected mass limit to a reflector other than water, it must be demonstrated that the system is less 
reactive with the surrounding material than with a water reflector. 
10.4.2 Metal-water mixtures 
The appropriate mass limits of Table 10-2 are applicable to aqueous solutions and slurries, which 
may be non-uniform, provided surrounding material can be shown to increase keff no more than 
would result from enclosing the unit by a contiguous layer of water to which the limit 
corresponds. 
10.4.3 Diluted solutions 
For operations with diluted solutions, the subcritical concentration limits and the associated 
minimum hydrogen-to-fissile atom ratios given in Table 10-3 may be used. Table 10-3 provides 
the ratios for 19 selected nuclides in homogeneous metal-water mixtures. 
10.4.4 Operations with oxides 
For operations with oxides, the subcritical mass limits for seven selected oxides are given in 
Table 10-4 provided the surrounding material can be shown to be no more effective at increasing 
neutron multiplication than enclosing the unit in a contiguous layer of the reflector to which the 
limit corresponds. 
10.5 
Isotopic mixtures of Pu, Am and Cm 
10.5.1 Isotopic mixtures of plutonium 
In PuO2-H2O mixtures, regardless of the H/Pu atomic ratio, a subcritical limit of 8 kg of 
plutonium is valid provided: 
1. the plutonium contains at least 67% 238Pu, and 
2. the isotopic concentration of 241Pu is less than that of 240Pu, and 
3. the surrounding materials, including other nearby fissionable materials, can be shown to 
increase keff no more than enclosing the unit by a contiguous layer of water of unlimited 
thickness 
10.5.2 Adding 241AmO2 to 242mAmO2 
The addition of 241Am to 242mAm increases the permissible quantities of 242mAm to the values 
given in Table 10-5. Any 243Am present may be ignored; it provides a small additional margin of 
subcriticality. At less than 5 wt% 242mAm, the limit of Table 10-1 for 241AmO2 applies.

Criticality Safety Criteria for the Handling, Storage, and Transportation of LWR Fuel Outside 
Reactors, with permission of the publisher, the American Nuclear Society. The text may have 
been adapted to make it applicable to Canada’s international obligations to IAEA and consistent 
with CNSC’s regulatory requirements.

Transport of Nuclear Substances Regulations, 2015 [43] 
11.1 
Introduction 
The potential for criticality accidents during the handling, transportation, storage, and long-term 
waste management of fuel for nuclear reactors represents a health and safety risk to personnel 
involved in these activities, as well as to the general public. Within the boundaries of the licensed 
site, appropriate design of equipment and facilities, handling procedures, and personnel training 
can minimize this risk. 
11.2 
Scope 
Section 2, Nuclear Criticality Safety in Operations with Fissionable Materials Outside Reactors, 
provides general criteria for assurance of criticality safety. Section 11 (this section) provides 
additional information applicable to handling, transportation, storage, and long-term waste 
management of reactor fuel units in any phase of the fuel cycle outside the reactor core and 
within the boundaries of the licensed site. 
11.3 
General safety criteria 
General administrative and technical practices are described in section 2.  
At a licensed site for short- or interim-term (dry or wet) storage, an exempted quantity of 
fissionable materials (defined in section 2.3.1.1, list item 2) may include an unlimited quantity of 
natural or depleted uranium irradiated in a thermal nuclear reactor [6]. 
Methods used to calculate subcriticality shall be validated in accordance with section 2. 
Guidance to determine the need for and use of criticality alarms for personnel protection is 
described in section 3, Criticality Accident Alarm System. 
September 2020 
REGDOC-2.4.3, Nuclear Criticality Safety, Version 1.1 
 
 
72 
 
11.3.1 Process analysis 
Prior to first use of, or before implementing changes to, any operation or system involving 
handling, transportation, storage, or long-term waste management of fuel units or rods, a nuclear 
criticality safety evaluation (NCSE) shall be performed for all normal and credible abnormal 
conditions to determine that the entire operation or system will be subcritical based on the criteria 
contained in section 11.4 as further specified in section 2.3.2.2. The NCSE shall explicitly 
identify the controlled parameters and their design and operating limits upon which nuclear 
criticality safety depends. 
The NCSE shall be documented with sufficient detail, clarity, and lack of ambiguity to allow 
independent judgment of results. 
Representative parameters and conditions for fuel unit handling, on-site transportation, on-site 
storage, and on-site long-term waste management are listed in appendix E. 
11.3.2 Pre-commencement 
Prior to commencing operation, an independent assessment shall be conducted that confirms the 
adequacy of the evaluation required by section 11.3.1. 
Prior to commencing operation, the licensee shall verify that the as-built conditions conform to 
the design limits as identified in section 11.3.1. 
11.3.3 Neutron-absorbing materials 
Reliance may be placed on neutron-absorbing materials, such as gadolinium and boron that are 
incorporated in the fuel material itself, or in structures or equipment, or in both. However, when 
reliance is placed on neutron-absorbing materials, control shall be exercised to maintain their 
continued presence with the intended distributions and concentrations. Extraordinary care should 
be taken with solutions of absorbers because of the difficulty of exercising such control and with 
fuel units containing burnable poison to identify the maximum reactivity condition to be 
considered. 
11.3.4 Composition and nuclear characteristics of fuel 
In performing the NCSE, the composition and nuclear characteristics of the fuel shall be those 
resulting in the maximum neutron multiplication factor of the system. Credit may be taken for 
fuel burnup by: 
1. establishing a maximum fuel unit reactivity, and 
2. assuring that each fuel unit has a reactivity no greater than the maximum established 
reactivity by: 
 
a reactivity measurement, or 
 
analysis and verification of the exposure history of each fuel unit 
Consideration shall be given to the axial distribution of burnup in the fuel unit. 
11.3.5 Transport 
The fuel unit and rods should be handled, transported, stored, and placed in long-term waste 
management in a manner providing a sufficient factor of safety to require at least two unlikely, 
independent, and concurrent changes in conditions before a criticality accident is possible.

11.4 
Criteria to establish subcriticality 
Where methods of analysis are used to predict neutron multiplication factors, the calculated 
multiplication factor, k, shall be equal to or less than an established upper subcritical limit (USL), 
as detailed in appendix B.

Administrative Practices for Nuclear Criticality Safety 
Some parts of this section are extracted from ANSI/ANS-8.19-2014 (reaffirmed in 2019), 
Administrative Practices for Nuclear Criticality Safety, with permission of the publisher, the 
American Nuclear Society. The text may have been adapted to make it applicable to Canada’s 
international obligations to IAEA and consistent with CNSC’s regulatory requirements. 
12.1 
Introduction 
An effective nuclear criticality safety program includes cooperation among management, 
supervision, and the nuclear criticality safety staff. For each employee, the program relies upon 
conformance with operating procedures. 
Although the extent and complexity of safety-related activities may vary greatly with the size and 
type of operation with fissionable material, certain safety elements are common. Section 12 (this 
section) codifies such elements related to criticality safety. 
12.2 
Scope 
This section provides criteria for the administration of a nuclear criticality safety program for 
operations outside reactors for which there exists a potential for criticality accidents. 
Responsibilities of management, supervision, and the nuclear criticality safety staff are addressed. 
Objectives and characteristics of operating and emergency procedures are included. 
General guidance for nuclear criticality safety can be found in section 2, Nuclear Criticality 
Safety in Operations with Fissionable Materials outside Reactors. Guidance for selected isotopes 
that are fissionable can be found in section 10, Nuclear Criticality Safety Control of Selected 
Actinide Nuclides. 
12.3 
Responsibilities 
12.3.1 Management responsibilities 
Management shall: 
1. accept overall responsibility for safety of operations and provide regular and systematic 
oversight 
2. formulate nuclear criticality safety policy and make it known to all employees involved 
in operations with fissionable material. Distinction may be made between shielded and 
unshielded facilities, with appropriate criticality controls in all cases 
3. assign responsibility and delegate commensurate authority to implement established 
policy; responsibility for nuclear criticality safety should be assigned in a manner 
compatible with that for other safety disciplines; each individual, regardless of position, 
shall be made aware that nuclear criticality safety in their work area is their responsibility 
4. provide personnel familiar with the physics of nuclear criticality and with associated 
safety practices to furnish technical guidance appropriate to the scope of operations; this 
function should, to the extent practicable, be administratively independent of operations 
5. establish a method of monitoring the nuclear criticality safety program 
6. periodically participate in auditing the overall effectiveness of the nuclear criticality 
safety program 
September 2020 
REGDOC-2.4.3, Nuclear Criticality Safety, Version 1.1 
 
 
75 
 
7. establish a defined process and procedures for equipment change control [9] 
8. establish operating procedures and a process for modifying those procedures [9] 
Management may use consultants and nuclear criticality safety committees to achieve the 
objectives of the nuclear criticality safety program. 
12.3.2 Supervisory responsibilities 
Each supervisor shall: 
1. accept responsibility for the safety of operations under their control 
2. be knowledgeable in those aspects of nuclear criticality safety relevant to operations 
under their control; training and assistance should be obtained from the nuclear criticality 
safety staff 
3. provide training and require that personnel under their supervision have an understanding 
of procedures and safety considerations such that they may be expected to perform their 
functions without undue risk; information on a nuclear criticality safety training program 
may be obtained from section 13, Nuclear Criticality Safety Training; records of training 
activities and verification of personnel understanding shall be maintained 
4. develop or participate in the development of written procedures applicable to the 
operations under their control; maintenance of these procedures to reflect changes in 
operations shall be a continuing supervisory responsibility 
5. require conformance with good safety practices including unambiguous identification of 
fissionable materials and good housekeeping 
6. be responsible for the inspection, testing and maintenance of engineered controls 
Each supervisor also verifies compliance with nuclear criticality safety specifications for new or 
modified equipment before its use. Verification may be based on inspection reports or other 
features of the quality assurance program. 
Supervisors may obtain assistance for fulfilling the responsibilities outlined in list items 3 through 
6, above, from other functions such as facility operations and maintenance. 
12.3.3 Nuclear criticality safety staff responsibilities 
The nuclear criticality safety staff (NCS staff) shall: 
1. provide, and accept responsibility for, technical guidance in the design of equipment and 
processes and for the development of operating procedures [9] 
2. maintain familiarity with current developments in nuclear criticality safety standards, 
guides, and codes; knowledge of current nuclear criticality information should be 
maintained; the NCS staff should consult with knowledgeable individuals to obtain 
technical assistance as needed 
3. maintain familiarity with all operations within the organization requiring nuclear 
criticality safety controls 
4. assist supervisors, on request, in training personnel 
5. conduct or participate in audits of criticality safety practices and compliance with 
procedures as directed by management 
6. examine reports of procedural violations and other deficiencies, for possible 
improvement of safety practices and procedural requirements, and shall report their 
findings to management 
September 2020 
REGDOC-2.4.3, Nuclear Criticality Safety, Version 1.1 
 
 
76 
 
7. upon request, participate in the verification of compliance with nuclear criticality-safety 
specifications for intended new or modified processes or equipment [9] 
12.4 
Operating procedures 
The purpose of written operating procedures is to facilitate and document the safe and efficient 
conduct of the operation. Procedures should be organized for convenient use by operators and be 
easily available. They should be free of extraneous material. Copies of applicable written 
procedures should be posted up or available in operating areas [7]. 
Procedures shall include those controls and limits significant to nuclear criticality safety. 
Procedures should be such that no single inadvertent departure from a procedure can cause a 
criticality accident. 
Supplementing and revising procedures, as improvements become desirable, shall be facilitated. 
Operating procedures shall be reviewed periodically by supervisory personnel. 
New or revised procedures that affect nuclear criticality safety shall be reviewed by the NCS staff 
and by the supervisory personnel, and shall be approved by management [9]. 
Deviations from operating procedures and unforeseen alterations in process conditions that affect 
nuclear criticality safety shall be reported to management, investigated promptly, corrected as 
appropriate, and documented. Action shall be taken to prevent a recurrence. 
Operations shall be reviewed frequently (at least annually) to ascertain that procedures are being 
followed and that process conditions have not been altered so as to affect the nuclear criticality 
safety evaluation (NCSE). These reviews shall be conducted, in consultation with operating 
personnel, by individuals who are knowledgeable in criticality safety and who, to the extent 
practicable, are not immediately responsible for the operation. 
Personnel should be encouraged to provide feedback on the nuclear criticality safety program, 
including: 
 
identification of concerns or circumstances that could adversely affect nuclear criticality 
safety 
 
practices that support nuclear criticality safety 
 
identification of potential improvements 
12.5 
Process evaluation for nuclear criticality safety (nuclear criticality safety evaluation) 
Before the start of a new operation with fissionable material, or before an existing operation is 
changed, it shall be determined and documented that the entire process is subcritical under both 
normal and credible abnormal conditions. 
The NCSE shall determine and explicitly identify the controlled parameters and their associated 
limits upon which nuclear criticality safety depends. The effect of changes in these parameters, or 
in the conditions to which they apply, shall be understood. 
The NCSE shall be documented with sufficient detail, clarity, and lack of ambiguity to allow 
independent judgment of results. 
September 2020 
REGDOC-2.4.3, Nuclear Criticality Safety, Version 1.1 
 
 
77 
 
Before the start of operation, there shall be an independent assessment that confirms the adequacy 
of the NCSE. 
12.6 
Materials control 
The movement of fissionable materials shall be controlled as specified in documented procedures. 
The transport of fissionable materials within the public domain shall comply with appropriate 
national and international regulations [9, 41, 42]. 
Appropriate material labelling and area posting shall be maintained, specifying material 
identification and all limits on parameters that are subject to procedural criticality control. 
If reliance for criticality control is placed on neutron-absorbing materials that are incorporated 
into process materials or equipment, procedural control shall be exercised to maintain their 
continued presence with the intended distributions and concentrations. 
Access to areas where fissionable material is handled, processed, or stored shall be controlled. 
Control of spacing, mass, density, and geometry of fissionable material shall be maintained to 
assure subcriticality under all normal and credible abnormal conditions (note: this requirement is 
not applicable to operations with a small quantity of fissionable materials). 
12.7 
Planned response to nuclear criticality accidents 
Guidance for use of nuclear criticality accident alarm systems may be obtained from section 3, 
Criticality Accident Alarm System. Emergency planning and response are addressed in section 16, 
Nuclear Criticality Accident Emergency Planning and Response. 
Emergency procedures shall be prepared, and shall be approved by management. Organizations 
on- and off-site, that are expected to provide assistance during emergencies, shall be informed of 
conditions that might be encountered. They should be assisted in the preparation of suitable 
emergency response procedures. 
Emergency procedures shall clearly designate evacuation routes. Evacuation should follow the 
quickest and most direct routes practicable. These routes shall be clearly identified and should 
avoid recognized areas of higher risk. 
Personnel assembly stations, outside the areas to be evacuated, shall be designated. Means to 
account for personnel shall be established. 
Personnel in the area to be evacuated shall be trained in evacuation methods and informed of 
evacuation routes and assembly stations. Provision shall be made for the evacuation of transient 
personnel. Drills shall be performed at least annually to maintain familiarity with the emergency 
procedures. Drills shall be announced in advance. 
Arrangements shall be made in advance for the care and treatment of injured and exposed 
persons. The possibility of personnel contamination by radioactive materials shall be considered. 
Planning shall include a program for the immediate identification of exposed individuals and 
should include personnel dosimetry.  
September 2020 
REGDOC-2.4.3, Nuclear Criticality Safety, Version 1.1 
 
 
78 
 
Instrumentation and procedures shall be provided for the determination of the radiation intensity 
at the assembly area and in the evacuated area following a criticality accident. Information should 
be correlated at a central control point. 
Emergency procedures shall address re-entry procedures and the membership of response teams. 
Emergency procedures shall provide for shutting off ventilation to prevent release of fission gases 
outside of affected area. Consideration should be given that shutting off ventilation does not 
generate other safety hazards.

and for moderated (slow neutron) systems. 
The kinetic energy released during the fission burst should be compared to the equivalent energy 
measured in familiar events, for example, chemical explosions. 
A distinction should be made between the intensity of radiation that may appear essentially 
instantaneously, as from a spike yield, and that which may be expected to be associated with a 
continuing fission reaction. This information should be used to estimate the range of exposures 
that may be associated with process accidents.

Use of Fixed Neutron Absorbers in Nuclear Facilities Outside Reactors 
Some parts of this section are extracted from ANSI/ANS-8.21-1995 (reaffirmed in 2019), Use of 
Fixed Neutron Absorbers in Nuclear Facilities Outside Reactors, with permission of the 
publisher, the American Nuclear Society. The text may have been adapted to make it applicable 
to Canada’s international obligations to IAEA and consistent with CNSC’s regulatory 
requirements. 
14.1 
Introduction 
Fixed neutron absorbers (poisons) are frequently used as part of the overall criticality safety 
control measures. 
Section 2, Nuclear Criticality Safety in Operations with Fissionable Materials Outside Reactors, 
covers general considerations of neutron absorbers for criticality prevention. Section 14 (this 
section) supplements guidance provided in section 2 and section 11, Criticality Safety Criteria for 
the Handling, Transportation, Storage, and Long-term Waste Management of Reactor Fuel 
Outside Reactors. Section 4 of this document addresses specific applications of neutron absorbers 
and provides guidance on their use. Section 14 provides additional detailed guidance on the use of 
fixed neutron absorbers in the design, construction, and operation of nuclear facilities outside 
reactors. 
For the purpose of this document, fixed neutron absorbers are materials that: 
1. are an integral part of a facility, equipment, or fuel components 
2. have neutron absorption properties, and 
3. are incorporated into designs to assure margins for subcriticality as needed for normal 
and abnormal conditions 
This guidance applies to the design, construction, and operation of facilities used for handling, 
processing, and storing of fissionable materials. This guidance also applies to equipment 
associated with the transportation of fissionable material. 
Use of fixed neutron absorbers may reduce the need for reliance on administrative criticality 
safety controls. Such use may provide more cost-effective utilization of the facility or equipment 
while maintaining adequate safety margins. When fixed neutron absorbers are present but are not 
required to maintain subcriticality under normal or credible abnormal conditions, this section 
does not apply. 
14.2 
Scope 
This section provides guidance for the use of fixed neutron absorbers as an integral part of 
nuclear facilities and fissionable material process equipment outside reactors, where such 
absorbers provide criticality safety control. 
14.3 
General safety considerations 
The purpose of fixed neutron absorbers in criticality control applications is to assure sub- 
criticality for normal and credible abnormal conditions over the operating life of the facility or 
equipment. The nuclear criticality safety practices of section 2 are applicable. Verification of the 
absorbers and their effectiveness to capture neutrons shall be required before the materials are 
September 2020 
REGDOC-2.4.3, Nuclear Criticality Safety, Version 1.1 
 
 
85 
 
used. After the installation, there shall be verification to ensure that the neutron absorber system 
is in place as intended. The extent and frequency of verification shall be dictated by the impact of 
the environment in which the absorbers are placed on the absorber material properties, and on the 
configuration. 
Establishing the effectiveness of neutron absorbers requires either the use of applicable 
experimental data or the use of analytical methods that have been validated with suitable 
benchmark experiments. The material selection and protection for specific applications must be 
consistent with the neutron absorption requirements for the projected facility operation under both 
normal and credible abnormal conditions. 
If moderator or structural materials are needed for criticality safety in a neutron absorber system, 
these materials are also subject to controls, analyses, and verifications as specified in the 
following sections. 
14.4 
Requirements and guidance 
Requirements for the use of fixed neutron absorbers for criticality safety control are grouped 
under three topics: design, safety evaluations, and verification and inspection. These topics shall 
be considered as part of the implementation and application process during design, construction, 
testing, and operation. 
14.4.1 Design 
Fixed neutron absorbers shall be designed to maintain their required geometrical relationship with 
fissionable materials during the intended operating life. 
A means of verification shall be provided to determine that the design, safety, and operating 
requirements are met for all neutron absorber system components. Requirements for in-service 
verification shall be considered during the design of the neutron absorber system. 
The design shall include assessment of the operating environment. Degradation of the neutron 
absorber or materials used to protect the neutron absorber due to chemical, physical, radiological, 
and mechanical impacts shall be protected against or allowed for in the design process. 
The fixed neutron absorber shall be designed to maintain its designed neutron absorption 
capability during its intended operating life, including all credible conditions of neutron 
moderation and reflection. 
Radiation effects on the neutron absorber system over its expected life (e.g., depletion by neutron 
absorption, embrittlement, and radiolysis) shall be evaluated. 
The design shall make allowances for process material variations, for manufacturing tolerances, 
for uncertainties in the absorber density and distribution, and for uncertainties in the nuclear 
properties (such as the accuracy of neutron cross sections) of the neutron absorber. 
The neutron absorber system shall be designed such that the criticality safety function is not 
compromised under all normal and credible abnormal conditions for the facility or equipment. 
The neutron absorber system shall be designed to prevent inadvertent removal, displacement, or 
alteration of its components. 
September 2020 
REGDOC-2.4.3, Nuclear Criticality Safety, Version 1.1 
 
 
86 
 
The design of equipment and facilities incorporating fixed neutron absorbers shall incorporate 
human factors engineering practices for installation, operation, and maintenance of fixed neutron 
absorbers. 
The requirements of operations, fissionable material accountability, and other safety disciplines 
shall be considered in the design of the neutron absorber system. 
14.4.2 Safety evaluations 
The criticality safety practices of section 2 shall be applied. 
The potential for neutron absorber degradation in the normal operating environment due to 
physical or chemical actions and any material composition changes, and changes in the material 
of the neutron absorber system (for example, cladding), shall be assessed. 
The impact of normal and credible abnormal conditions on the neutron absorber system, such as 
radiation damage, chemical reactions, fire, temperature variations, pressure conditions, vibrations, 
mechanical impacts, abrasion, corrosion, inadvertent removal, depletion, and flooding, shall be 
evaluated. 
Any event that subjects the neutron absorber system to physical or chemical conditions outside 
the design envelope shall require the reassessment of the system prior to restart of operations. 
Safety analyses shall be based on results obtained from validated calculational methods or results 
obtained from applicable experiments. The calculational methods shall be validated in accordance 
with section 2. 
The calculational methods used shall replicate the effect of neutron flux depressions associated 
with localized neutron absorbers. 
The effect on criticality of inhomogeneity (for example, neutron streaming through the neutron 
absorber material) of the fixed neutron absorbers shall be assessed. 
Evaluations shall consider manufacturing tolerances, material substitutions, geometry changes, 
corrosion allowance, modeling assumptions, process variables, and other relevant uncertainties. 
14.4.3 Verification and inspection 
The inspection and verification plan for fixed neutron absorber systems shall conform to the 
licensee’s quality assurance requirements. Any actions as a result of the plan shall not 
compromise the nuclear criticality safety of the operating system. The inspection and verification 
shall be documented, and records shall be maintained for the operating life of the facility and of 
the neutron absorber system. 
The required frequency of inspection and the extent of in-service verification shall be determined. 
Factors that shall be considered include the safety analyses, the environment in which the 
absorbers are placed, and the absorber material properties. 
If required, the in-service verification methods used to measure the properties of the absorber 
may include neutronic techniques, other non-destructive techniques, or chemical testing methods.

87 
 
Testing methods used to verify neutron absorber properties shall be calibrated to material 
standards issued by a national or international standards body such as the U.S. National Institute 
of Standards and Technology. 
The inspection and verification plan shall be implemented for the material acquisition, neutron 
absorber system component manufacturing, installation, operation, and maintenance of the 
neutron absorber system. 
Fixed neutron absorber material verification (elemental or isotopic as appropriate) shall be 
obtained before use. 
The neutron absorber system components shall be verified to conform with design drawings and 
specifications before installation. 
Proper installation of the neutron absorber system shall be verified prior to use. 
The operation of the neutron absorber system and its maintenance shall be verified to conform to 
the safety evaluation requirements. 
Results of in-service verifications shall be evaluated and, if necessary, appropriate corrective 
actions shall be taken.

Nuclear Criticality Safety Based on Limiting and Controlling Moderators 
Some parts of this section are extracted from ANSI/ANS-8.22-1997 (reaffirmed in 2016), 
Nuclear Criticality Safety Based on Limiting and Controlling Moderators, with permission of the 
publisher, the American Nuclear Society. The text may have been adapted to make it applicable 
to Canada’s international obligations to IAEA and consistent with CNSC’s regulatory 
requirements. 
15.1 
Introduction 
For many operations, criticality safety is achieved through the limitation of parameters such as 
geometry, mass, enrichment, and spacing of fissionable materials. The amount of fissionable 
material that can be safely handled, stored, or processed at one time can also depend on the 
credible range of neutron moderation. Optimum moderation, by definition, results in the lowest 
critical mass of fissionable materials, other conditions being unchanged. 
An allowable mass, significantly greater than the allowable mass at optimum moderation, can be 
justified by limitation and control of moderators, i.e., control of moderators within specified 
limits. 
15.2 
Scope 
Section 15 (this section) provides guidance for achieving criticality safety by the limitation and 
control of moderators in the range from no moderation to optimum moderation for fissionable 
materials. This section does not apply to concentration control of fissionable materials. 
Guidance for the prevention of criticality accidents in the handling, storing, processing, and 
transporting of fissionable materials is presented in section 2, Nuclear Criticality Safety in 
Operations with Fissionable Materials Outside Reactors. 
15.3 
Nuclear criticality safety practices 
15.3.1 Administrative practices for limitation and control of moderators 
Written procedures shall include the nuclear criticality safety limits and controls of operation. 
These procedures should address any steps to be taken if a moderator control fails. 
Written procedures shall be provided for monitoring, testing, and maintenance to ensure that the 
limits and controls specified in process evaluations are maintained. 
Written procedures shall be provided for moderator sampling and analysis as required by the 
process evaluation. 
Moderator control areas shall be identified to personnel in accordance with facility specific 
practices. 
Appropriate limits and other means for moderator control shall be posted. 
Moderator control requirements shall be included in the firefighting plans. 
Combustible materials in moderator control areas should be minimized. 
September 2020 
REGDOC-2.4.3, Nuclear Criticality Safety, Version 1.1 
 
 
89 
 
Training in understanding and complying with moderator limits and controls shall be provided to 
appropriate personnel as part of nuclear criticality safety training. Additional guidance can be 
found in section 13, Nuclear Criticality Safety Training. 
Additional guidance for administrative practices can be found in section 12, Administrative 
Practices for Nuclear Criticality Safety. 
15.3.2 Process evaluations for limitation and control of moderators 
The process evaluation shall define the moderator control area. 
The process evaluation shall demonstrate that the operation will be subcritical under both normal 
and credible abnormal conditions, as further specified in section 2.3.2.2. 
The process evaluation shall explicitly identify the limits, controls, and engineered barriers for 
moderator control areas. The limits shall be based on experimental data or derived through the 
use of calculational methods which are validated as required by section 2. 
The process evaluation shall address properties of all materials present that could change the 
moderator content. Examples of properties of interest include hygroscopic, hydric, absorptive, 
adsorptive, and radiolytic natures of materials. 
The process evaluation shall address moderators present in, introduced to, or accumulated in a 
moderator control area, either by design or by accident. Appendix F provides examples of 
moderators in section F.1, Typical Moderating Materials, and examples of sources of moderators 
in section F.2, Potential Sources of Moderators. 
The process evaluation shall address the distribution of the moderators within the fissionable 
material and between discrete fissionable material units. Non-uniform distribution of moderators 
that might occur during mechanical (e.g., mixing), thermal, or chemical processes shall also be 
addressed. 
The process evaluation should address tolerances and changes in the appropriate chemical and 
physical properties of the moderator. 
The process evaluation should address the adequacy and integrity of containers used to transfer 
and store moderators or moderator controlled materials in a moderator control area. 
The process evaluation shall address moderators that might be encountered during maintenance, 
decontamination, construction, and non-operational activities. 
The process evaluation shall address the need for special controls involving fire prevention and 
suppression. The impact of firefighting in adjacent areas should also be considered. 
The process evaluation shall establish the requirements for moderator measurement necessary to 
ensure specified limits and controls are maintained. Appendix F, section F.3, Moderator Content 
Measurements, provides an example of some aspects and considerations to assure integrity of 
moderator content measurement. 
The process evaluation shall address the double contingency principle as stated in section 2.

15.4 
Engineered practices for moderator control areas 
15.4.1 Moderator control area barriers 
Moderator control areas shall be provided with engineered barriers as required by the process 
evaluation. Consideration should be given to potential hazards external to the moderator control 
areas that could compromise the integrity of the engineered barriers. 
15.4.2 Equipment and containers 
Fissionable material processing equipment and containers used in moderator controlled areas 
shall be designed, constructed, and made to limit and control moderators in accordance with the 
process evaluation. Examples of these barriers are provided in appendix F, section F.4, Examples 
of Engineered Barriers to Control Moderators. 
15.4.3 Penetrations 
Penetrations into a moderator control area should be minimized. 
Systems that penetrate a moderator control area and normally contain moderators shall have 
limits and controls as required by the process evaluation. 
Systems (such as ventilation ducts, compressed gas lines, electrical conduits, and drains) that 
penetrate a moderator control area, but do not normally contain moderators, shall have controls as 
required by the process evaluation. 
15.4.4 Fire prevention and suppression 
Fire control in moderator control areas shall incorporate the design features identified by the 
process evaluation. The use of non-moderating fire suppressant media should be considered. 
Preference should be given to the use of non-combustible or fire-resistant building components, 
equipment, and materials to reduce the probability of introducing moderator material in 
firefighting activities. 
Combustible materials should be minimized in moderator control areas to reduce the probability 
of introducing moderator material during firefighting activities. Necessary materials that are 
combustible or not fire resistant should be maintained in a manner to minimize the risk of fire. 
15.4.5 Instrumentation and controls 
Instrumentation and controls may be used to detect or prevent the presence of moderators. 
Instrumentation and controls identified in the process evaluation shall be designed, installed, 
operated, and maintained in accordance with section 2.

Nuclear Criticality Accident Emergency Planning and Response 
Some parts of this section are adopted from ANSI/ANS-8.23-2019, Nuclear Criticality Accident 
Emergency Planning and Response, with permission of the publisher, the American Nuclear 
Society. The text may have been adapted to make it applicable to Canada’s international 
obligations to IAEA and consistent with CNSC’s regulatory requirements. 
16.1 
Introduction 
Nuclear criticality safety programs at facilities that use fissionable material are primarily directed 
at the avoidance of nuclear criticality accidents. However, the possibility of such accidents exists 
and the consequences can be life-threatening. This possibility mandates advance planning 
practice in planned emergency responses and verification of readiness. 
16.2 
Scope 
Section 16 (this section) provides guidance for minimizing risks to personnel during emergency 
response to a nuclear criticality accident outside reactors. Criticality accident emergency planning 
and response procedures shall be maintained in any facility where a criticality accident alarm 
system, as specified in section 3, Criticality Accident Alarm System, is in use. 
The provisions of this section may be considered in emergency planning for nuclear power plant 
sites and research reactor facilities. This section does not apply to off-site accidents, or to off-site 
emergency planning and response. 
16.3 
Responsibilities 
16.3.1 Management responsibilities 
Management shall ensure that: 
 
staff with relevant expertise is provided 
 
an emergency response plan is established, maintained and exercised 
 
immediate evacuation zones and evacuation routes are established 
 
a personnel assembly station (or stations) is established, and a method is provided for 
timely accounting of all personnel who were within the immediate evacuation zone at the 
time of the evacuation 
 
instrumentation and equipment needed to respond to a criticality accident is provided 
 
the level of readiness (including training) needed for response to a criticality accident is 
adequate 
 
the capability to perform radiological dose assessments for response to criticality 
accidents is provided 
 
a communication system for central coordination of all site emergency activities is 
provided 
 
nuclear accident dosimeters, for both personal and fixed units, are provided 
 
equipment such as a criticality accident alarm system (defined in section 3) and 
procedures are in place to activate the emergency response when needed

16.3.2 Technical staff responsibilities 
16.3.2.1 
 
Planning 
The technical staff shall: 
 
identify potential criticality accident locations 
 
evaluate and characterize potential criticality accidents including prediction of 
radiological dose 
 
determine the instrumentation and equipment requirements for emergency response 
activities 
 
define the immediate evacuation zone for each potential criticality accident location 
 
participate in the planning, conduct, and evaluation of exercises and drills 
16.3.2.2 
 
Emergency responses 
During an emergency response the technical staff shall: 
 
be available to advise and assist the emergency coordinator in responding to the 
criticality accident 
 
conduct a radiological dose assessment appropriate for a criticality accident 
16.4 
Emergency response planning 
16.4.1 Evaluation 
If this section applies, as defined in section 16.2, then an evaluation shall be conducted and 
documented to identify potential criticality accident locations. 
The evaluation shall describe the representative nuclear criticality accident. This description may 
be based on professional judgment or a more detailed analysis. The description should include the 
estimated fission yield and estimated likelihood of recurrence of criticality. 
An immediate evacuation zone shall be established based on the documented evaluation. 
Emergency response planning shall establish a maximum acceptable value for the absorbed dose 
at the immediate evacuation zone boundary. The basis for the maximum acceptable value shall be 
documented. Shielding may be considered in establishing the immediate evacuation zone. The 
localized effects of a criticality accident, and the fact that rapid evacuation is not without risk can 
result in an immediate evacuation zone that is significantly smaller than an entire site. 
Note: The representative nuclear criticality accident(s) can be one of the following: 
 
a bounding nuclear criticality accident (as described below)  
 
a less conservative nuclear criticality accident, if detailed analyses of nuclear criticality 
accidents are performed and shown to be applicable to the conditions being evaluated 
The bounding nuclear criticality accident (based on an accident description in the 
U.S.Nuclear Regulatory Commission Regulatory Guide 3.71, Nuclear Criticality Safety 
Standards for Fuels and Material Facilities [44]), is used by CNSC staff to evaluate various 
applications in various facilities. The applicant should assess the description, select and use 
those details that are relevant to the intended application. The assumption is that the radiation 
source strengths and releases from a nuclear criticality accident arise from an excursion 
occurring in an unfavorable geometry containing a solution of 400 g/L of uranium enriched in 
235U. The excursion produces an initial burst of 1 x 1018 fissions in 0.5 seconds, followed 
successively at 10-minute intervals by 47 bursts of 1.9 x 1017 fissions, for a total of

REGDOC-2.4.3, Nuclear Criticality Safety, Version 1.1 
 
 
93 
 
1 x 1019 fissions in 8 hours. The excursion is assumed to be terminated by evaporation of 
100 litres of the solution. 
16.4.2 Emergency response plan 
Based on the above evaluation, an emergency response plan shall be established and maintained. 
The emergency response plan may form an integral part of, or be separate from, other plans. 
The emergency response plan shall include guidance to management, technical staff, and 
response personnel for response to a criticality accident. The plan shall address recommended 
protective actions, functions of response personnel, and equipment needed for criticality accident 
response. 
The emergency response plan shall identify potential criticality accident locations, and includes 
appropriate facility descriptions. 
The emergency response plan shall include provisions for: 
 
providing an emergency coordinator 
 
activating emergency response 
 
responding to concurrent emergencies (for example, fire, personnel injury, security 
incidents) 
 
identifying exposed personnel and determining their radiation dose 
 
providing appropriate medical care for exposed personnel 
 
evaluating the consequences of the criticality accident, including those from radioactive 
and non-radioactive hazardous materials that may be released as a result of the accident 
 
determining when the emergency condition no longer exists 
 
coordinating with emergency organizations expected to provide emergency response 
assistance (these organizations may be onsite or offsite) 
 
assembly and accountability of personnel 
The emergency response plan may be activated if merely a perception exists that a criticality 
accident is developing, is occurring, or has occurred. 
16.4.3 Equipment 
Appropriate protective clothing and equipment shall be provided for response personnel. This 
clothing and equipment may include respiratory protection equipment, anti-contamination suits, 
both high-range and low-range gamma radiation detection equipment, neutron detection 
equipment, communications equipment, and personal monitoring devices (such as self-reading 
pocket dosimeters). 
Appropriate monitoring equipment to determine if further evacuation is needed, and to identify 
exposed individuals, shall be provided for use at personnel assembly station(s). 
16.5 
Evacuation 
16.5.1 Personnel in the immediate evacuation zone 
When an evacuation is initiated, all personnel within the immediate evacuation zone shall 
evacuate without hesitation by planned evacuation routes to an established assembly station (or 
stations). 
September 2020 
REGDOC-2.4.3, Nuclear Criticality Safety, Version 1.1 
 
 
94 
 
16.5.2 Monitoring in adjacent areas 
Radiation levels shall be monitored in occupied areas adjacent to the immediate evacuation zone 
after initiation of the emergency response. 
16.5.3 Monitoring at assembly stations 
Radiation levels shall be monitored periodically at the assembly station (or stations) after 
initiation of the emergency response. 
16.5.4 Further evacuation of non-emergency-response personnel 
If the monitoring required by sections 16.5.2 and 16.5.3, above, indicates that the dose rate 
exceeds 1 mSv/h (100 mrem/h) in areas that continue to be occupied, non-emergency-response 
personnel shall be evacuated from those areas. 
The dose rate of 1 mSv/h was adapted from NCRP Report No. 116 [36]. 
16.5.5 Exits 
Sufficient exits from the immediate evacuation zone shall be provided to enable rapid and 
unobstructed evacuation of personnel. Immediate evacuation for personnel protection shall take 
precedence over contamination control or security considerations. 
16.5.6 Identification of assembly stations 
Assembly stations shall be clearly identified or posted. 
16.5.7 Evacuation route planning 
Evacuation routes should be planned to minimize the total risk considering all potential hazards, 
for example, chemical, industrial, and radiation. 
16.6 
Re-entry, rescue, and stabilization 
All activities associated with re-entry, rescue, and stabilization shall be coordinated and 
authorized by the emergency coordinator. The emergency coordinator may delegate authority to 
other qualified individuals. 
16.6.1 Re-entry 
Re-entry shall be planned to minimize risks to personnel. 
Re-entry during the emergency shall be made only by volunteers trained in emergency response 
and re-entry. 
Re-entry should be made only if a preliminary radiological survey indicates that the radiation 
levels are acceptable for re-entry. Existing instrumentation or temporary sensors with remote 
readout may be used. 
All re-entries shall be made with continuous radiation monitoring. 
If the system remains critical and is possibly causing excessive damage or significant releases of 
radioactive material, an early re-entry effort to disable the system may be permitted. The method 
September 2020 
REGDOC-2.4.3, Nuclear Criticality Safety, Version 1.1 
 
 
95 
 
for disabling the system shall be carefully planned and implemented to minimize hazards to the 
re-entry team. 
16.6.2 Rescue 
If personnel need to be rescued, the rescue shall be planned so as not to expose rescuers to life-
threatening radiation doses. Consideration should be given to the possibility of a continuing or 
recurring criticality. 
Rescue actions that require early re-entry into the immediate evacuation zone should be 
performed by more than one volunteer. 
16.6.3 Stabilization 
The technical staff shall determine if the system is subcritical and shall advise management of 
methods to ensure stabilization of affected equipment and safe conditions for personnel. This may 
include placing the fissile material in a favourable geometry, diluting the fissile solution below a 
critical concentration, or using neutron absorbers to maintain subcriticality. 
If use of neutron absorbers is planned to shut down or stabilize a system, a sufficient quantity of 
absorbers shall be readily available. Prior to being selected for use, the effect of the neutron 
absorbers under accident conditions shall be evaluated. Consideration shall be given to material 
compatibility and to cases under which addition of the neutron absorber can increase system 
neutron multiplication. 
16.7 
Classroom training, exercises, and evacuation drills 
16.7.1 Classroom training 
A program of training for response to a criticality accident shall be developed and provided in 
accordance with section 13, Nuclear Criticality Safety Training. This training shall be reviewed 
annually and as needed, to ensure that changes or modifications are incorporated into the training 
program. Other instructional formats, such as computer based training, may be used to satisfy 
these requirements. 
Facility personnel who must respond to a criticality accident alarm shall be trained to recognize 
the alarm, and to know the layout of the facility, evacuation routes, location of personnel 
assembly stations, and personnel accountability and monitoring methods. 
Emergency response personnel shall be trained on their specific duties and responsibilities to 
respond to a criticality accident. This training shall include procedures, facility layout, and 
characteristics of a criticality accident. 
Visitors shall be briefed on their responsibilities in responding to a criticality accident alarm or 
criticality accident. 
Training on re-entry procedures and facility hazards shall be provided annually for re-entry team 
personnel. 
Technical staff shall be trained in their duties and responsibilities in the event of a criticality 
accident. 
September 2020 
REGDOC-2.4.3, Nuclear Criticality Safety, Version 1.1 
 
 
96 
 
Training should emphasize that emergency actions, including evacuation, should be performed in 
a manner to reduce risk of injury. 
16.7.2 Exercises 
A criticality accident response exercise should be conducted annually to test the capabilities of 
the emergency organizations and communication system and to reinforce emergency training. 
Exercises may include a drill. If exercises are conducted, the following apply: 
 
exercises should include a realistic scenario involving a simulated criticality accident, and 
have defined objectives that specify the aspects of emergency response selected for 
testing or reinforcing 
 
exercises should include a post-exercise critique involving observers, controllers, and 
representative participants 
 
exercises should be planned and controlled by personnel who are not direct participants 
(players) in the exercise 
 
emergency response personnel should participate in nuclear criticality accident exercises 
to update and reinforce their previous response training 
16.7.3 Evacuation drills 
Evacuation drills shall be conducted at least annually. Drills should be scheduled to include all 
personnel who routinely work within the immediate evacuation zone. 
The drills shall be pre-announced (for example, by written notice, posted signs, or public address 
announcement) to minimize the possibility that accident or injury could result. 
If the response tests the same evacuation practices as used for a criticality accident, an evacuation 
drill may involve a scenario other than a criticality accident. A response to a false alarm should 
not be substituted for a drill, unless the required actions are observed or demonstrated.

Appendix A: Normal and Credible Abnormal Conditions 
The determination that a process will be subcritical under normal and credible abnormal conditions 
requires careful study. The criticality accidents that have occurred in industrial operations have resulted 
from failure to anticipate conditions that might arise; none has resulted from a faulty calculation of keff. 
The engineered nuclear criticality safety controls should be designed to withstand the effects of extreme 
loadings and environmental conditions (for example, extremes of temperature, humidity, pressure, or 
radiation) arising from the following initiating conditions and any other conditions having a direct effect 
on nuclear criticality safety [1]: 
1. external postulated initiating events: 
 
natural phenomena 
o extreme weather conditions (precipitation: rain, hail, snow, ice; frazil ice; 
wind: tornadoes, hurricanes, cyclones, dust or sand storm; lightning; high or 
low temperatures; humidity) 
o flooding 
o earthquake and eruption of volcano 
o natural fires 
o effect of terrestrial and aquatic flora and fauna (blockage of inlets and 
outlets, damages on structure) 
 
human induced phenomena 
o fire, explosion or release of corrosive or hazardous substance (from 
surrounding industrial and military installations or transport infrastructure) 
o aircraft crash 
o missiles due to structural or mechanical failure in surrounding installations 
o flooding (failure of a dam, blockage of a river) 
o power supply and potential loss of power 
2. internal postulated events: 
 
loss of energy and fluids (electrical power supplies, air and pressurized air, vacuum, 
superheated water and steam, coolant, chemical reagents, and ventilation) 
 
use of electricity or chemicals 
 
mechanical failure including drop loads, rupture (pressure retaining vessels), leaks 
(corrosion), plugging 
 
instrumentation and control, human failures 
 
internal fires and explosions (gas generation, process hazards) 
 
flooding, vessel overflows 
 
addition of organic solvent to aqueous solution (or vice versa) to cause unexpected 
concentration of fissile components in new solvent 
The following are typical examples of variations in process conditions that should be considered: 
1. a change in intended shape or dimensions resulting from bulging, corrosion, or bursting 
of a container, or failure to meet specifications in fabrication 
2. an increase in the mass of fissionable material in a location as the result of operational 
error, improper labelling, equipment failure, or failure of analytical techniques 
September 2020 
REGDOC-2.4.3, Nuclear Criticality Safety, Version 1.1 
 
 
98 
 
3. a change in the ratio of moderator to fissionable material resulting from: 
 
inaccuracies in instruments or chemical analyses 
 
flooding, spraying, or otherwise supplying units or groups of units with water, oil, 
snow (i.e., low-density water), cardboard, wood, or other moderating material 
 
evaporating or displacing moderator 
 
precipitating fissionable material from solutions 
 
diluting concentrated solutions with additional moderator 
 
introducing air bubbles between rows of fuel assemblies in a storage basin 
4. a change in the fraction of the neutron population lost by absorption resulting from: 
 
loss of solid absorber by corrosion or by leaching 
 
loss of moderator 
 
redistribution of absorber and fissionable material by precipitation of one but not the 
other from a solution 
 
redistribution of solid absorber within a matrix of moderator or solution by clumping 
 
failure to add the intended amount of absorber to a solution or failure to add it with 
the intended distribution 
 
failure of analytical techniques to yield correct amounts of concentrations 
5. a change in the amount of neutron reflection resulting from: 
 
an increase in reflector thickness by adding additional material (e.g., water or 
personnel) 
 
a change in reflector composition such as loss of absorber (e.g., by corrosion of an 
outer casing of absorber) 
6. a change in the interaction between units and reflectors resulting from: 
 
the introduction of additional units or reflectors (e.g., personnel) 
 
improper placing of units 
 
loss of moderator and absorber between units 
 
collapse of a framework used to space units 
7. an increase in the density of fissionable material

Appendix B: Calculation Methods Yielding keff 
This discussion of calculational methods yielding keff illustrates the requirements of section 2.3.4, 
Validation of a calculational method. 
B.1 
Purpose 
The purpose of using calculational methods is to supplement experimental data by interpolation and 
extrapolation. 
B.2 
Background 
Verification is the process of confirming that an installed computer code correctly performs the intended 
numerical calculations. 
A benchmark is a well-characterized experiment at the critical state that may be used to establish the 
reliability of calculational methods. 
Validation is the process of determining the applicability of a computational method and establishing the 
bias of the method by using benchmarks appropriate for intended evaluation of operations. 
B.3 
Establishing the upper subcritical limit 
Where calculational methods of analysis are applied to predict neutron multiplication factors for safety 
assessments, the calculated multiplication factor, kp, for that application, plus its associated uncertainties, 
|∆kp|, shall not exceed an established allowable value (the upper subcritical limit (USL)) for the neutron 
multiplication factor for all normal and credible abnormal conditions as follows: 
kp + |∆kp| ≤ USL 
In these calculations, USL is the result of the validation process and may be expressed as: 
USL = kc - |∆kc| - |∆km| 
where: 
kc 
= 
the mean keff, which results from the calculation of the benchmark criticality 
experiments through the use of a particular calculational method. 
If the calculated multiplication factors for the criticality experiments exhibit a 
trend with a parameter, then kc shall be determined on the basis of a best fit to 
the calculated values. The experiments used as benchmarks in computing kc 
should have material compositions (fissionable materials, neutron absorbers, 
and moderators), geometric configurations, neutron energy spectra, and 
nuclear characteristics (including reflectors) similar to those of the system 
being evaluated. The difference between the experimentally measured value 
of keff and kc is defined as the bias. This bias is expected to be a function of 
composition and other variables and should be examined for trends. 
∆kc 
= 
a margin for kc bias and bias uncertainty, which includes allowance for: 
 
Uncertainties in the critical experiments; 
 
Statistical or convergence uncertainties, or both, in the computation of kc; 
 
Uncertainties due to extrapolation of kc outside the range of experimental 
September 2020 
REGDOC-2.4.3, Nuclear Criticality Safety, Version 1.1 
 
 
100 
 
data; and 
 
Uncertainties due to limitations in the geometrical or material 
representations used in the computational method. 
∆km 
= 
A minimum administrative margin of 50 mk (5%) to ensure the subcriticality 
of USL. 
kp 
= 
the calculated multiplication factor, keff, of the system being evaluated for 
normal and credible abnormal conditions or events. 
∆kp 
= 
an allowance for: 
 
Statistical or convergence uncertainties, or both, in the computation of kp; 
 
Uncertainties due to limitations in the geometric or material 
representations used in the computational method. 
The various uncertainties may be combined statistically if they are independent (an example of this can be 
found in [45]). Correlated uncertainties should be combined additively. 
Methods that do not directly yield keff, but whose validity has been established in accordance with 
section 2, may be used to ensure subcriticality. 
Appropriate experimental data or data derived from experiments, with an allowance adequate to ensure 
subcriticality, may be used directly. 
In situ measurements performed in accordance with section 5, Safety in Conducting Subcritical Neutron 
Multiplication Measurements In Situ, may be used to confirm subcriticality. 
B.4 
Ensuring practicality of compliance; upper subcritical limit 
In practice, statistical or convergence uncertainties, |∆kp|, may be different in each specific calculation 
run. The approach, described in section B3, ensures practicality of compliance with USL, which is an 
approved limit and, hence, cannot be changed in each specific calculation. 
Example 
For all normal and credible abnormal conditions, the following condition is to be demonstrated: 
kp + 2σ ≤ USL 
where kp is the calculated multiplication factor, 2σ is its statistical or convergence uncertainty at 95% 
confidence level, and USL is the established upper subcritical limit. 
If, in the criticality evaluation, σ is shown to be greater than all other combined allowances and 
uncertainties, i.e., if: 
σ > │∆kc│ 
then the following more conservative equation should be used: 
kp + 3σ ≤ 0.95

101 
 
B.5 
Extending area (or areas) of applicability 
The area (or areas) of applicability of a calculational method may be extended beyond the range of 
experimental conditions over which the bias is established by making use of correlated trends in the bias. 
Where the extension is large, the method should be: 
1. subjected to a study of the bias and potentially compensating biases associated with 
individual changes in materials, geometries, or neutron spectra, thus allowing changes 
that can affect the extension to be independently validated 
 
In practice, this can be accomplished in a stepwise approach; that is, benchmarks for the 
validation should be chosen (where possible) such that the selected experiments differ 
from previous experiments by the addition of one new parameter so the effect of only the 
new parameter, on the bias can be observed. 
2. supplemented by alternative calculational methods to provide an independent estimate of 
the bias (or biases) in the extended area (or areas) of applicability 
B.6 
Validation report 
To satisfy the requirements of section 2, section 2.3.4.6 it is recommended to do the following: 
1. state the method that was validated (i.e., computer programs and options used, recipes for 
choosing mesh points (where applicable), the cross section sets, and any numerical 
parameters necessary to describe the input) 
2. describe the analytical models (and inherent biases) used for the development of material 
composition atom densities in the experimental data 
3. provide the basis and state the reliability of the terms that define the prescribed parameter 
limit (or limits), kp, where: 
 
 
 
kp ≤ kc - |∆kc| - |∆km| - |∆kp| 
4. identify and demonstrate the relationship (or relationships) and trend (or trends), if 
present, among the independent and dependent parameter (or parameters) used in the 
validation process for establishing biases, area (or areas) of applicability, and parameter 
limits

Appendix C: Example: Validation of a Calculational Method 
This representative example uses fictional data to illustrate the application of the requirements of 
section 2.3.4, Validation of a calculational method. 
The associated literature contains additional, more complex examples of validations generally meeting 
these requirements; in particular, the parameter limits were calculated by methods meeting these 
requirements. 
C.1 
The problem 
Validate a method for calculating subcritical mass limits for water-reflected solutions of fictitium (Fi) 
ranging in concentration from 2 to 32 g 292Fi/L with no restriction on shape. 
C.2 
The method 
The method selected consists of the XYZ computer code for spherical systems using Smith’s 
approximations as described in NIL-3638 and Jones’ three-group cross section. 
The solution was contained in thin water-reflected spherical shells having nuclear properties differing 
insignificantly from those of water.

Validation 
The XYZ code was operational on the local computer. Sample problems distributed with the code were 
run. A comparison with results obtained from the code author for the sample problems indicated that the 
code was operating correctly for multiregion spherical systems. 
Computations were made for the three experimental points and produced the following results:

103 
 
The calculations were converged to a computational error in keff of +/- 0.0001, which is small compared 
with the experimental error. Within the area of applicability covered by experimental data (2 to 16 g/L), 
the computed value of keff is a nearly linear function of concentration and there appears to be no reason to 
expect deviations from smooth behaviour. The area of applicability, however, must be extended to 
include concentrations as great as 32 g/L. 
Between 2 and 16 g/L, keff as a function of concentration is slightly concave upward (see Figure C-1); 
hence linear extrapolation of the values at 8 and 16 might be expected to give an estimate of keff that is too 
low at 32 g/L. The linearly extrapolated result, shown in Figure C-1, is keff = 0.936. The large 
extrapolation, however, should receive further support. 
Figure C-1: Computed keff as a Function of 292Fi Density for Experimentally Critical Systems 
 
In view of the downward drift of keff with an increase in concentration, a study was made to determine the 
cause. The result of this study was that the epithermal capture cross section of 292Fi appeared to have the 
greatest uncertainty and was the likely cause of the discrepancy. A reduction of 20% in the epithermal 
capture cross section was made. Calculations made with the modified method (epithermal cross sections 
reduced by 20%) yielded:

This modification produced results that appear to minimize the drift with concentration variation and that 
may be expected to produce a keff of approximately 1.01 at 32 g/L. 
September 2020 
REGDOC-2.4.3, Nuclear Criticality Safety, Version 1.1

The following calculations were made at a concentration of 32 g/L:

These calculations show that the reactivity difference or relative bias between the two calculations is: 
Δkeff/keff = -0.068 ± 0.002 
Based on the assumption that the modified method would yield keff = 1.01 for a critical system, it can be 
determined by linear interpolation of the data shown in Table C-4 that the unmodified method should give 
keff = 0.9443 for a critical water-reflected solution containing 32 g when the XYZ code is used with the 
unmodified Jones cross sections. 
The bias for the XYZ code with unmodified Jones cross sections, over the concentration range 2 ≤ ρ ≤ 32, 
is thus estimated to be:

The uncertainty in the bias in the range of 2 to 16 g 292Fi is mainly due to experimental error (some 
uncertainty is associated with interpolation). The uncertainty at 32 g 292Fi also must cover all errors 
introduced by extrapolation. A margin in keff sufficient to compensate for uncertainty in the bias and to 
assure subcriticality was judged to be 0.05 in the 2 to 32 g 292Fi/L range. Any system with keff, computed 
by this method, no greater than 0.95, 0.9264, 0.9196, or 0.8943 for concentrations of 2, 8, 16, and 
32 g 292Fi respectively, is confidently expected to be subcritical.

Appendix D: Detector Placement 
D.1 
Introduction 
This appendix provides general guidance for assessing the adequacy of detector placement. It is not 
intended to be inclusive with respect to all situations likely to be encountered, nor is it intended as a 
substitute for facility-specific analysis. 
Specific examples and discussion in this appendix assume that the minimum accident of concern delivers 
the equivalent of an absorbed dose rate to free air of 0.20 Gy/min at 2 metres from the reacting material. 
However, the techniques are equally applicable for situations where the minimum accident to be detected 
has a different fission yield. 
D.2 
General considerations 
Prior to a discussion on the methods for assessing the adequacy of criticality alarm detector coverage, two 
general topics are addressed: operability characteristics of the detection system, and radiation field 
characterization of criticality accidents. 
D.2.1 
Operability characteristics of the detection system 
To meet the intent of section 3, Criticality Accident Alarm System, it is important to have knowledge of 
the detection system’s characteristics, such as the type of radiation being detected, spectral dependencies, 
dead time, the potential for saturation, and whether the system is based on a rate or an integrated quantity, 
to name some of these characteristics. 
Detector behaviour in response to a rapid transient fission pulse should be understood. For rate detectors, 
the effects of needle or indicator inertia on the actual detector’s response should either be measured or 
estimated, i.e., what fraction of the peak dose does the detector actually indicate [46]. For integrating 
detectors, the signal strength is equivalent to the entire burst quantity, minus any dead time effects, 
provided the integration time is greater than the pulse width. 
D.2.2 
Radiation field characterization of criticality accidents 
Accident detectors detect either gamma rays or neutrons. To estimate properly a detector’s response, it is 
therefore necessary to determine the relative contributions of gamma rays and neutrons to the 0.20 Gy 
(20 rad) total dose. This is necessary even for detector systems with dual detection capability, as the 
attenuation/buildup of each type of particle differs as the particles travel between the accident and 
detector locations. 
In the past, estimates of neutron/gamma (or n/γ) dose ratios were almost exclusively based on data from 
actual accidents or dosimetry experiments. The difficulty with these estimates is that they were based on 
absorbed tissue dose and could, depending on the type of accident, lead to an inaccurate n/γ dose ratio 
estimate in air. 
D.2.2.1 
Moderated assemblies 
An experimental recreation of the accident at Y-12 [47] (a moderated assembly), provides estimates of 
both the n/γ dose ratio and the total fission yield necessary for 0.20 Gy/min total at 2 metres. 
The experiment was operated at a sustained rate of 9.5 × 1012 fissions/second for 42 minutes. This 
produced a neutron tissue dose of 0.48 Gy at 1.8 metres, a point at which the n/γ tissue dose ratio had 
September 2020 
REGDOC-2.4.3, Nuclear Criticality Safety, Version 1.1 
 
 
106 
 
been previously measured as 0.30 from an earlier power run. Thus the total dose at 2 metres was 
approximately:

Despite the fact that this estimate is based on tissue dose, it is still an acceptable estimate of the n/γ dose 
ratio in air and the fission rate for the corresponding minimum accident of concern. This is true because 
the radiation field at 2 metres for moderated assemblies is dominated by gamma rays, and 0.01 Gy tissue 
dose from x-rays is about equal to 0.00877 Gy air from gamma rays (i.e., 1 Gy tissue is approximately 
1 Gy air). 
Computer-based estimates that use tissue and air dose flux conversion factors support this conclusion (see 
Table D-1).

Unmoderated assemblies 
For unmoderated assemblies it is possible to estimate the n/γ dose ratio in air from tissue doses received 
during actual accidents. Two criticality accidents have occurred, under conditions similar to those 
specified, with a metallic, partially reflected 239Pu system. In one such accident [21], a transient of 
3 × 1015 fissions produced an estimated 0.51 Gy neutron and 0.051 Gy gamma ray tissue dose at 
1.8 metres. For a bare metallic 239Pu system, the neutron leakage would be higher, and a n/γ tissue dose 
ratio of 12 is assumed. Therefore, the 0.20 Gy dose in air would consist of 0.185 Gy from neutrons and 
0.015 Gy from gamma rays, and result from:

A comparison of this estimate along with computed dose ratio estimates is shown in Table D-2. The 
computed dose ratio estimates indicate that the 0.20 Gy total in air would consist of 0.146 Gy from 
neutrons and 0.054 Gy from gamma rays, slightly different than the estimate based on tissue dose. In 
contrast to moderated systems, the radiation field at 2 metres from an unmoderated system is dominated 
by neutrons that have significantly different energy deposition properties in air than in tissue.

Summary of n/γ Ratios for Moderated and Unmoderated Systems 
The estimates presented above are for highly-enriched low-concentration solution systems, and highly 
enriched metal systems. Clearly, as the transition from low concentration to metal is made, the n/γ dose 
ratio must also change as does the total number of fissions required, although in the latter case the 
relationship between the two is weakly coupled. These items should be considered by an evaluator along 
with any other effects caused by differences, such as fissionable material type or enrichment, for those 
facilities where such accidents are deemed credible. 
D.3 
Methods 
Determining the adequacy of detector coverage is inherently a complicated process. Several options are 
available to the evaluator, including but not limited to: in situ source testing; simple hand calculations; 
one-dimensional deterministic or Monte Carlo transport computations; and two- or three-dimensional 
deterministic or Monte Carlo transport computations. 
D.3.1 
In situ source testing 
In lieu of, or as a supplement to, computations, a fixed neutron or gamma ray source may be used to 
estimate the adequacy of detector coverage for a facility. This would simply amount to placing a source at 
a hypothetical criticality accident location and observing the detectors’ response. Factors that should be 
considered are: 
1. Source strength. The source should be strong enough to provide an adequate signal, i.e., 
statistically significant, at the detector through the intervening shielding and distance. 
2. Source scaling. A relationship between the source strength and the type of accident under 
investigation must be known. The scaling may be as simple as a constant for a source 
calibrated in Gy/h, or more complicated, as in the case of fission based sources. 
3. Source spectrum. The source must either represent the spectral characteristics of credible 
accidents, or some type of estimated correction should be made to account for spectral 
differences. For example, the gamma rays from a monoenergetic cobalt-60 source 
attenuates differently than the gamma rays from an accident, despite the fact that both 
could produce the same dose rate at 2 metres. 
The advantage of in situ source testing is that it is a physical measurement, relieving the evaluator of the 
need to estimate locations, thicknesses, and compositions of the intervening materials. For some 
situations, however, the source strength required could be so high as to be impractical.

D.3.2 
Simple hand calculations 
For cases in which little or no shielding exists, it may be possible to apply a simple hand calculation to 
estimate the range of a detector. Use of this type of calculation is best illustrated by example. 
Example D-1: A Gamma Ray Rate Meter Detector 
Given: 
1. The system must respond to the minimum accident of concern due to a sustained fission 
reaction in moderated, unreflected fissile material delivering 0.0033 Gy/s. 
2. The system must respond to the minimum accident of concern due to a rapid transient in 
an unreflected fissile system, moderated or unmoderated. A 1 ms minimum duration of 
the rapid transient may be assumed. 
3. The detector is set to trip at a gamma ray dose rate of 0.0005 Gy/h. 
Assumptions: 
1. the n/γ dose ratio in air for a moderated system is 0.11 (see Table D-1), so that at 
2 metres, 0.18 Gy is due to gamma rays and 0.02 Gy is due to neutrons 
2. the n/γ dose ratio in air for an unmoderated system is 2.7 (see Table D-2), so that at 
2 metres, 0.054 Gy is due to gamma rays, and 0.146 Gy is due to neutrons 
3. the indicated detector response (needle movement) to a rapid transient is assumed to be at 
least 1/2500 of the actual peak dose rate 
4. the gamma ray dose rate varies inversely as the square of the distance from the 2 metre 
point 
5. an air transmission factor of 1/3 is assumed at large distances 
Assumptions (4) and (5) are equivalent to decoupling the problem into two parts: transport through a 
vacuum, and a constant attenuation factor of 2/3 to account for absorption in the air.

Clearly, the limiting case in the example above is the sustained reaction. Figure D-1 shows a plot of the 
gamma ray dose rate versus distance for this case as well as the unmoderated rapid transient, as 
determined by this method.

The appeal of this method is its simplicity. However, it is noted that there are items that should be 
considered by an evaluator using this technique. First of all, the validity of the transmission factor of 1/3 
for air should be defended, perhaps with the aid of experimental results or attenuation arguments. 
Secondly, technical justification for ignoring other intervening materials should be provided. 
Note that the preceding example should not serve as the sole technical basis for the adequacy of detector 
placement for any facility. Additional technical justification of the technique and consideration of facility-
specific conditions are warranted. 
D.3.3 
One-dimensional deterministic or Monte Carlo transport computations 
In cases where simple hand calculations are insufficient, more detailed one-dimensional models can be 
constructed through the use of either deterministic or Monte Carlo computer codes. 
The advantage of using a computer code is that spectral effects, absorption, scattering, and distance 
attenuation are all taken into account simultaneously. In addition, the method is not limited by the number 
of intervening materials, although it does require estimates of the amount and composition of those 
materials. Results can be generated that are either generic or detector-specific. 
Generic results are a set of guidelines of allowed distances and shielding (types and amounts) between a 
hypothetical accident location and a detector’s position. These criteria could then be applied to a facility 
floor plan to demonstrate coverage. For detector-specific results, a separate computation can be 
performed for each detector and each hypothetical accident location, with estimates of distance and 
amounts of intervening shielding being scenario-specific.

A one-dimensional example 
In this example, a computer code with an appropriate neutron/gamma ray coupled cross section library 
containing air dose flux conversion factors was used to demonstrate how generic criteria might be 
generated. Figure D-2 shows a geometric representation of the computational model. 
Figure D-2: Example of a One-Dimensional Computational Model 
 
Where: * is the source location;  
 
 
R1 is the distance from the source to the beginning of any intervening material other than 
air in the model (R1>2 metres);  
 
 
Rd is the distance from the source to the detector;  
 
 
Rb is the distance from the source to the boundary of the problem (Rb>Rd); and 
 
 
Tm is the sum of the thicknesses of all the intervening material other than air 
 
In this example: 
1. The source term is equivalent in strength and spectrum to the neutron and gamma ray 
leakage from a 25 g/L Pu (95/5) solution criticality accident scaled to produce 0.20 Gy 
total at 2 metres with no other materials present. 
2. The detector distance, Rd, is set at 50 metres. 
3. The initial boundary for intervening materials, R1, is set at 25 metres. 
4. The problem boundary, Rb, is placed at 150 metres. 
 
(In this type of calculations, it is important to set Rb at a large distance beyond any 
location at which results are desired. Failure to do so may result in underprediction of the 
dose at the detector due to underestimation of “sky shine” effects). 
5. The only type of intervening material considered was concrete.

Usage of these results is specific to the detector type and dynamics of the accident. Two examples of 
application of the results follow. 
Application 1: A thermal neutron fluence detector 
Given: 
1. The system must respond to the minimum accident of concern due to a sustained fission 
reaction in moderated, unreflected fissile material delivering 0.0033 Gy/s. 
2. The system must respond to the minimum accident of concern due to a rapid transient in 
an unreflected fissile system, moderated or unmoderated. A 1 ms minimum duration of 
the rapid transient may be assumed. 
3. The detector is set to trip if 16 counts are received within the cycle time of 1 s. For this 
detector, 16 counts correspond to a thermal neutron fluence of 500 n-cm/cm3.

Given the conditions of this example, it is now possible to generate position criteria to be applied to a 
facility floor plan; for example, “A detector must be within 50 metres of a credible location for the 
minimum accident of concern, with no more than 60 cm of intervening concrete, for the detector to 
respond to the accident by setting off the alarm.” 
Note: This example is for illustrative purposes only. The data of Table D-3 and the sample application 
for a thermal neutron detector system should not be used as a technical basis for the adequacy of detector 
placement at any specific facility. 
Application 2: A gamma ray dose rate meter 
Given: 
1. The system must respond to the minimum accident of concern due to a sustained fission 
reaction in moderated, unreflected fissile material delivering 0.0033 Gy/s. 
2. The system must respond to the minimum accident of concern due to a rapid transient in 
an unreflected fissile system, moderated or unmoderated. A 1 ms minimum duration of 
the rapid transient may be assumed. 
3. The detector is set to trip at a gamma ray dose rate of 0.0005 Gy/h. 
4. The indicated detector response (needle movement) to a rapid transient is assumed to be 
at least 1/2500 of the actual peak dose rate.

Given the conditions of this example, it is clear that a detector 50 metres from the location of the 
minimum accident of concern with 30 cm of intervening concrete would respond to the accident by 
setting off the alarm. With more than 30 cm of concrete, an alarm would not be guaranteed by the results 
shown, and more detailed computations would be required for thicknesses between 30 and 60 cm. 
Note: This example is for illustrative purposes only. The data of Table D-3 and the sample application 
for a gamma ray detector should not be used as a technical basis for the adequacy of detector placement at 
any specific facility. 
D.3.4 
Two- and three-dimensional deterministic or Monte Carlo transport computations 
More detailed facility- and accident-scenario-specific models can be constructed through the use of two- 
or three- dimensional computer codes, if judged to be necessary and cost-effective with respect to other 
September 2020 
REGDOC-2.4.3, Nuclear Criticality Safety, Version 1.1 
 
 
115 
 
options, e.g., adding more detectors. In addition to all of the advantages associated with the one-
dimensional modeling, a three-dimensional model includes contributions from floor, ceiling, and possibly 
sky scatter, as well as a more detailed representation of streaming and scatter from room and corridor 
walls. Two-dimensional models are often adequate for situations where radial symmetry may be assumed. 
In contrast to one-dimensional modeling, however, there are several aspects of two- or three-dimensional 
modeling that should be acknowledged by an evaluator prior to the use of this option. These include, but 
are not necessarily limited to, the following: 
1. The modeling effort is more difficult and therefore more time consuming and error prone. 
2. In the case of Monte Carlo calculations, it may be necessary to make heavy use of 
variance reduction techniques, such as source biasing and regional probability weighting, 
to obtain a sufficiently accurate and timely answer. Such biasing is problem-specific, and 
therefore, separate cases would have to be executed for each detector and accident 
scenario of concern. Furthermore, for results of this type (i.e., location-specific and 
energy-dependent, in which very few of the total sampled population may contribute), it 
is quite possible to obtain completely erroneous results despite low estimated standard 
deviations. Additional measures, such as multiple runs with different random number 
sequences, or more in-depth statistical analysis of the results (e.g., variance of the 
variance), should be performed to reduce this possibility. 
3. In the case of deterministic calculations, the amount and detail of meshing required could 
be computationally prohibitive. Furthermore, any deterministic method relying on a 
discretized angular mesh (without some type of mitigation such as a first-collision 
source) is subject to ray effects that can lead to questionable or incorrect results.

Appendix E: Fuel Unit Handling, Storage, and 
Transportation—Criticality Safety Considerations 
Fuel design parameters, storage array dimensions, fuel handling procedures, and moderation and 
reflection conditions are selected in performing nuclear criticality safety evaluations (NCSEs) to assure 
consideration of the most reactive credible conditions. Section 11, Criticality Safety Criteria for the 
Handling, Transportation, Storage, and Long-term Waste Management of Reactor Fuel Outside Reactors, 
section 11.3, General Safety Criteria, requires that consideration be given to normal and credible 
abnormal conditions and to related uncertainties, including design tolerances, associated with controlled 
parameters. Representative parameters and conditions are listed below. 
E.1 
Fuel rod parameters 
Fuel rod parameters include: 
1. fissile material content, form, density, nuclear properties, and distribution 
2. burnable poison content, density, and distribution 
Caution: The reactivity of irradiated fuel containing burnable poisons may exceed that of 
unirradiated fuel. 
3. fuel rod geometry including cladding material and thickness 
4. other materials within the fuel rod that may affect reactivity 
E.2 
Fuel unit configuration 
Fuel unit configuration considerations include: 
1. number of fuel rods and their location within a fuel unit 
2. dimensions of each fuel unit 
3. other materials or rods that may be present 
E.3 
Array parameters 
Array parameters include: 
1. spacing of fuel units 
2. fixed neutron absorbers between fuel units 
3. materials of construction within the array (nuclear properties, quantities, location, and 
dimensions) 
4. fuel handling during loading and unloading operations 
E.4 
Moderator conditions 
Moderator conditions include: 
1. credible conditions of moderation within and between fuel units; for example: 
 
inclusion of plastic shims or other moderating material (fog, snow, mist, or 
personnel) for dry storage of fuel units 
 
water density and temperature including consideration of void formation by boiling 
for storage of fuel units under water 
 
introduction of heavy water into the irradiated fuel storage bay 
E.5 
Reflector and interaction conditions 
Reflector and interaction conditions include: 
1. reflector composition, configuration and location 
2. interaction with other fissile material

Appendix G:Example of a Partial Description of a Nuclear Criticality Safety 
Program for a Fuel Storage Facility 
G.1 
Template of contents of nuclear criticality safety program 
This example is not a prescribed format and content guide for a nuclear criticality safety program. It 
presents one of a number of acceptable ways to satisfy the information requirements (items 1 and 2 in 
section 12.8.2). The main purposes of this example are: 
 
to identify a list of the sections of this regulatory document that apply to a specific facility 
 
to highlight that a nuclear criticality safety program should contain exact text quoted directly 
from the applicable standards, guidelines, and CNSC requirements 
In this example, the fuel storage facility is assumed to be a new facility; therefore, the example 
encompasses the full spectrum of activities necessary to establish a nuclear criticality safety program, 
including design, analysis, alarm systems, emergency response, training, management responsibilities, 
and administrative practices. For each activity, the example gives a partial list of relevant requirements. 
The complete list is to be created by taking into account the profile of the facility. 
G.2 
Identifying the requirements 
This section presents one acceptable method of satisfying the information requirements (item 1 in 
section 12.8.2). 
Sample text: 
The facility is committed to the following subset of regulatory document REGDOC-2.4.3, Nuclear 
Criticality Safety, as appropriate to the needs of the facility: 
1. Section 2, Nuclear Criticality Safety in Operations with Fissionable Materials Outside 
Reactors 
2. Section 3, Criticality Accident Alarm System 
3. Section 6, Nuclear Criticality Safety in the Storage of Fissile Materials 
4. Section 11, Criticality Safety Criteria for the Handling, Transportation, Storage, and 
Long-term Waste Management of Reactor Fuel Outside Reactors 
5. Section 12, Administrative Practices for Nuclear Criticality Safety 
6. Section 13, Nuclear Criticality Safety Training 
7. Section 16, Nuclear Criticality Accident Emergency Planning and Response 
This subset of regulatory document REGDOC-2.4.3 captures all requirements that are relevant to the 
proposed operations at the facility. Some sections of regulatory document REGDOC-2.4.3 have been 
excluded; for example, those related to the handling of powders or solutions. 
The facility is committed to the following CNSC requirements: 
 
Administrative margin of subcriticality is 50 mk (5%) in keff or, where appropriate, 20% of the 
critical mass 
September 2020 
REGDOC-2.4.3, Nuclear Criticality Safety, Version 1.1 
 
 
122 
 
 
Semi-quantitative method will be used to demonstrate that the margin of subcriticality is not 
violated under normal and credible abnormal conditions (accidents or accident sequences) that 
have frequency of occurrence equal to or more than 10-6 per year 
 
The shielding and confinement system of the facility will be designed and operated such that the 
dose, resulting from exposure to direct radiation and to radionuclides released from the facility 
following a criticality accident, does not violate criteria established by international standards 
(Reference X1, Annex III, Section III-2) and national guidance (Reference X2) as a trigger for a 
temporary public evacuation

Sample procedure for criticality accident sequence assessment 
This section provides an example of criticality accident sequence assessment (CASA). It employs a semi-
quantitative risk index method for assessing accident sequences in terms of their likelihood of occurrence. 
The risk index method framework enables the applicant to identify which accidents or accident sequences 
exceed the likelihood level identified in section 2.3.2.2 and, therefore, require designation of criticality 
safety controls (CSC) (i.e., engineered and/or administrative CSC) and supporting management measures. 
Descriptions of these accident sequences need to be reported in the Safety Analysis Report (SAR). 
This section works through an example of how the Risk Index Method can be applied to a uranium 
powder blender. It describes one method of evaluating compliance with the likelihood level identified in 
section 2.3.2.2. The method is intended to permit quantitative information to be considered, if available. 
Since likelihoods are inherently quantitative, evaluation of a particular accident should be consistent with 
any facts available, which may include quantitative information concerning the availability and reliability 
of CSC involved. 
This section presents one method of analysis of credible accident sequences for either the nuclear 
criticality safety evaluation (NCSE) or the SAR. The method of this section describes semi-quantitative 
criteria for evaluating frequency indexes of criticality safety controls. These criteria for assigning indexes, 
particularly the descriptive criteria provided in some tables of this section, are intended to be examples, 
not universal criteria. 
It is preferable that each applicant develops such criteria, based on the particular types of CSC and 
management measure programs. The applicant should modify and improve such criteria as insights are 
gained during performance of the CASA. 
If the applicant evaluates accidents using a different method, the method should produce similar results in 
terms of the accident’s likelihood. The method should be regarded as a screening method, not as a 
September 2020 
REGDOC-2.4.3, Nuclear Criticality Safety, Version 1.1 
 
 
123 
 
definitive method of proving the adequacy or inadequacy of the CSC for any particular accident. Because 
methods can rarely be universally valid, individual accidents for which this method does not appear 
applicable may be justified by an evaluation using other methods. The method does have the benefit that 
it evaluates, in a consistent manner, the characteristics of CSC used to limit accident sequences. This 
method permits identification of accident sequences with defects in the combination of CSC used. Such 
CSC can then be further evaluated or improved to establish adequacy. The procedure also ensures the 
consistent evaluation of similar CSC by different CASA teams. Sequences or CSC that have risk 
significance and are evaluated as marginally acceptable are good candidates for more detailed evaluation 
by the applicant and the reviewer. 
The tabular accident summary resulting from the CASA should identify, for each sequence, what 
engineered or administrative CSC must fail to allow the likelihood that exceeds the levels identified in 
section 2.3.2.2. These requirements state that sequences of events leading to credible abnormal conditions 
shall be evaluated. The likelihood and possible consequences of such occurrences should be evaluated 
using reliable data and methodologies. The purpose of this section is to provide an example of an 
acceptable semi-quantitative method to perform such an evaluation. 
The accident evaluation method described below does not preclude the need to comply with the double-
contingency principle. Although exceptions are permitted with compensatory measures, double 
contingency protection should, in general, be applied. Double contingency protection is needed as there 
are usually insufficient firm data on the reliability of the CSC equipment and administrative CSC 
procedures used in criticality safety. If only one CSC were relied on to prevent a criticality, and it proved 
to be less reliable than expected, then the first time it failed, a criticality accident could result. For this 
reason, at least two independent CSC should be used. Inadequate CSC can then be determined by 
observing their failures without also suffering the consequences of a criticality accident. Even with double 
contingency protection, each CSC should be sufficiently unlikely to fail, so that if one of the two items 
that establish double contingency protection is actually ineffective, criticality is still extremely unlikely. 
G.3.1 
Assessing the effectiveness of the CSC 
The risk of an accident sequence is reduced through the application of different numbers and types of 
CSC. By either reducing the likelihood of occurrence or by mitigating the consequences, CSC can reduce 
the overall resulting risk. The designation of CSC should generally be made to reduce the likelihood (i.e., 
prevent an accident), but the consequences may also be reduced by minimizing the potential hazards (i.e., 
mitigate the consequences) if practical. Based on hazards identification and accident sequence analyses 
for which the resulting unmitigated or uncontrolled risks are unacceptable, administrative and/or 
engineered CSC may be designated to reduce the likelihood of occurrence and/or mitigate severity of the 
consequences. 
G.3.2 
Risk score evaluation summary 
As previously mentioned, an acceptable way for the applicant to present the results of the CASA is a 
tabular summary of the identified accident sequences. Table G-1 is an acceptable format for such a table. 
This table lists several example accident sequences for a powder blender at a typical facility. 
Table G-1 summarizes two sets of information: (i) the accident sequences identified in the CASA; and 
(ii) a likelihood index, calculated for each sequence, to show compliance. The likelihood index 
calculation is summarized below. 
Accident sequences result from initiating events, followed by failure of one or more CSC. Thus, in 
Table G-1, there are columns for the initiating event and for CSC. CSC may be mitigative or preventive. 
Mitigative CSCs are measures that reduce the consequences of an accident. The phrase “uncontrolled 
September 2020 
REGDOC-2.4.3, Nuclear Criticality Safety, Version 1.1 
 
 
124 
 
and/or unmitigated consequences” describes the results when the system of preventive CSC fails and 
mitigation also fails. Mitigated consequences result when the preventive CSC fail, but mitigative 
measures succeed. These are abbreviated in the table as “unmit.” and “mitig.”, respectively. Index 
numbers are assigned to initiating events, CSC failure events, and mitigation failure events, based on the 
reliability characteristics of these items. 
With redundant CSC and in certain other cases, there are sequences in which an initiating event places the 
system in a vulnerable state. While the system is in this vulnerable state, a CSC must fail for the accident 
to result. Thus, the frequency of the accident depends on the frequency of the first event, the duration of 
vulnerability, and the frequency of the second CSC failure. For this reason, the duration of the vulnerable 
state should be considered, and a duration index assigned. The values of all index numbers for a sequence, 
depending on the number of events involved, are added to obtain a total likelihood index, T. 
Note that, if all the failures in the accident sequence are independent, then summation of all index 
numbers is a valid approach for calculation of T. The following discussions and the example in the 
Table G-1 assume that the initiating event and all the CSC failures in the accident sequence are 
independent. However, if the independence is not demonstrated, then the dependent failures should be 
identified and accounted for. Examples of potential dependences are: common cause initiating events, 
intersystem dependences (such as functional dependences, shared-equipment dependences, physical 
dependences, and human-interaction dependences), and inter-component dependences. 
The values of index numbers in accident sequences are assigned considering the criteria in Tables G-2 
through G-4. Each table applies to a different type of event. Table G-1 applies to events that have 
frequencies of occurrence, such as initiating events and certain CSC failures. When failure probabilities 
are required for an event, Table G-3 provides the index values. Table G-4 provides index numbers for 
durations of failure. These are used in certain accident sequences where two CSCs must simultaneously 
be in a failed state. In this case, one of the two controlled parameters will fail first. It is then necessary to 
consider the duration that the system remains vulnerable to failure of the second. This period of 
vulnerability can be terminated in several ways. The first failure may be “fail-safe” or be continuously 
monitored, thus alerting the operator when it fails so that the system may be quickly placed in a safe state. 
Or, the CSC may be subject to periodic surveillance tests for hidden failures. 
When hidden failures are possible, these surveillance intervals limit the duration that the system is in a 
vulnerable state. The reverse sequences, where the second CSC fails first, should be considered as a 
separate accident sequence. This is necessary because the failure frequency and the duration of outage of 
the first and the second CSC may differ. The values of these duration indexes are not judgmental; they are 
directly related to the time intervals used for surveillance and the time needed to render the system safe. 
As shown in Table G-4, the duration of failure is accounted for in establishing the overall likelihood that 
an accident sequence will continue to the defined consequence. Thus, the time to discover and repair the 
failure is accounted for in establishing the risk of the postulated accident. 
When the number is more negative, the failure is less likely; this applies to all of the index numbers. 
Accident sequences may consist of varying numbers of events, starting with an initiating event. The total 
likelihood index is the sum of the indexes for all the events in the sequence, including those for duration. 
As shown in the first row of Table G-1, the failure duration index can make a large contribution to the 
total likelihood index. The reviewer should verify that there is adequate justification that the failure will 
be corrected in the time ascribed to the duration index. In general, duration indexes with values less than 
minus one (-1), corresponding to 36 days, should be based on intentional monitoring of the process. The 
duration of failure for an unmonitored process should be conservatively estimated.

REGDOC-2.4.3, Nuclear Criticality Safety, Version 1.1 
 
 
125 
 
Table G-1 provides two likelihood indexes for each accident sequence to permit evaluation of the risk 
significance of the CSC involved. To measure whether a CSC has high risk significance, the table 
provides an “uncontrolled index”, determined by modeling the sequence with all CSC as failed (i.e., not 
contributing to a lower likelihood). In addition, a “controlled index” is also calculated, taking credit for 
the low likelihood and duration of CSC failures. When an accident sequence has an uncontrolled 
likelihood index exceeding (-2) but a controlled index of less than (-6), the CSCs involved have a high 
risk significance because they are relied on to achieve acceptable safety performance. In addition, use of 
two likelihood indexes allows demonstrating that no CSC has an exceedingly large contribution to risk. 
Thus, use of these indexes permits evaluation of the possible benefit of improving CSC and also whether 
a relaxation may be acceptable. 
Table G-5 provides a more detailed description of the accident sequences used in the example of 
Table G-1. The reviewer needs the information in Table G-5 to understand the nature of the accident 
sequences listed in Table G-1. Table G-1 lacks room to explain any but the simplest failure events. 
Table G-6 explains the CSC and external initiating events that appear in the accident sequences in 
Table G-1. The reviewer needs the information in Table G-6 to understand why the initiating events and 
CSC listed in Table G-1 have the low likelihood indexes assigned. Thus, Table G-6 should contain such 
information as (i) the margins to safety limits, (ii) the redundancy of a CSC, and (iii) the measures taken 
to ensure adequate reliability of a CSC. Table G-6 must also justify why external events, which are not 
obviously extremely unlikely, have the low likelihoods that are being relied on for safety. The applicant 
should provide separate tables to list the CSC for criticality, chemical, fire, radiological, and 
environmental accidents. If an applicant chooses to classify CSC by applying different levels or grades of 
quality assurance, then the applicant should also provide the appropriate quality assurance grade for the 
CSC. 
G.3.3 
Accident summary and likelihood index assignment for Table G-1 
For each column in Table G-1, the following text provides the complete definition: 
Accident sequence / identifier 
This column identifies the accident sequence being analyzed. The CASA has all accident sequences for 
uniquely identified facility processes, referred to here as “nodes”. Symbols, names, or numbers of these 
nodes permit them to be uniquely identified. For example, the “blender hopper” node described in 
Table G-1 has the unique identifying symbol PPB2. PPB2-1 is the first accident sequence identified in 
that node. By reviewing sample accident sequences presented in the SAR and the selected accident 
sequences contained in the NCSE, the reviewer(s) can evaluate and confirm i) the adequacy of the CSC 
for preventing accidents, and ii) the bases for assigning the consequences and likelihoods in the table. 
Initiating event (a1) and enabling event (a2) (if applicable) 
These columns list initiating events or CSC failures that are typically identified in the Process Hazard 
Analysis phase of the NCSE and that may lead to exceeding the levels identified in section 2.3.2.2. 
Initiating events are of several distinct types: i) external events, such as hurricanes and earthquakes; 
ii) facility events external to the node being analyzed (e.g., fires, explosions, failures of other equipment, 
flooding from facility water sources); iii) deviations from normal operations of the process in the node; 
and iv) failures of CSC of the node. The tabulated initiating events should only consist of those that 
involve an actual or threatened failure of CSC or that cause a demand requiring CSC to function to 
prevent exceeding USL. 
September 2020 
REGDOC-2.4.3, Nuclear Criticality Safety, Version 1.1 
 
 
126 
 
The frequency index number for initiating events is referred to in the table by the symbol “frqi.” 
Table G-2 provides criteria for assigning a value to frqi. Usually, there is insufficient room in a tabular 
presentation like Table G-1 to describe events accurately. Consequently, the applicant should provide 
supplementary narrative information to adequately describe each general type of accident sequence in 
Table G-1. Cross-referencing between this information and the table should be adequate (e.g., the unique 
symbolic accident sequence identifiers can be used). Table G-5 is an example of a list of supplementary 
accident sequence descriptions corresponding to Table G-1. 
Preventive safety parameter 1 or CSC 1 failure/success (b) 
This column addresses the failure or success of the safety parameter designated to prevent exceeding 
USL. Specific CSCs that may be needed to maintain the safety parameter should be included in this table. 
If separate parameters or CSCs are used to prevent different consequences, separate rows in the table 
should be defined corresponding to each type of consequence. 
Table G-1 contains an example of a set of related sequences so separated. Accident sequences where two 
CSCs must simultaneously be in a failed state require assignment of three index numbers: i) the failure 
frequency of the first CSC, frq1; ii) the duration of this failure, dur1; and iii) the failure frequency of the 
second CSC, frq2. For such accident sequences, the initiating event is failure of the first CSC. In these 
cases, frq1 is assigned using Table G-2. The failure duration of the first CSC is assigned using Table G-4. 
Other accident sequences may be more easily described as a failure of the CSC on demand after the 
occurrence of an initiating event. In these cases, the failure probability index number, prf1, is assigned 
using Table G-3. 
Preventive safety parameter 2 or CSC 2 failure/success (c) 
This column is provided in case a second preventive CSC is designated. The failure frequency or failure 
probability on demand is assigned in the same manner as for preventive CSC 1. 
Preventive safety parameters or CSC failure/success (d1, d2…) 
This column is provided in case other preventive CSC is designated. The failure frequency or failure 
probability on demand is assigned in the same manner as for preventive CSC 1. 
Likelihood index / risk score* T uncontrolled/ controlled (e) 
This column lists the total likelihood index / risk score for an accident sequence. The total likelihood 
index, T, is the sum of the indices for those events that comprise an accident sequence which normally 
consists of the initiating event and failure of one or more CSC, including any failure duration indices. 
However, accident sequences may consist of varying numbers and types of undesired events. Methods for 
deciding what frequencies and failure durations need to be considered are described later in this appendix. 
Determination of the likelihood index for an accident sequence as the sum of the indices is valid if all the 
failures in the accident sequence are independent. 
Consequence evaluation reference 
This column permits identification of the consequence calculations that relate to this accident sequence. 
Multiple references may be required to refer to calculations of the different types of consequences (e.g., 
radiological, chemical, etc.).

REGDOC-2.4.3, Nuclear Criticality Safety, Version 1.1 
 
 
127 
 
Comments and recommendations 
This column records NCSE team recommendations. It is especially useful when the existing system of 
CSC is evaluated as being deficient. This may happen because a newly identified accident sequence is not 
addressed by existing CSC or because an unacceptable performance deficiency has been found in the 
existing CSC. 
G.3.4 
Determination of failure frequency index numbers in Table G-2 
Table G-2 is used to assign frequency index numbers to plant initiating events and CSC failures as found 
in the columns of Table G-1. The term “failure” must be understood to mean not merely failure of the 
CSC but also a violation of the process safety. In the example in Table G-1, accident sequence PPB2 1A 
involves loss of mass control over uranium dioxide (UO2) in a blender. 
Table G-2 provides two columns with two sets of criteria for assigning an index value, one based on type 
of CSC, the other on observed failure frequencies. Since CSC of a given type have a wide range of failure 
frequencies, assignment of index values based on this table should be done with caution. Due 
consideration should be given to whether the CSC will actually achieve the corresponding failure 
frequency in the next column. 
Based on operational experience, more refined criteria for judging failure frequencies may be developed 
by each applicant. In the column labelled “Based on Type of CSC”, references to redundancy allow for 
CSCs that may themselves have internal redundancy to achieve a necessary level of reliability. 
Another objective basis for assignment of an index value is actual observations of failure events. These 
actual events may have occurred in the applicant’s facility or in a comparable process elsewhere. 
Justification for specific assignments should be noted in the Comments column of Table G-1. 
Note that indices less than (more negative than) -1 should not be assigned to CSC unless the configuration 
management, auditing, and other required management measures are of high quality, because, without 
these measures, the CSC may be changed or inadequately maintained. The reviewer should be able to 
determine this from the tabular summary of CSCs provided in the application. This summary should 
identify the process parameters to be controlled and their safety limits and include a thorough description 
of the CSC and the applied management measures. 
G.3.5 
Determination of failure probability index numbers in Table G-3 
Occasionally, information concerning the reliability of a CSC may be available as a probability on 
demand. That is, there may be a history of tests or incidents where the system in question is demanded to 
function. To quantify such accident sequences, the demand frequency, the initiating event, and the 
demand failure probability of the CSC must be known. Table G-3 provides an assignment of index 
numbers for such CSC in a way that is consistent with Table G-2. The probability of failure on demand 
may be the likelihood that it is in a failed state when demanded (availability) or that it fails to remain 
functional for a sufficient time to complete its function. Justification for specific assignments should be 
noted in the Comments column of Table G-1. 
G.3.6 
Determining management measures for CSC 
Table G-6 is an acceptable way of listing CSCs in all the general types of accident sequences leading to 
exceeding the approved USL. The items listed should include all CSCs and all external events whose low 
likelihood of occurrence is relied upon to meet the likelihood level identified in section 2.3.2.2. 
September 2020 
REGDOC-2.4.3, Nuclear Criticality Safety, Version 1.1 
 
 
128 
 
The reviewer(s) examine this list to determine whether adequate management measures have been applied 
to each CSC to ensure its continual availability and reliability. The types of management measures are 
maintenance, training, configuration management, audits and assessments, quality assurance, etc. Every 
CSC in uncontrolled accident sequences leading to exceeding the likelihood levels identified in 
section 2.3.2.2 should be assigned at least a minimal set of management measures. Specifically, to defend 
against common mode failure of all CSCs on a process, this minimal set of measures must include: 
i) adequate configuration management, ii) regular auditing for the continued effectiveness of the CSC, 
iii) adequate labelling, training, or written procedures to ensure that the operating staff is aware of the 
safety function, iv) adequate surveillance and corrective maintenance, and v) adequate preventive 
maintenance. 
If lesser or graded management measures are applied to some CSCs, Tables G-1 and G-6 and the 
narratives associated with them must identify to which CSC these lesser measures are applied. In 
addition, information indicating that acceptable reliability can be achieved with these lesser measures 
must be presented. The specifics of how each management measure, such as the surveillance interval, 
type of maintenance, or type of testing, is applied to each CSC need not be provided; it is recognized that 
such specific measures must be applied differently to each CSC to achieve adequate reliability.  The 
formality, documentation, and quality assurance requirements applied to these direct management 
measures that may be graded generically in a risk-informed manner must be documented. 
The following paragraphs describe the application of management measures to CSCs based on the risk 
importance of the item in an accident sequence, as defined by the uncontrolled likelihood index shown in 
Table G-1. 
For a particular accident sequence that would have high uncontrolled likelihood index, CSCs should 
reduce the risk from initially high risk (an uncontrolled index of -2 or more from Table G-1) to an 
acceptable risk (controlled index of -6 or less). 
Some accidents could have a relatively high uncontrolled likelihood. Further, for accident sequences 
resulting in nuclear criticality, double contingency should be achieved, thus requiring at least one more 
CSC and an initiating event of low probability. The uncertainty in determining low failure likelihood 
requires compensatory measures in the form of increased assurances (high-level criteria) that the CSC is 
indeed kept at low failure likelihood. 
G.3.7 
Risk-informed review of CSC 
Column (e) in Table G-1 gives the likelihood indices / risk scores for each accident sequence that was 
identified in the CASA. There are two indices, uncontrolled and controlled. The uncontrolled index is a 
measure of risk without credit for the CSC. If the uncontrolled index is a value of -2 or more, while the 
controlled index is an acceptable value (-6 or less), the set of CSC involved are significant in achieving 
acceptable risk. That is, these CSCs have high risk significance. The uncontrolled likelihood index will be 
used by the reviewer(s) to identify all risk-significant systems of CSCs. These systems of CSCs will be 
reviewed more closely.

Table G-5: Accident sequence descriptions 
Process: uranium dioxide (UO2) powder preparation (PP); Unit: additive blending; 
Node: blender hopper node (PPB2) 
Accident 
(see Table G-1) 
Description 
PPB2-1A Blender 
UO2 leak criticality 
The initial failure is a blender leak of UO2 that results in a mass sufficient for criticality on 
the floor (this event is not a small leak). 
Before the UO2 can be removed, moderator sufficient to cause criticality is introduced. 
Duration of critical mass UO2 on floor estimated to be 1 hour. 
PPB2-1B Blender 
UO2 leak, rad. 
Release 
The initial failure is a blender leak of UO2 that results in a mass insufficient for criticality 
on the floor or a mass sufficient for criticality but moderation failure does not occur. 
Consequences are radiological, not a criticality. A ventilated enclosure should mitigate the 
radiological release of UO2. 
If the ventilated enclosure fails during cleanup or is not working, unmitigated consequences 
occur. 
PPB2-1C 
The events of PPB2-1A occur in reverse sequence—the initial failure is introduction of 
water onto the floor under the blender. 
Duration of this flooded condition is 8 hours. During this time, the blender leaks a critical 
mass of UO2 onto the floor. Criticality occurs. 
PPB2-2 
Initiating event is a fire in the blender room. Fire is not extinguished quickly, and UO2 is 
released from process equipment. Offsite dose estimated to exceed 1 mSv (100 mrem).

Note: In addition to engineered CSC, Table G-6 should include descriptions of external initiating events 
of which the low likelihood is relied on to achieve acceptable risk, especially those which are 
assigned frequency indices lower than (-4). The descriptions of these initiating events should 
contain information supporting the frequency index value selected by the applicant.
