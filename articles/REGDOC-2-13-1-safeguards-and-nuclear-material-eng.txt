Preface 
This regulatory document is part of the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission’s (CNSC) Safeguards and 
non-proliferation series of regulatory documents. The full list of regulatory document series is included at 
the end of this document and can also be found on the CNSC’s website. 
Regulatory document REGDOC-2.13.1, Safeguards and Nuclear Material Accountancy, sets out 
requirements and guidance for safeguards programs for applicants and licensees who possess nuclear 
material, operate a uranium and/or thorium mine, carry out specified types of nuclear fuel-cycle related 
research and development work, and/or carry out specified types of nuclear-related manufacturing 
activities. The requirements and guidance in this document are essential to Canadian compliance with the 
safeguards agreements entered into with the International Atomic Energy Agency, and are consistent with 
modern national and international practices. 
This document supersedes RD-336, Accounting and Reporting of Nuclear Material, and GD-336, 
Guidance for Accounting and Reporting of Nuclear Material, which were both published in June, 2010. 
REGDOC-2.13.1 is intended to form part of the licensing basis for a regulated facility or activity within 
the scope of the document. It is intended for inclusion in licences as either part of the conditions and 
safety and control measures in a licence, or as part of the safety and control measures to be described in a 
licence application and the documents needed to support that application. 
For new applicants: This document will be used to assess new licence applications. 
Guidance contained in this document exists to inform the applicant, to elaborate further on requirements 
or to provide direction to licensees and applicants on how to meet requirements. It also provides more 
information about how CNSC staff evaluate specific problems or data during their review of licence 
applications. Licensees are expected to review and consider guidance; should they choose not to follow it, 
they should explain how their chosen alternate approach meets regulatory requirements.  
For existing licensees: The requirements contained in this document do not apply unless they have been 
included, in whole or in part, in the licence or licensing basis.  
A graded approach, commensurate with risk, may be defined and used when applying the requirements 
and guidance contained in this regulatory document. The use of a graded approach is not a relaxation of 
requirements. With a graded approach, the application of requirements is commensurate with the risks 
and particular characteristics of the facility or activity. 
An applicant or licensee may put forward a case to demonstrate that the intent of a requirement is 
addressed by other means and demonstrated with supportable evidence. 
 
Important note: Where referenced in a licence either directly or indirectly (such as through licensee-
referenced documents), this document is part of the licensing basis for a regulated facility or activity.  
The licensing basis sets the boundary conditions for acceptable performance at a regulated facility or 
activity, and establishes the basis for the CNSC’s compliance program for that regulated facility or 
activity.  
Where this document is part of the licensing basis, the word “shall” is used to express a requirement to 
be satisfied by the licensee or licence applicant. “Should” is used to express guidance or that which is

advised. “May” is used to express an option or that which is advised or permissible within the limits of 
this regulatory document. “Can” is used to express possibility or capability. 
Nothing contained in this document is to be construed as relieving any licensee from any other 
pertinent requirements. It is the licensee’s responsibility to identify and comply with all applicable 
regulations and licence conditions.

Safeguards and Nuclear Material Accountancy 
1. 
Introduction 
The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) [1] is the cornerstone of the 
global nuclear non-proliferation regime. States that are party to the NPT have commitments and 
obligations in the areas of non-proliferation, disarmament, and the peaceful use of nuclear 
material and technology.  
To fulfil commitments made under the NPT, Canada has concluded binding safeguards 
agreements with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which provide for the 
application of IAEA safeguards in Canada. Under the safeguards agreements, Canada has an 
obligation to report to the IAEA on all nuclear material and on certain types of nuclear research 
and manufacturing in Canada, and to accept IAEA inspections of those areas. In turn, the IAEA 
has an obligation to ensure that safeguards are applied to all nuclear material in Canada, for the 
purpose of verifying that such material is not diverted to non-peaceful uses.  
Under the Nuclear Safety and Control Act (NSCA), the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission 
(CNSC) has the mandate to achieve Canadian conformity with these agreements. To do so, the 
CNSC imposes obligations on its licensees for reporting required by the IAEA and for the access 
necessary for IAEA verification of this reporting. 
1.1 
Purpose 
REGDOC-2.13.1, Safeguards and Nuclear Material Accountancy, sets out CNSC requirements 
and guidance for the establishment and maintenance of a safeguards program. 
1.2 
Scope 
This document specifies the information, access and support that licensees shall provide to the 
CNSC and the IAEA to facilitate Canadian compliance with Canada’s safeguards agreements 
with the IAEA, and with licensee obligations established in the General Nuclear Safety and 
Control Regulations (GNSCR).  
The term “safeguards” refers to an international system of monitoring and verifying nuclear 
material and specified nuclear activities, administered in Canada by the CNSC and verified by the 
IAEA, to deter the diversion of nuclear material from legitimate peaceful activities. The NPT 
requires that IAEA safeguards apply to nuclear material, in any quantity, wherever it is present in 
Canada. 
REGDOC-2.13.1, Safeguards and Nuclear Material Accountancy, provides safeguards 
requirements and guidance for licensees who:  
a) possess nuclear material, which is defined as: plutonium-239, uranium-233, uranium 
enriched in the isotopes of 235 or 233, uranium containing the mixture of isotopes occurring 
in nature, uranium depleted in the isotope 235, and thorium, and/or  
b) operate a uranium and/or thorium mine, and/or 
c) carry out nuclear-related manufacturing activities as specified in Appendix A: List of 
Declarable Nuclear-Related Manufacturing Activities, and/or 
d) engage in nuclear fuel cycle-related research and development activities as defined in 
Appendix B: List of Nuclear Fuel Cycle-Related Research and Development Activities  
February 2018

The following materials are not subject to this document’s requirements: 
a) uranium or thorium which occurs naturally in rock or soil, including uranium and thorium 
ore 
b) nuclear material in transit through Canada 
c) uranium, plutonium-239 and thorium that is in a non-nuclear end use form, from which the 
CNSC has determined that the uranium, plutonium-239 and thorium is practicably 
irrecoverable 
Additional guidance on materials not subject to safeguards is provided in Appendix C: Guidance 
on Materials Not Subject to Safeguards.  
1.3 
Relevant legislation and obligations 
1.3.1 
Legislation and regulations 
The following provisions of the NSCA and the regulations made under it are relevant to this 
document:  
 
Subparagraph 9(a)(iii) of the NSCA establishes that one of the objects of the Commission 
is to “achieve conformity with measures of control and international obligations to which 
Canada has agreed”.  
 
Paragraph 24(4)(b) of the NSCA states that “[n]o licence shall be issued, renewed, 
amended or replaced — and no authorization to transfer one given — unless, in the 
opinion of the Commission, the applicant or, in the case of an application for an 
authorization to transfer the licence, the transferee…will, in carrying on that activity, 
make adequate provision for the protection of the environment, the health and safety of 
persons and the maintenance of national security and measures required to implement 
international obligations to which Canada has agreed”. 
 
Paragraph 27(b) of the NSCA states that “[e]very licensee and every prescribed person 
shall (b) make the prescribed reports and file them in the prescribed manner”. 
 
Paragraph 12(1)(i) of the GNSCR states that “[e]very licensee shall…take all necessary 
measures to facilitate Canada’s compliance with any applicable safeguards agreement”. 
 
Section 30 of the GNSCR identifies situations in which safeguards reports shall be 
provided by licensees to the Commission. Regulatory document series 3.1, Reporting 
Requirements, sets out the CNSC’s requirements for event and compliance monitoring 
reporting by licensees.  
1.3.2 
International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards agreements 
The IAEA implements safeguards through legally binding treaty-level agreements with states and 
regional authorities. The Agreement Between the Government of Canada and the International 
Atomic Energy Agency for the Application of Safeguards in Connection with the Treaty on the 
Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (Safeguards Agreement) [2] came into force on February 
21, 1972 and the Protocol Additional to the Agreement Between Canada and the International 
Atomic Energy Agency for the Application of Safeguards in Connection with the Treaty on the 
Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (Additional Protocol) [3] came into force on September 8, 
2000.  
The Safeguards Agreement [2] lays out the safeguards system that Canada shall adhere to, 
including what materials are subject to safeguards, and what information shall be reported to the 
IAEA. As per the Safeguards Agreement, the objective of IAEA safeguards is “the timely 
detection of diversion of significant quantities of nuclear material from peaceful nuclear activities 
February 2018 
REGDOC-2.13.1, Safeguards and Nuclear Material Accountancy 
 
3 
 
to the manufacture of nuclear weapons or of other nuclear explosive devices or for purposes 
unknown, and deterrence of such diversion by the risk of early detection.”  
The Additional Protocol [3] contains further requirements for the provision of information and 
access, including the obligation to allow access to some locations on 24 hours’ notice, and the 
obligation to provide information on and access to certain nuclear manufacturers and researchers, 
neither of which need involve nuclear material. These tools allow the IAEA to have confidence 
that there is an absence of undeclared nuclear material and nuclear activities in Canada.  
2. 
Nuclear Material Classification 
The CNSC has defined two groups and two sub-groups of nuclear material for the purpose of the 
graded application of reporting and access requirements. It is possible for licensees to possess a 
combination of material groups; however, material from different groups shall be stored 
separately. For permissible inventory changes for each group, refer to Appendix D: Table D3. 
2.1 
Group 1 material 
Group 1 material is uranium, plutonium-239, and thorium that are sufficiently pure to be used for 
fuel fabrication or for isotopic enrichment. This includes all materials in the nuclear fuel cycle 
past the point of ore concentrate, or anything created from such materials, including depleted 
uranium. Uranium ore concentrate that meets the purity specifications in table 1 of ASTM C753-
04, Standard Specification for Nuclear-Grade, Sinterable Uranium Dioxide Powder [4] is 
considered to be Group 1 material. Once a given item or batch of nuclear material is considered to 
be Group 1 material, it remains so unless terminated from safeguards by agreement with the 
IAEA. 
2.1.1 
Group 1A material – Full-scope safeguards 
Group 1A material is Group 1 material that is subject to full-scope safeguards – that is, open to 
routine verification by the IAEA and detailed nuclear material accountancy is required (see  
Appendix D: Table D1 for reporting frequencies, and section 6 for further information on IAEA 
access rights applicable to Group 1A material). 
Group 1A material may only be stored at sites categorized as “facilities” or “locations outside 
facilities” for safeguards purposes (see section 3 for categorization of licensees). 
Licensees can seek the termination of safeguards on Group 1A material by submitting a request to 
the CNSC using the “Request for termination” form available on the CNSC’s Safeguards and 
nuclear materials accountancy forms Web page. Termination requests will only be approved by 
the CNSC and IAEA if it is determined that the material has been consumed, or has been diluted 
in such a way that it is no longer usable for any nuclear activity, or has become practicably 
irrecoverable. Material which has been terminated from safeguards ceases to be subject to 
detailed nuclear material accountancy and IAEA access requirements. 
2.1.2 
Group 1B material – Exemption from safeguards 
Group 1B material is Group 1 material that has been exempted from some reporting and 
verification obligations, with permission from both the IAEA and the CNSC. Refer to Appendix 
D: Table D1 for reporting frequencies, and section 6.3 for further information for IAEA access 
rights applicable to Group 1B material. 
February 2018 
REGDOC-2.13.1, Safeguards and Nuclear Material Accountancy 
 
4 
 
Under Article 36 of the Safeguards Agreement [2], nuclear material may be exempted from 
safeguards under the following conditions: 
a) the material is used in gram quantities or less as a sensing component in instruments, or 
b) the material is used in non-nuclear activities, or 
c) the material is plutonium with a plutonium-238 content exceeding 80 percent  
Under Article 37 of the Safeguards Agreement [2], material not fitting the above criteria may still 
be exempted from safeguards if the quantity limits specified for Canada in Article 37 are not 
exceeded. The CNSC tracks the total quantity of material in Canada exempted under Article 37 to 
ensure that these limits are not exceeded. 
Licensees can request that Group 1A material be exempted from safeguards or that Group 1B 
material be de-exempted from safeguards, by submitting a request to the CNSC using the 
“Request for exemption” and “Request for de-exemption” forms available on the CNSC’s 
Safeguards and nuclear materials accountancy forms Web page.  
2.2 
Group 2 material – Ore concentrates 
Group 2 material is uranium and thorium that has not reached the stage in the nuclear fuel cycle 
where the composition and purity is suitable for fuel fabrication or isotopic enrichment. Group 2 
material typically includes only uranium and thorium ore concentrates that do not meet the purity 
specifications in ASTM C753-04 Standard Specification for Nuclear-Grade, Sinterable Uranium 
Dioxide Powder [4]. 
This type of material is not subject to routine verification by the IAEA, but is still subject to some 
access and nuclear material accountancy requirements (see Appendix D: Table D1 for reporting 
frequencies, and section 6.3 for further information on IAEA access rights applicable to Group 2 
material). 
3. 
Categorization of Licensees  
For the purposes of safeguards, licensees are categorized as “facilities”, “locations outside 
facilities”, or “other licensees” according to the criteria below.  
3.1 
Facilities 
Licensees who possess Group 1A material are referred to as facilities for safeguards purposes if 
they meet one of the following criteria: 
a) the licence includes a reactor and/or a critical facility, or, a nuclear material conversion, 
fabrication, reprocessing or isotope separation plant, or, a separate nuclear material storage 
installation, or 
b) the licence includes a location where Group 1A material in amounts greater than 1 effective 
kilogram is customarily used 
3.2 
Locations outside facilities 
Licensees who possess Group 1A material but do not meet the above criteria are referred to as 
locations outside facilities for safeguards purposes.  
February 2018 
REGDOC-2.13.1, Safeguards and Nuclear Material Accountancy 
 
5 
 
3.3 
Other licensees 
Licensees who do not possess Group 1A material, and who:  
a) possess Group 1B or Group 2 material, and/or  
b) conduct nuclear fuel cycle-related research and development activities, and/or  
c) carry out specified nuclear-related manufacturing activities 
 
are referred to as other licensees, and are subject to a reduced set of safeguards requirements.   
4. 
Safeguards Program 
Every licensee categorized as a facility, location outside facility or other licensee shall have a 
documented safeguards program that provides for the fulfillment of applicable safeguards 
requirements:  
 
Safeguards Equipment and Seals (section 5) 
 
IAEA Access (section 6) 
 
Nuclear Material Accountancy (section 7)  
 
Provision of Information (section 8) 
 
Retention of Records (section 9)  
Guidance  
A licensee’s safeguards program should include the measures the licensee will take to ensure that 
the safeguards requirements for that licensee are discharged in a consistent, satisfactory manner. 
Every licensee who possesses nuclear material, or carries out nuclear fuel cycle-related research 
and development activities, or carries out specified nuclear-related manufacturing activities 
should designate a person responsible for the maintenance and fulfillment of that licensee’s 
safeguards program. The identity of this person should be disclosed to the CNSC.  
5. 
Safeguards Equipment and Seals 
Every licensee shall, at the CNSC’s request, install safeguards equipment at the licensed site or 
facilitate the IAEA’s installation of such equipment. Every licensee shall provide the services 
required for the operation of such equipment, in accordance with the specifications provided.  
No licensee shall interfere with or interrupt the operation of safeguards equipment at the facility, 
or alter, deface or break a safeguards seal, except at the CNSC’s request. Every licensee shall 
implement measures to prevent damage to, or the theft, loss, tampering with, or sabotage of 
safeguards equipment, seals, or samples. Licensees shall communicate any such events to their 
own security staff, where such staff exist. 
As per section 30 of the GNSCR, reports shall be provided by licensees to the Commission in the 
event of interference with or an interruption to the operation of safeguards equipment, or the 
alteration, defacement or breakage of a safeguards seal, among other events. 
February 2018 
REGDOC-2.13.1, Safeguards and Nuclear Material Accountancy

Guidance 
Requests to install safeguards equipment at the licensed site will be preceded by consultation with 
the licensee. As per Article 15 of the Safeguards Agreement [2], “…if the Government of Canada 
or persons under its jurisdiction incur extraordinary expenses as a result of a specific request by 
the Agency, the Agency shall reimburse such expenses provided that it has agreed in advance to 
do so.”. 
At licensee sites where safeguards seals and equipment are or are likely to be present, part of a 
licensee’s safeguards program should include familiarizing all relevant persons with the 
requirements surrounding IAEA seals and equipment. Safeguards seals and equipment are more 
commonly used at licensee sites categorized as facilities, and less commonly used at other types 
of licensee sites.  
Licensees should contact the CNSC when it is not clear if there has been interference with or an 
interruption to the operation of safeguards equipment. For instance, most safeguards equipment 
can tolerate short-duration outages to power and/or data connectivity, so such instances may not 
constitute reportable events under section 30 of the GNSCR.  
6. 
International Atomic Energy Agency Access 
Every licensee shall provide access to IAEA inspectors in order to enable the IAEA to verify 
Canada’s declarations to the IAEA, as required by the Canada-IAEA safeguards agreements. The 
IAEA may require access to a given site for a variety of purposes, as described below. 
At the CNSC’s request, licensees shall report to the CNSC on the outcomes of any IAEA 
activities that occur on their sites. 
Guidance 
Licensees can contact the CNSC to verify the identity of IAEA inspectors requesting site access.  
6.1 
Inspections 
The IAEA has the right to carry out inspections at licensees categorized as facilities and locations 
outside facilities. During inspections, the IAEA has the right to verify all Group 1A material on 
the site and to verify relevant records and reports, including safeguards-relevant documentation 
which has not been submitted to the CNSC (such as source data).  
During an inspection, the licensee shall provide a list of inventory items (LII) covering the 
material subject to inspection, and then facilitate IAEA verification of that inventory. Further 
information on the LII is provided in section 8.1.4. The requirement to provide an LII during a 
given type of inspection may be waived by mutual agreement between the licensee, the CNSC 
and the IAEA; for example, LIIs may not be required during some unannounced inspections. 
IAEA inspection activities can include, among other activities: 
 
measurement of nuclear material  
 
taking of samples of nuclear material 
 
review of data from IAEA containment and surveillance equipment 
 
application and verification of IAEA seals 
 
examination of safeguards-relevant records and reports 
February 2018 
REGDOC-2.13.1, Safeguards and Nuclear Material Accountancy 
 
7 
 
For inspections where samples of nuclear material are taken, the licensee shall provide such 
reasonable assistance as is required to enable the shipment of those samples. 
Guidance 
Depending on the size and complexity of the inventory to be verified, the frequency of IAEA 
inspections can vary, and can range in duration from hours to weeks. Notification of an IAEA 
inspection will typically be sent between 24 hours and a week in advance. The IAEA maintains 
the right to carry out unannounced inspections at licensees categorized as facilities with a content 
or annual throughput exceeding five effective kilograms of nuclear material. As a method of 
verifying licensee compliance with CNSC requirements, and of verifying IAEA compliance with 
the Canada-IAEA safeguards agreements, the CNSC will seek to participate in all IAEA 
inspections in Canada, where possible.  
6.2 
Design information verification 
The IAEA has the right to carry out design information verification (DIV) visits at licensees 
categorized as facilities to verify the design information provided by those licensees (see 
section 8.2 for more information on design information requirements). During a DIV, licensees 
shall provide the IAEA with the latest design information submitted to the CNSC, and then 
facilitate IAEA verification of that information. The IAEA will provide one week’s notice for 
DIV visits. As a method of verifying licensee compliance with CNSC requirements, and of 
verifying IAEA compliance with the Canada-IAEA safeguards agreements, the CNSC will seek 
to participate in all IAEA DIVs in Canada, where possible. 
6.3 
Complementary access 
Under the Additional Protocol [3], the IAEA has the right to request complementary access (CA) 
to any location in Canada with at least 24 hours’ notice, or 2 hours’ notice1 if the IAEA is already 
present at a facility or location outside facility, on the same site, for an inspection or DIV.  
Upon receipt of a request for CA, every licensee shall provide the IAEA and CNSC with access 
to any: 
 
location on any site declared as a facility or location outside facility 
 
decommissioned or closed down facility and/or location outside facility 
 
uranium or thorium mine, mill or concentration plant 
 
location possessing, importing or exporting more than 10 metric tonnes of uranium ore 
concentrate and/or more than 20 metric tonnes of thorium ore concentrate in a given calendar 
year 
 
location where materials exempted from safeguards under Article 37 of the Safeguards 
Agreement [2] are stored, or where materials exempted from safeguards under Article 36 of 
the Safeguards Agreement are stored, if those materials are not yet in their non-nuclear end 
use form 
 
location involved in the further processing of wastes containing plutonium, high enriched 
uranium or uranium-233 on which safeguards have been terminated 
For locations subject to CA requests that are not listed above (for example, locations involved in 
nuclear fuel cycle-related research and development activities or specified nuclear-related 
                                                     
 
 
1 As per Article 4b.(ii) of the Additional Protocol [3], in exceptional circumstances, the IAEA may give 
less than two hours’ notice. 
February 2018

manufacturing), upon receipt of a request for CA, every licensee shall make every reasonable 
effort to provide the IAEA and CNSC with access.  
Access shall be provided within the timeframes specified in the notification of CA.  
Guidance 
A CA will only take place during regular working hours. For CAs in remote locations, the IAEA 
typically provides more than 24 hours’ notice. Activities that the IAEA may perform during a CA 
include: 
 
visual observation 
 
collection of environmental samples 
 
utilization of radiation detection and measurement devices 
 
item counting of nuclear material2 
 
application of seals and/or other tamper indicating devices 
 
discussions with persons who are or have been involved in work that is reportable under 
the safeguards agreements 
 
examination of records relevant to the goals of the CA 
IAEA access during a CA can be managed in order to prevent the dissemination of proliferation-
sensitive information, to meet safety or physical protection requirements, and to protect 
proprietary or commercially sensitive information. Any such need for managed access should be 
communicated to the CNSC via the licensee’s annual update under the Additional Protocol [3] 
(see section 8.4 for further details). This does not preclude the possibility of a need for managed 
access arising during the CA. As a method of verifying licensee compliance with CNSC 
requirements, and of verifying IAEA compliance with the Canada-IAEA safeguards agreements, 
the CNSC will seek to participate in all IAEA CAs in Canada, where possible. 
So that licensees may prepare appropriately, the CNSC will notify all licensees on a given site 
whenever the IAEA will be present at that site for an inspection or DIV, with the exception of 
unannounced inspections. 
6.4 
Access to IAEA equipment 
The IAEA has the right to access their installed equipment, including for maintenance and 
servicing. The licensee shall facilitate access to IAEA equipment, including the provision of 
ladders, scaffolding, lifting equipment, or training, as needed.  
Guidance 
Licensees should inform the CNSC of training requirements necessary to access IAEA equipment 
through design information submissions (see section 8.2).  
Note: The IAEA may request access to its equipment on short notice.

7. 
Nuclear Material Accountancy 
Nuclear material accountancy is the program of nuclear material accounting and reporting 
implemented by licensees and the CNSC, to satisfy the requirements of the Safeguards 
Agreement [2]. 
Nuclear material accountancy covers licensee activities carried out to establish the quantities of 
nuclear material present within defined areas, and the changes in those quantities within a defined 
time period. This includes nuclear material measurement, record keeping, preparation and 
submission of accounting reports, and verification of accounting information. For licensees 
possessing Group 1A material, this further includes the establishment of material balance areas 
(MBAs), where flows and inventory of nuclear material can be determined, and key measurement 
points (KMPs) within those MBAs, where flows and inventories of nuclear material can be 
measured. 
7.1 
Measurement of nuclear material 
All licensee safeguards programs shall include the maintenance and calibration of any 
instruments used to measure nuclear material for safeguards purposes. The documented results of 
any calibration activity or measurement of nuclear material are classified as source data and thus 
shall be available on request, including during IAEA inspections.  
Guidance 
In general, instruments used to measure nuclear material should be calibrated at least once in the 
period between physical inventory takings (see section 7.3 below for further detail). The accuracy 
of licensee measurements should meet or exceed the standards set in the IAEA document 
STR-368, International Target Values 2010 for Measurement Uncertainties in Safeguarding 
Nuclear Materials [5], where applicable.  
Rounding errors should be minimized (for example, when a sum of measurements is reported, 
rounding should only be performed for the final reported number). In addition, the number of 
significant digits should reflect the uncertainty in the overall measurement. Measurements should 
be provided with the same number of significant digits in all reports pertaining to the same item 
or batch. 
7.2 
Inventory tracking  
All licensees possessing nuclear material shall be capable, at the CNSC’s request, of providing an 
up-to-date LII, covering all of the Group 1 material in their possession.  
All items in inventory shall be uniquely identified, for instance with a stamped or engraved serial 
number, a label, or a tag, such that a CNSC or IAEA inspector can easily relate the licensee’s LII 
to the physical inventory. 
7.3 
Physical inventory taking 
All licensees categorized as facilities or locations outside facilities shall carry out a physical 
inventory taking (PIT) each calendar year, and not more than 14 months after their previous PIT. 
The licensee’s PIT date shall be declared to the CNSC as part of the annual operational program 
(see section 8.3).  
February 2018 
REGDOC-2.13.1, Safeguards and Nuclear Material Accountancy 
 
10 
 
A licensee’s PIT shall: 
 
confirm the presence of all Group 1 material on the LII  
 
verify that an item’s unique identifier matches the information on the LII 
 
verify that there is no Group 1 material present which is not included on the LII  
The CNSC and/or the IAEA may choose to verify the results of a licensee’s PIT. Should the 
IAEA choose to verify the results of a licensee’s PIT, their inspection is termed a physical 
inventory verification (PIV). Should the CNSC choose to do so, it is termed a physical inventory 
taking evaluation (PIT-E). The PIV and/or PIT-E may occur shortly after the PIT or coincide with 
it. A PIV will involve the verification of some or all Group 1A material onsite at the time of the 
PIT, while a PIT-E will involve the verification of some or all Group 1 material onsite at the time 
of the PIT. Licensees shall be prepared to support an IAEA PIV and/or a CNSC PIT-E following 
each PIT. 
Guidance 
For licensees with large and complex inventories, the PIT should be scheduled to take place when 
nuclear material movements and inventory are at a minimum, and when equipment used to 
process nuclear material can be emptied and cleaned out to the extent reasonably possible. 
Nuclear material that is held up in equipment at the time of a PIT should be sampled and 
analyzed, where possible, to determine characteristics relevant to the determination of nuclear 
material mass. The nuclear material in items that have not changed in mass since the previous 
inventory taking, or since their creation or receipt, does not need to be remeasured as part of a 
PIT. 
In the following cases, Group 1B material may be accounted for using source documents (for 
instance, commercial or shipping documents) that indicate the location of the material:  
 
Group 1B material that is difficult to access; for instance, items stored in sealed 
containers. Documentation should indicate the type and quantity of material in a given 
storage location, and the date at which it became inaccessible.  
 
Group 1B material that is under the ownership of the licensee but that has been 
transferred temporarily at the time of a PIT. Documentation should indicate the location 
of the material and the arrangements in place related to its return. 
The CNSC may select a PIT date for the licensee based on availability of CNSC resources, and in 
consideration of licensee resources. 
7.4 
Inventory difference 
All licensees who carry out a PIT shall calculate inventory difference (ID) as an outcome of that 
PIT, and report it to the CNSC. ID is also known as material unaccounted for (MUF). ID is 
calculated over a material balance period; that is, the interval between two inventory takings.  
ID shall be calculated using the material balance equation provided below:  
ID = BE – PE 
and 
BE = PB + X - Y 
 
 
February 2018 
REGDOC-2.13.1, Safeguards and Nuclear Material Accountancy 
 
11 
 
where 
BE = the book ending inventory; that is, the sum of the physical beginning inventory and all 
inventory changes over the material balance period 
PE = the physical ending inventory, as established by the current inventory taking 
PB = the physical beginning inventory, as established by the previous inventory taking 
X = the sum of all inventory increases over the material balance period 
Y = the sum of all inventory decreases over the material balance period 
ID shall be reported to the CNSC on the following reports:  
 
an inventory change document (ICD), if ID is non-zero (see section 8.1.2)  
 
the final general ledger of the material balance period (applicable only to licensees 
designated as facilities; see section 8.1.3) 
 
the reconciliation statement (see section 8.1.6)  
The CNSC evaluates all instances of ID reported by licensees. On the basis of this evaluation, the 
CNSC may require follow-up actions for instances of a non-zero ID for nuclear material in bulk 
form. Licensees shall investigate any instances of a non-zero ID for nuclear material in item form, 
and  shall communicate the results of the investigation to the CNSC and to their own security 
staff, where such staff exist. Reports on the results of such investigations shall be submitted 
within 30 days of the PIT, shall include the licensees’ conclusions as to the source of ID and any 
correcting measures, and shall be submitted via email to the CNSC safeguards mailbox 
(cnsc.safeguards-garanties.ccsn@canada.ca). 
7.5 
Foreign obligations 
Canada has negotiated nuclear cooperation agreements (NCAs) with nuclear trading partners 
worldwide. When nuclear material is imported into Canada pursuant to the terms and conditions 
of an NCA, it is generally subject to foreign obligations, including a requirement for Canada to 
track and report back on that nuclear material as long as it is in Canada.  
The CNSC will inform the importer at the time an import licence is issued whether a foreign 
obligation will be attributed to the nuclear material. Where there has been no such notification by 
the CNSC, the nuclear material in question is considered unobligated while it remains in Canada.  
All licensees shall track any foreign obligations associated with their nuclear material inventories 
and inventory changes. For further information see sections 8.1.2 and 8.1.7.  
Once assigned, foreign obligations associated with an item shall be kept associated with that item, 
unless the integrity of the item is destroyed through processing. Note that nuclear material can be 
simultaneously obligated to multiple countries.  
Foreign obligations on domestic transfers or internal inventory changes shall be assigned by the 
licensee based on the obligations in their inventory. Foreign obligations on nuclear material to be 
exported from Canada, if any, shall be declared to the CNSC by the licensee as part of the 
application process for a CNSC export licence. If unobligated nuclear material is to be exported 
from Canada for nuclear use, the CNSC will assign a Canadian obligation to that material at the 
time of export.  
Guidance 
For more information on CNSC’s import and export control program, please see regulatory 
document REGDOC-2.13.2, Import and Export.

8. 
Provision of Information 
Licensees shall have measures in place to prevent the compromise of systems used to generate, 
store and transmit safeguards-relevant information. 
All information supplied to the CNSC shall be transmitted using appropriate information security 
measures. Communications up to and including a security level of Protected B can be transmitted 
via the CNSC’s Nuclear Materials Accountancy Reporting (NMAR) e-business system (see 
section 8.1.1), and encrypted email via the CNSC safeguards mailbox (cnsc.safeguards-
garanties.ccsn@canada.ca). Licensees shall make alternate arrangements with the CNSC when 
information to be submitted is Protected C or classified.  
Guidance 
Licensees may refer to CSA standard N290.7-14, Cyber Security for Nuclear Power Plants and 
Small Reactor Facilities [6] for guidance on cyber security for safeguards systems. 
For further guidance on security level classification, licensees may refer to the levels of security 
published by the Government of Canada. For further guidance on the selection of appropriate 
transmittal methods, licensees may refer to the Government of Canada’s Operational Security 
Standard on Physical Security. 
8.1 
Nuclear material accountancy reports 
All licensees who possess nuclear material shall make reports to the CNSC, according to the 
reporting frequencies listed in Appendix D: Table D1. The CNSC may require some reports to be 
submitted more frequently, to support IAEA verification activities. 
Descriptions of the data to be included in each type of report are provided in Appendix D: Table 
D2. Forms for nuclear material accountancy reports are available from the CNSC’s Safeguards 
and nuclear materials accountancy forms Web page. For the Inventory Change Document and the 
Physical-Key Measurement Point Inventory Summary, these shall be the only forms used. 
Alternatively, Extensible Mark-up Language (.xml) specifications can be obtained for these two 
forms, upon request.  
8.1.1 
Electronic reporting  
All licensees who are required to submit nuclear material accountancy reports (see section 8.1), 
shall do so using the NMAR e-business system website.

with the CNSC for files that cannot be submitted via NMAR; for example, because of file size.  
Further information relevant to the use of NMAR is available on the NMAR e-business system 
website.  
8.1.2 
Inventory change document 
An inventory change is any increase or decrease, in terms of batches, in a licensee’s nuclear 
material inventory. All inventory changes shall be reported to the CNSC on an inventory change 
document (ICD), using the inventory change codes defined in Appendix D: Table D3. For all 
shipments of nuclear material, the shipper shall provide a copy of the ICD to the receiver. 
Correcting or deleting an inventory change document 
Corrections to ICDs shall be effected by submitting a correcting ICD with the necessary changes. 
A correcting ICD shall be dated with the current date, not the date on which the original 
transaction occurred. The correcting ICD will be identical to the original, save for the date in 
Label 412, the fields being corrected, the entry of ‘C’ (for ‘correction’) in Label 309, and Label 
1021 being incremented by 1. A note shall be added to the remarks section of a correcting ICD to 
explain the reason for the correction. 
Deleting ICDs can be used to completely withdraw an ICD. Deleting ICDs shall be effected by 
submitting an ICD identical to the original except dated with the current date in Label 412 and the 
entry of ‘D’ for ‘delete’ in Label 309 (Label 1021 remains 0). A note shall be added to the 
remarks section in Label 1004 of deleting ICDs explaining the reason for the deletion. 
Some fields on the ICD (Date, Batch Name, MBA, IC Type, Safeguards Status and Element 
Code, if the change to Element Code impacts the Safeguards Status) cannot be corrected by 
submitting a correcting ICD. In these cases, the original ICD shall be deleted and a new ICD 
submitted. Both the deleting ICD and the new ICD shall be dated with the current date in Label 
412.  
In specific situations and in consultation with the CNSC, a correcting or deleting ICD can be 
reported with a date other than the current date, or an ICD can be withdrawn and replaced without 
modifying Label 309 or Label 1021. 
8.1.3 
General ledger 
A general ledger is a monthly listing of all inventory changes occurring during that month and 
provides the book inventory, that is, a running balance of the material in the MBA.  
General ledgers shall be kept by licensees categorized as facilities; the CNSC will maintain 
general ledgers on behalf of licensees categorized as locations outside facilities. The information 
for an inventory change recorded on the general ledger shall be consistent with information on the 
ICD for each inventory change, with the exception of corrections to weights, as described below, 
February 2018 
REGDOC-2.13.1, Safeguards and Nuclear Material Accountancy 
 
14 
 
under “Recording a correcting or deleting ICD on a general ledger”. A separate general ledger 
shall be submitted for each element/isotope of Group 1A material. 
For months in which no transactions occur, licensees categorized as facilities are not required to 
submit general ledgers to the CNSC. For licensees categorized as facilities, such general ledgers 
are considered to be source data and shall still be created, retained, and provided on request. 
Correcting a general ledger 
Corrections to general ledgers shall be effected by submitting a new report with the revision 
number incremented by 1 and the date of the revision indicated in the appropriate field. 
Recording a correcting or deleting ICD on a general ledger 
When a correcting or deleting ICD is submitted, the correction or deletion shall be recorded on 
the general ledger for the month in which the correction or deletion was reported. For a correcting 
ICD, if the correction is to the weight, then the weight recorded on the general ledger shall be the 
difference between the last reported weight and the corrected weight. For instance, if a weight 
were originally reported as 10 kg and then corrected to 11 kg, the general ledger entry 
corresponding to the correcting ICD would show 1 kg (11kg-10kg), even though the correcting 
ICD continues to state 11 kg. This is the only instance where the weight reported on a general 
ledger is not exactly the same as that reported on the corresponding ICD.  
8.1.4 
List of inventory items 
The LII consists of a listing of Group 1 material. The LII may cover all Group 1 material onsite at 
a given time, as would result from a licensee’s PIT (see section 7.3), or it may cover only a subset 
of Group 1material onsite as needed to support a specific CNSC and/or IAEA inspection activity.  
A separate LII shall be kept for each element/isotope category present onsite. Group 1A and 
Group 1B materials shall be recorded on separate sets of LIIs. An item is generally defined as the 
smallest individually labelled unit in inventory. Licensees shall be able to generate an accurate 
LII upon request. 
Note: LIIs for spent fuel at CANDU stations are a special case, due to the extremely large number 
of items present. For LIIs covering spent fuel at CANDU stations, it is acceptable to provide a 
single line reporting each element present in each KMP, showing the number of bundles and the 
nuclear material mass. Itemized listings covering subsets of the spent fuel inventory shall be 
available on request to facilitate verification activities. At licensee request, the CNSC will 
consider similar arrangements for other large, homogenous inventories. 
Correcting a list of inventory items 
A correction to an LII shall be effected by submitting a new report with the revision number 
incremented by 1 and the date of the revision indicated in the appropriate field. The date on the 
corrected LII report shall stay the same, that is, the date for which the submitted LII was current.

8.1.5 
Physical-key measurement point inventory summary 
The physical-KMP inventory summary (P-KMPIS) is a summary of Group 1A material by 
physical-KMP. The P-KMPIS shall summarize the LII by grouping items with the same material 
description codes into batches. In instances where a licensee possesses small inventories of 
nuclear material, at the licensee’s request, the CNSC may waive the requirement to create and 
report a P-KMPIS. 
Correcting or deleting a physical-key measurement point inventory summary  
Corrections to P-KMPIS reports shall be effected by submitting a new report with the entry of ‘C’ 
for ‘correction’ in Label 309, and Label 1021 being incremented by 1. The date on the P-KMPIS 
report shall stay the same; that is, the date of the PIT being reported on. When submitting a 
correcting P-KMPIS, only the batches that are being corrected shall be included. For instance, if 
an original P-KMPIS had 10 batches and 2 needed correction, the correcting P-KMPIS shows 
only the 2 batches being corrected. 
Deleting a P-KMPIS is done when it is necessary to completely withdraw some or all of the 
reported batches. The deletion shall be effected by submitting a P-KMPIS with the entry of ‘D’ 
for ‘delete’ in Label 309 (Label 1021 remains 0) and listing only the batches that need to be 
withdrawn exactly as they were reported in the original P-KMPIS. A note shall be added to the 
remarks section of correcting and deleting P-KMPIS batches explaining the reason for the 
change. 
Some fields on the P-KMPIS (Date, Batch Name, MBA, Safeguards Status and Element Code, if 
it impacts Safeguards Status) cannot be corrected by submitting a correcting P-KMPIS. In these 
cases, the affected batches on the P-KMPIS shall be deleted and resubmitted on a new P-KMPIS. 
In specific situations and in consultation with the CNSC, a correcting or deleting P-KMPIS can 
be withdrawn and replaced without modifying Label 309 or Label 1021. 
8.1.6 
Reconciliation statement 
A reconciliation statement is a report that calculates ID (see section 7.4); that is, the difference 
between the book ending inventory, derived from the most recent general ledger (for licensees 
categorized as facilities) or the ICDs (for licensees categorized as locations outside facilities), and 
the physical ending inventory, derived from the P-KMPIS or LII. A reconciliation statement shall 
be prepared for Group 1A material after each PIT.  
When a licensee possesses small inventories of nuclear material, at the licensee’s request, the 
CNSC may waive the requirement to create and report a reconciliation statement. 
Correcting a reconciliation statement 
A correction to a reconciliation statement shall be effected by submitting a new report with the 
revision number incremented by 1 and the date of the revision indicated in the appropriate field. 
The date on the reconciliation statement shall stay the same; that is, the PIT date. 
8.1.7 
Obligated material inventory summary 
The obligated material inventory summary (OMIS) is a list of opening and ending balance 
weights, by country of obligation, for any nuclear material that has foreign obligations at the 
licensee’s site. Both Group 1 and Group 2 materials can be subject to foreign obligations. 
February 2018 
REGDOC-2.13.1, Safeguards and Nuclear Material Accountancy 
 
16 
 
The OMIS report covers a calendar year; the opening balance shall be as of January 1 of the 
reporting year, and the closing balance shall be as of December 31 of that same year.  
Unless requested by the CNSC, an OMIS report is not required for any year in which 
foreign-obligated material was not possessed. 
Correcting an obligated material inventory summary 
A correction to an OMIS report is effected by submitting a new report with the revision number 
incremented by 1 and the date of the revision indicated in the appropriate field. The dates on the 
OMIS shall stay the same; that is, January 1 and December 31 for the reporting year. 
8.2 
Design information 
All licensees categorized as facilities or locations outside facilities shall ensure that the CNSC is 
in possession of up-to-date design information. The structure of MBAs and KMPs at a given 
facility or location outside facility shall be accurately described in the design information 
submitted to the CNSC by that licensee. Once the CNSC has reviewed and accepted a licensee’s 
design information, the CNSC will submit it to the IAEA. 
For licensees categorized as facilities, design information shall include all of the following: 
1. the identification of the facility, stating its general character, purpose, nominal capacity and 
geographic location, and the name and address to be used for routine business purposes  
2. a description of the general arrangement of the facility, including site and building maps as 
needed, with reference to the form, location and flow of nuclear material and to the general 
layout of important items of equipment which are used to handle, produce or process nuclear 
material  
3. a description of features of the facility relating to nuclear material accountancy, containment 
and surveillance 
4. a description of the existing and proposed procedures at the facility for nuclear material 
accountancy and control, with special reference to MBAs established by the operator, 
organizational responsibility, measurements of nuclear material, the random and systematic 
uncertainties of such measurements, and procedures for PIT 
5. health and safety procedures that the IAEA shall observe and with which the inspectors shall 
comply at the facility 
For licensees categorized as locations outside facilities, design information shall include all of the 
following: 
1. a general description of the use of the nuclear material, its geographic location, the user's 
name and address for routine business purposes, and site and building maps as needed  
2. a general description of the existing and proposed procedures for nuclear material 
accountancy and control, including organizational responsibility, measurements of nuclear 
material, the random and systematic uncertainties of such measurements, and procedures for 
PIT 
3. health and safety procedures that the IAEA shall observe and with which the inspectors shall 
comply at the facility 
Design information shall be updated and submitted to the CNSC as soon as the decision is taken 
to make changes that would render the information previously provided incomplete or inaccurate. 
For the construction of new facilities or locations outside facilities, preliminary design 
information shall be submitted to the CNSC as soon as the decision to construct or to authorize 
February 2018 
REGDOC-2.13.1, Safeguards and Nuclear Material Accountancy 
 
17 
 
construction has been taken, whichever is earlier. An update to that preliminary design 
information shall be submitted to the CNSC no later than 270 days before the start of 
construction. Similarly, final design information or design information approved for construction 
shall be submitted to the CNSC no later than 270 days before the first receipt of nuclear material 
at the facility. 
Guidance 
Licensees should provide design information on the appropriate IAEA design information 
questionnaire (DIQ) form, available on request from the CNSC. Licensees should review their 
design information annually to verify that it is up to date. The CNSC may require that updates to 
design information be provided on a specified timeline, and the CNSC may request design 
information supplemental to that listed above. 
8.3 
Operational information 
All licensees categorized as facilities shall submit an annual operational program to the CNSC, 
covering safeguards-relevant information for the upcoming calendar year. This program shall be 
submitted to the CNSC by September 30 each year, and shall be updated by the licensee as 
necessary so that the operational program remains current.  
Every facility shall submit an annual operational program that includes all of the following 
information: 
1. the licensee’s preferred PIT date for the upcoming calendar year 
2. any anticipated shutdown periods during the upcoming calendar year 
3. information on expected transfers of nuclear material in the next calendar year 
4. updates on current or upcoming projects of relevance to safeguards, such as the construction 
or decommissioning of a building, the commencement of projects involving nuclear material, 
changes to the types of nuclear material being possessed, etc.  
Guidance 
In consultation with affected licensees, the CNSC may request updates to operational information 
on a more frequent basis, e.g. quarterly or weekly, to facilitate IAEA verification activities. 
Forms for submission of operational data are available on the CNSC’s Safeguards and nuclear 
materials accountancy forms Web page. 
Where there is uncertainty, the CNSC can be contacted for guidance in determining which 
projects are of relevance to safeguards.  
8.4

TW 
The transfer of Group 1A material to retained 
waste, after receipt of approval from the CNSC and 
IAEA.  
 
Material to be designated as retained waste must 
contain nuclear material which is unrecoverable, 
and it must be stored separately from other nuclear 
material. Material designated as retained waste 
remains Group 1A material but is not subject to 
routine IAEA verification and so must not appear 
on the list of inventory items (LII) or Physical-key 
measurement point inventory summary (P-KMPIS) 
for the storing MBA. A separate LII covering only 
retained waste must be available on CNSC request. 
Foreign obligations on retained waste must 
continue to be tracked and reported on the OMIS 
report. Material designated as retained waste 
cannot be processed or transferred out of the MBA, 
without first being transferred back from retained 
waste.

CNSC Regulatory Document Series 
Facilities and activities within the nuclear sector in Canada are regulated by the Canadian Nuclear Safety 
Commission (CNSC). In addition to the Nuclear Safety and Control Act and associated regulations, these 
facilities and activities may also be required to comply with other regulatory instruments such as 
regulatory documents or standards. 
Effective April 2013, the CNSC’s catalogue of existing and planned regulatory documents has been 
organized under three key categories and twenty-five series, as set out below. Regulatory documents 
produced by the CNSC fall under one of the following series:
