Preface 
This regulatory document is part of the CNSC’s human performance management series of regulatory 
documents, which also covers human factors, personnel training and other personnel certification matters. 
The full list of regulatory document series is included at the end of this document and can also be found 
on the CNSC’s website. 
Regulatory document REGDOC-2.2.3, Personnel Certification, Volume III: Certification of Reactor 
Facility Workers, Version 2 sets out the detailed requirements and guidance for the certification of 
workers employed at reactor facilities operated in Canada. 
This document is the second version of REGDOC-2.2.3, Personnel Certification, Volume III: 
Certification of Persons Working at Nuclear Power Plants, published in September 2019. A document 
showing the changes made to the first version is available from the CNSC upon request. 
Complementary regulatory documents 
The requirements and guidance documented in this regulatory document are in addition to the 
requirements and guidance applicable to reactor facility workers in general. Workers certified or seeking 
certification by the CNSC are therefore not exempt from any applicable requirements specified in other 
regulatory documents. 
In particular, this document must be read in conjunction with complementary regulatory documents in the 
human performance management series and other safety and control areas referenced in the licence or any 
accompanying documentation, as applicable. A comprehensive list of complementary regulatory 
documents of relevance is included as “Additional Information” in the last section of this regulatory 
document.

Personnel Certification: Certification of Reactor Facility Workers 
1. 
Introduction 
The Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC) requires that the reactor facility workers 
employed in certain positions of immediate relevance to nuclear safety must be certified by the 
CNSC as qualified to carry out the duties of their employment. For the purpose of this regulatory 
document, said positions are referred to as designated positions. 
1.1 
Purpose 
The purpose of this regulatory document is to specify the detailed requirements and provide 
guidance pertinent to the certification of the reactor facility workers employed or seeking 
employment in designated positions. 
1.2 
Scope 
When referenced in a licence, this regulatory document applies to: 
a. all workers seeking certification by the CNSC, or seeking to maintain or renew such 
certification, for employment in one of the designated positions identified in the licence  
b. the licensee operating the reactor facility identified in the licence 
c. the personnel identified in this regulatory document and involved in the training and 
evaluation, or the certification examination and requalification testing, of workers employed 
or seeking employment in designated positions at the reactor facility identified in the licence 
This regulatory document comprises 3 parts, as follows: 
a. Part I describes the regulatory and procedural devices that make up the CNSC personnel 
certification scheme relevant to reactor facility workers  
b. Part II describes the organizational and physical infrastructures that the licensee must 
implement to support the personnel certification scheme described in Part I and achieve the 
worker qualifications specified in Part III 
c. Part III specifies the prerequisites that reactor facility workers must meet to be eligible for the 
personnel certification processes described in Part I 
 
1.3 
Relevant legislation 
The following provisions of the Nuclear Safety and Control Act (NSCA) and the regulations 
made under it are relevant to this document: 
a. NSCA, paragraphs 21(1)(i), 37(2)(b), 44(1)(k) and 44(1)(l) 
b. General Nuclear Safety and Control Regulations, paragraphs 12(1)(a) and 12(1)(b) 
c. Class I Nuclear Facilities Regulations, section 10, subsections 9(2), 9(3), 9(4), 11(1), 11(2),

Part I – Personnel Certification Scheme 
Part I describes the regulatory and procedural devices that make up the CNSC personnel 
certification scheme relevant to reactor facility workers. 
2. 
Background Information 
The relevant legislation authorizes the Commission and designated officers (DO) to certify 
workers as qualified to carry out their duties, to renew the certification of certified workers, and 
to decertify certified workers following due process. The reactor facility workers certified by the 
CNSC are issued certificates as proof of certification specifying, among other information, a date 
of expiry. In accordance with regulations, certifications issued by the CNSC expire 5 years after 
their date of issuance or renewal. Consequently, authorized applicants must submit applications 
on behalf of the certified workers seeking the renewal of their certification(s) before the expiry 
date specified on each certificate.

Worker competency declaration  
In accordance with regulations, the application shall state that the worker:   
a. meets the applicable qualification requirements referred to in the licence 
b. has successfully completed the applicable training program and examination referred to in the 
licence 
c. is capable, in the opinion of the licensee, of performing the duties of the position 
6.2 
Personnel selection 
The application shall describe how the applicable prerequisites of the personnel selection program 
described in section 14 were met, including, at a minimum: 
a. the worker’s education or literacy level upon selection for initial training 
b. any education or literacy level equivalency recognized by the licensee

which the evaluations, examinations and interview were conducted, not the dates on which their 
grading was finalized.  
6.4 
Supporting documentation 
The licensee is not required to append any supporting documentation to the application as proof 
of competency; however, personnel records shall be maintained in accordance with 
subsection 21.2 and made available for verification by the CNSC upon request. 
6.5 
Application schedule 
The licensee may apply for the certification of a qualified worker at any time.     
6.6 
Effective date of certification 
Unless the licensee requests a deferment, the effective date of the certification will be that of the 
certification decision made by the Commission or a DO. 
6.7 
Certification deferment 
The licensee may request that the effective date of certification be delayed up to 60 calendar days 
from the effective date of application for certification.  
Guidance 
Limitation – In order to provide licensees with scheduling flexibility, the CNSC will consider any 
preference expressed by the authorized applicant regarding the effective date of certification as 
long as the preferred date falls within the aforementioned 60-day period. However, the CNSC is 
not obligated to comply with any request for certification deferment. 
7. 
Application for Certification Renewal  
In addition to the general provisions specified in section 5, an application for the renewal of a 
certification shall meet the requirements specified in this section.      
7.1 
Worker competency declaration 
In accordance with regulations, the application shall state that the worker:   
a. has safely and competently performed the duties of the position for which the worker was 
certified 
b. continues to receive the applicable training referred to in the licence 
October 2023

7.2 
Worker requalification summary  
The application shall provide a chronological summary of the requalification requirements met by 
the worker during the current certification period covering the continuing training components, 
the requalification tests, and all other personnel certification requirements met by the worker.  
The worker requalification summary shall offer sufficient evidence that the worker meets all of 
the applicable requalification requirements specified in Part III. At a minimum, this summary 
shall include, as applicable depending on the designated position: 
a. a confirmation that the worker attended continuing training and successfully underwent 
formal learner evaluations compliant with the requirements specified in section 15, including 
suitable update, refresher, simulator-based and nuclear emergency response training  
b. the dates of all knowledge-based requalification tests successfully completed 
c. the dates of all performance-based requalification tests successfully completed  
d. the number of complete shifts and the number of hours of shiftwork performed in the 
designated position over the current certification period 
e. any remedial action required by CNSC staff as a result of a requalification test administered 
by CNSC staff      
Guidance 
Effective dates – The dates referenced in the worker requalification summary are the dates on 
which the tests were conducted, not the dates on which their grading was finalized.   
7.3 
Supporting documentation 
The licensee is not required to append any supporting documentation to the application as proof 
of competency; however, personnel records shall be maintained in accordance with 
subsection 21.2, and made available for verification by the CNSC upon request. 
 
Guidance 
Applicability – The supporting documentation referenced in this subsection encompasses any 
knowledge or performance-based requalification test that the worker completed during the current 
certification period, in either a lead or supporting role, and whether or not the worker successfully 
completed said test.     
7.4 
Application schedule 
The licensee shall apply for the renewal of the certification of a requalified worker no later than 
the date of expiry specified on the certificate.   
Guidance 
Application deadline – The CNSC will accept any certification renewal application duly signed 
and dated before midnight on the day of the certificate expiry, as long as the application is 
received by the CNSC before midnight on the same day for an electronic submission, or within a 
October 2023 
REGDOC-2.2.3, Personnel Certification, Volume III: Certification of Reactor Facility Workers 
 
20 
 
reasonable time frame for a printed application sent by mail or courier. When the licensee fails to 
meet this application deadline, section 8 applies instead of section 7.  
Normal processing time – In order to avoid having to remove the worker from duty in accordance 
with sub-subsection 20.4.4 followed by a reinstatement as per subsection 20.5 and sub-
subsection 20.6.4, the application should be made well in advance of the certificate expiry date, 
preferably allowing for a normal processing time of 60 calendar days.   
Incomplete application – When a certification renewal application submitted before the deadline 
is found to be or remains incomplete after the certificate has expired, the application will be 
accepted, but the technical assessment will be paused until a revised application or additional 
information is submitted by the licensee to the satisfaction of the CNSC. 
Prohibited employment – When the certificate expires while the certification renewal application 
is being processed by CNSC staff, the worker is considered no longer qualified to work in the 
pertinent designated position until the certification has been officially renewed by the CNSC. 
7.5 
Effective date of renewal 
When the application is signed and dated by an authorized applicant no earlier than 90 calendar 
days before the certification expiry, the effective date of the certification renewal will be made to 
coincide with the date of expiry of the existing certification.  
7.6 
Early certification renewal 
When the application is signed and dated by an authorized applicant earlier than 90 calendar days 
before the certification expiry, the effective date of the certification renewal will be that of the 
certification decision made by the Commission or a DO. 
Guidance 
Limitation – In order to provide licensees with scheduling flexibility, the CNSC allows the 
renewal of the certification of reactor facility workers before the end of the certificate validity 
period. This allowance is made because shortening the certification period effectively increases 
the requalification testing frequency. However, in order to ensure that the proof of worker 
competency provided at the time of application is relatively recent, and therefore valid, the CNSC 
will not postpone the effective date of any early certification renewal beyond the processing time 
actually incurred. Authorized applicants should therefore plan ahead and duly consider the time 
constraints specified in this section before submitting certification renewal applications. 
Certificate expiry – In all cases, when the certificate expires before the application can be 
processed by CNSC staff and a renewed certificate issued by the CNSC, the effective date of the 
certification renewal will be made to coincide with the date of expiry of the existing certification. 
The certification expiry date is the latest certification renewal date regardless of any other 
consideration since the Commission or a DO may only renew an existing certification.    
8. 
Application for Recertification Within 5 Years of a Certificate Expiry  
In addition to the general provisions specified in section 5, an application for recertification 
submitted no later than 5 years following the expiry of a certificate shall meet the requirements 
specified in this section. 
October 2023 
REGDOC-2.2.3, Personnel Certification, Volume III: Certification of Reactor Facility Workers 
 
21 
 
Guidance  
Applicability – This section applies to the recertification of a worker for employment in the same 
designated position as the one identified on an expired certificate when the authorized applicant 
has failed to submit a certification renewal application before the certification renewal deadline 
specified in subsection 7.4.  
8.1 
Worker competency declaration  
In accordance with regulations, the application shall state that the worker:   
a. meets the applicable qualification requirements referred to in the licence 
b. has successfully completed the applicable training program and examination referred to in the 
licence 
c. is capable, in the opinion of the licensee, of performing the duties of the position 
Guidance 
Important note – To satisfy the condition set by subsection 9(2) of the Class I Nuclear Facilities 
Regulations, the correct worker competency declaration in the context of an application for 
recertification is the same as the competency declaration required for a certification.  
8.2 
Worker requalification summary 
The application shall provide a chronological summary of a suitable reinstatement process, 
specifying the effective date of completion of each step, including, at a minimum: 
a. the tailored training, including any knowledge and performance-based refresher and update 
training, completed by the worker 
b. the knowledge-based requalification test successfully completed by the worker 
c. the performance-based requalification test or series of tests successfully completed by the 
worker  
d. the number of hours of WUS completed by the worker 
e. the management interview 
The applicable worker requalification requirements are specified in Part III. 
Guidance 
Notwithstanding the worker competency declaration required by the pertinent regulations, the 
“examination” referenced in subsection 8.1 is the suite of requalification tests specified in 
subsections 8.2 and 24.4. Neither the legislative basis nor the licence makes any reference to a 
recertification examination; rather, the applicable licences reference this regulatory document as 
an added source of specificity. Therefore, based on the graded approach, the CNSC considers it 
sufficient that a worker whose certificate expired less than 5 years ago be examined using 
requalification tests in lieu of the full suite of certification examinations initially required at the 
time of certification.

c. may recognize equivalencies to any minimum education, literacy, or numeracy level set by 
the licensee  
d. shall use standardized tests and proven methods to assess whether or not candidates selected 
on the basis of a literacy or numeracy level, or a recognized equivalency, do in fact meet the 
applicable minimum standards 
e. shall determine whether or not prior work experience may be desirable or essential and, when 
deemed essential, develop plans and procedures to ensure candidates gain relevant work 
experience prior to their entry in a suitable initial training program  
f. shall identify attributes and aptitudes deemed essential to safely and competently perform the 
duties of the designated position, including integrity, leadership, and resilience, as may be 
pertinent, and select candidates accordingly  
g. may use standardized tests and proven methods, or require a medical assessment performed 
by a licensed physician, to assess whether or not candidates have any permanent, physical or

mental limitation that would prevent them from performing the duties of the pertinent 
designated position safely and competently 
 
Guidance  
 
Prior education – The licensee should set personnel selection criteria based on a considered 
rationale, and avoid setting prescriptive requirements for the sake of expediency, including 
specific education prerequisites, if suitable candidates may thereby be unduly excluded. The 
CNSC recognizes that modern learners may acquire acceptable levels of prior knowledge and 
literacy through various methods and avenues, including distance learning and homeschooling, 
and from jurisdictions other than provincial authorities, depending on individual circumstances.  
Work experience – In the context of the personnel selection program, relevant work experience 
means any employment in a role or position of an operational or technical nature providing:  
a. the candidate with: 
i. 
meaningful exposure to the organization and the daily operation of a reactor facility in 
some way relevant to the duties of the pertinent designated position 
ii. an opportunity to develop transferable knowledge and skills (K&S) and safety-related 
attributes that will eventually be valuable to the successful candidate once employed in a 
designated position  
b. the management team with an opportunity to evaluate the prospective candidate against the 
pertinent personnel selection criteria, in particular any essential safety-related attributes, 
including integrity, leadership and resilience, as applicable 
14.2 
Personnel selection criteria 
14.2.1 Basic prerequisites

14.3 
Selection of reactor operators for shift supervisor training  
A worker certified or previously certified for employment as reactor operator (RO) at the reactor 
facility identified in the licence may be selected for entry in an initial training program for shift 
supervisor candidates in accordance with the requirements specified in this subsection. 
14.3.1 Performance as reactor operator 
Prior to being selected for shift supervisor training, the worker must: 
a. have performed the duties of an RO safely and competently  
b. be known to possess the safety-related attributes and aptitudes required of a shift supervisor  
14.3.2 Personnel selection exemption 
The licensee may, if the worker has been regularly employed as a certified RO for at least 
4 calendar quarters, exempt the worker from any education level or work experience normally 
required of shift supervisor candidates. 
Guidance 
Regulatory intent – Since the worker is to be exempted from prerequisites considered essential by 
the licensee for other candidates, the worker is to have consistently demonstrated shift supervisor 
potential over a meaningful observation period. 
Regular employment – “Regularly employed” means that the worker, at a minimum, met the 
pertinent quarterly minimum shift requirement; however, the required 4 calendar quarters need 
not be consecutive.           
14.3.3 Notification of selection for shift supervisor training 
The licensee shall notify the CNSC within a reasonable time frame when a worker referred to in 
this subsection enters an initial training program for shift supervisor candidates. This 
communication shall include: 
a. the full legal name of the worker 
b. a confirmation that the worker performed the duties of an RO safely and competently  
c. a confirmation that the worker possesses the safety-related attributes and aptitudes required of 
a shift supervisor  
d. a summary of any exemption explicitly sanctioned in sub-subsection 14.3.2 and employed as 
part of the selection of the worker, including the start and end dates of the observation 
period(s) adding to 4 calendar quarters in total 
Guidance 
In accordance with subsection 6.2, the application for certification includes a summary of any 
exemption(s) employed as part of the selection of the worker for shift supervisor training, in 
addition to the notification specified in this sub-subsection.

14.4 
Advancement to senior shift supervisor 
Any certified shift supervisor who, as a member of the minimum staff complement (MSC), 
exercises authority over any number of certified shift supervisors shall, prior to being employed 
in such a senior shift supervisor position, have been selected and trained by the licensee for the 
express purpose by means of a documented process meeting the requirements specified in this 
subsection.  
The licensee shall not allow any worker to act as senior shift supervisor who is not duly qualified 
to exercise authority over other certified shift supervisors in accordance with the aforementioned 
process. 
Guidance 
Applicability – This subsection applies when the management system implemented at the reactor 
facility requires the presence of at least one senior shift supervisor having authority over at least 
one shift supervisor as part of the MSC.  
Special circumstances – The CNSC recognizes that, at reactor facilities employing senior shift 
supervisors, the role and responsibilities of all shift supervisors may entail making 
safety-significant or otherwise time-sensitive decisions when the senior shift supervisor on duty is 
indisposed or unavailable. Nothing in this regulatory document should be construed as preventing 
any certified shift supervisor acting as a member of the MSC from making operational or 
safety-critical decisions normally delegated to the senior shift supervisor as the situation dictates. 
14.4.1 Minimum experience as shift supervisor prior to advancement 
The worker must have safely and competently performed the duties of a shift supervisor at the 
reactor facility identified in the licence for a minimum number of complete shifts acceptable to 
the CNSC, adding to a minimum number of hours of shiftwork acceptable to the CNSC. 
Guidance 
Compliance scheme – Appendix B specifies the minimum numbers of complete shifts and hours 
of shiftwork acceptable to the CNSC for the pertinent reactor facilities in service at the time of 
publication of the current version of this regulatory document. 
14.4.2 Supplemental training 
The worker must have successfully completed training based on a training system, including 
some on-the-job training (OJT), covering the K&S and safety-related attributes required to safely 
and competently perform the duties of the senior shift supervisor, as defined by the licensee’s 
management system. 
14.4.3 Work under supervision 
The worker must have performed the duties of the senior shift supervisor under the supervision of 
a qualified senior shift supervisor for a number of complete shifts that the licensee considers 
necessary to confirm that the worker can perform said duties competently and safely. 
October 2023 
REGDOC-2.2.3, Personnel Certification, Volume III: Certification of Reactor Facility Workers 
 
31 
 
14.4.4 Notification of advancement to senior shift supervisor  
The licensee shall notify the CNSC within a reasonable time frame when a worker certified as 
shift supervisor has obtained a senior shift supervisor qualification. This communication shall 
include: 
a. the full legal name of the worker 
b. a summary, showing the effective date of completion in each case, of the requirements 
successfully met by the worker as part of the advancement process specified in this section 
 
14.5 
Personnel transfer 
The licensee shall implement and document an effective personnel transfer process compliant 
with the requirements and guidance specified in this subsection. 
Guidance 
Applicability – This section applies to the case of a worker who will be seeking certification for 
employment in a designated position at the reactor facility identified in the licence (the gaining 
reactor facility) after being transferred from another reactor facility of an equal or comparable 
design (the ceding reactor facility). When a worker is transferred between reactor facilities 
differing significantly in design or concept of operation, the worker should be hired and trained as 
any other candidate in accordance with the established personnel selection process and by means 
of the full, applicable initial training program.  
14.5.1 Personnel transfer process 
As an integral part of the personnel transfer process, the licensee of the gaining reactor facility: 
a. shall request, from the licensee of the ceding reactor facility: 
i. 
the training and qualification records and, if applicable, the certification examination 
history of the worker, including sufficient proof of any certification examination 
successfully completed by the worker 
ii. confirmation that the worker performed their duties in a safe and competent manner, be it 
in a designated position or not 
iii. confirmation that the worker is trustworthy 
b. shall ensure that the worker meets all of the applicable personnel selection criteria in effect at 
the gaining reactor facility prior to the worker’s entering one of the initial training programs 
referenced in this regulatory document 
c. may administer a single or a series of standardized general knowledge test(s) based on proven 
methods to identify any gaps in the general knowledge of the worker 
d. may use the results of the aforementioned general knowledge test(s) as part of the basis for 
the development of an individual training needs analysis (ITNA) and an individual training 
plan (ITP), on a case-by-case basis 
e. may administer a general knowledge certification examination to the worker in order to 
ascertain that the worker possesses adequate general knowledge 
f. may employ one or both potential exemptions explicitly sanctioned in this subsection  
October 2023 
REGDOC-2.2.3, Personnel Certification, Volume III: Certification of Reactor Facility Workers 
 
32 
 
Guidance 
Best practice – The CNSC recognizes that the gaining reactor facility licensee cannot be held 
accountable for a refusal, on the part of the ceding reactor facility licensee, to share personal 
information related to the worker, and will therefore not fault the licensee if the ceding facility 
refuses to transmit the information referenced under paragraph 14.5.1.a. Nevertheless, the gaining 
reactor facility licensee should ascertain, to the fullest extent possible, the suitability of the 
worker as a candidate for the applicable initial training program. 
14.5.2 Initial training 
Except for the potential exemption explicitly sanctioned in sub-subsection 14.5.3, the worker 
shall successfully complete the same initial training that is administered to all workers seeking 
certification for employment in the pertinent designated position at the gaining reactor facility. 
14.5.3 General knowledge training exemption 
The licensee is not obligated to administer additional general knowledge training to the worker if 
the worker has previously successfully completed general knowledge training that: 
a. is equivalent to the general knowledge training administered to all workers seeking 
employment in the same designated position at the gaining reactor facility   
b. was administered in accordance with the applicable requirements specified in this and 
complementary regulatory documents 
c. is, in all other respects, acceptable to the gaining reactor facility licensee  
Guidance  
Limitation – The general knowledge training is the only component of any initial training 
program specified in this regulatory document from which the worker may be exempted. 
SHP candidates – The licensee may exempt SHP candidates meeting the exemption criteria 
specified in this sub-subsection from the applicable general training program. However, such 
candidates shall successfully complete tailored training covering, at a minimum, the relevant 
station-specific knowledge.  
14.5.4 Certification examinations 
Except for the potential exemption explicitly sanctioned in sub-subsection 14.5.5, the worker 
shall successfully complete the same certification examinations as those administered to all 
workers seeking certification for employment in the pertinent designated position at the gaining 
reactor facility. 
14.5.5 General knowledge examination exemption 
The licensee is not obligated to administer an additional general knowledge certification 
examination to the transferred worker if the worker previously received a passing grade on a 
general knowledge examination that: 
a. is equivalent to the general knowledge examination administered to all workers seeking 
employment in the same designated position at the gaining reactor facility   
October 2023 
REGDOC-2.2.3, Personnel Certification, Volume III: Certification of Reactor Facility Workers 
 
33 
 
b. was administered by qualified examiners in accordance with the conditions set in the gaining 
reactor facility licence or accompanying document, including any detailed requirements 
specified in documents referenced in the licence or accompanying document 
c. is, in all other respects, acceptable to the gaining reactor facility licensee  
Guidance  
Limitation – The general knowledge certification examination is the only personnel certification 
examination from which the transferred worker may be exempted. Furthermore, SHP candidates 
are not eligible for the exemption specified in this sub-subsection, since CNSC staff administer 
SHP certification examinations and requalification tests covering both the general and station-
specific knowledge.     
14.5.6 Notification of personnel transfer 
The licensee shall notify the CNSC within a reasonable time frame when a worker referred to in 
this subsection enters an initial training program referenced in this regulatory document. This 
communication shall include: 
a. the full legal name of the worker 
b. a summary of any exemption(s) explicitly sanctioned in subsection 14.5 and employed as part 
of the selection of the worker, including, as applicable: 
i. 
the start and end dates of the general training referenced as basis for the exemption and 
the licensee and reactor facility responsible for the associated general training program 
ii. 
the date on which the general certification examination referenced as basis for the 
exemption was administered and the licensee and reactor facility responsible for its 
administration   
 
14.5.7 Added information upon application for certification   
At the time of application for certification, the worker shall meet all of the personnel certification 
requirements applicable to any worker seeking certification for employment in the pertinent 
designated position at the reactor facility identified in the licence.  
In addition to the requirements specified in subsection 6.2 and the notification specified in this 
subsection, the application for certification shall include a summary of any ITNA, ITP and 
certification examination employed as part of the transfer of the worker. 
Guidance 
Exemption basis – The potential exemptions referenced in this section assume an adequate degree 
of equivalency between the general training and the general knowledge examination successfully 
completed by the candidate and those administered at the gaining reactor facility. The CNSC is 
not obligated to certify any worker previously granted an exemption by the licensee if the CNSC 
is not satisfied that a sufficient degree of equivalency did in fact exist when the exemption was 
granted. The licensee should consult CNSC staff when in doubt.               
Licensee discretion – The potential exemptions referenced in this section are not mandatory. The 
gaining reactor facility licensee remains free to require that the transferred worker successfully 
complete additional general training and an additional general knowledge examination, regardless 
October 2023 
REGDOC-2.2.3, Personnel Certification, Volume III: Certification of Reactor Facility Workers 
 
34 
 
of any general training or certification examination previously successfully completed by the 
transferred worker. 
15. 
Training Programs 
15.1 
Initial training programs 
The licensee shall implement and document initial training programs specifically designed to 
prepare workers for employment in each designated position identified in the licence, and to 
qualify the said workers for certification by the CNSC in accordance with the applicable worker 
qualifications specified in Part III. 
15.2 
Continuing training programs 
The licensee shall implement and document continuing training programs specifically designed to 
maintain the competency of workers employed in each designated position identified in the 
licence, and to requalify the said workers prior to the renewal of their certification by the CNSC 
in accordance with the applicable worker requalification requirements specified in Part III.  
Guidance 
Purpose – The purpose of the continuing training programs is to ensure that certified workers:  
a. retain the essential K&S and safety-related attributes acquired during their initial training  
b. acquire new K&S and safety-related attributes as necessary to deal successfully with the 
relevant procedural and technical changes implemented over time 
15.2.1 Update training 
The pertinent continuing training programs shall include suitable update training, including 
formal knowledge and performance-based evaluations, covering any relevant technical or 
procedural changes implemented at the reactor facility identified in the licence, as well as the 
relevant lessons learned by the industry over time, including, but not limited to: 
a. changes to reactor facility systems and subsystems 
b. changes to licensee and station-specific policies, standards, and procedures

e. station-specific and industry operational experience and operating events 
The licensee shall deliver the knowledge update training referenced in this regulatory document 
promptly following the occurrence of the initiating change or event using effective instructional 
methods, including suitable simulator-based training whenever pertinent. 
Guidance 
Regulatory expectation – In order to ensure that certified workers can perform their duties safely 
and competently at all times, update training is to be delivered in a timely manner. Certified 
workers should attend update training as soon as feasible depending on circumstances and the 
safety significance of the change(s). Safety-critical changes should be communicated to 
October 2023 
REGDOC-2.2.3, Personnel Certification, Volume III: Certification of Reactor Facility Workers 
 
35 
 
operations personnel during turnovers if update training cannot be delivered to the shift crew 
beforehand.                
15.2.2 Refresher training 
The pertinent continuing training programs shall incorporate suitable refresher training, including 
formal knowledge and performance-based evaluations, covering the essential K&S and safety-
related attributes that certified workers acquired during their initial training and which must be 
periodically reviewed and applied to ensure adequate retention.  
The licensee shall deliver the knowledge refresher training referenced in this regulatory document 
on a regular basis and according to a training cycle not exceeding 5 years using effective 
instructional methods, including suitable simulator-based training whenever pertinent. 
Guidance 
Best practice – Allowing for individual circumstances, certified workers should attend sufficient 
refresher training to review all the applicable K&S and safety-related attributes during each 
5-year certification period preceding a renewal of their certification.   
15.2.3 Simulator-based continuing training for operations personnel   
The continuing training programs for operations personnel shall include suitable simulator-based 
training designed to ensure that operations personnel maintain their qualification by applying 
their K&S and safety-related attributes through recurrent performance-based training covering 
varied simulated scenarios under normal, abnormal and, to the extent possible, emergency 
conditions. 
At a minimum, the continuing simulator-based training for operations personnel shall include:   
a. simulator-based exercises covering the normal reactor manoeuvres and plant evolutions 
infrequently performed by certified workers while on duty 
b. simulator-based exercises covering varied scenarios: 
i. 
challenging the diagnostic and decision-making abilities of certified workers 
ii. ensuring that certified workers remain proficient in selecting and executing the correct 
operational procedures under abnormal and emergency conditions 
c. exercises and drills ensuring that certified workers are ready to respond to accidents and 
emergencies 
Guidance  
Best practice – The simulator-based continuing training should in particular cover those situations 
requiring that safety-significant and time-sensitive decisions be made and implemented promptly 
in order to prevent harm to workers, the public or the environment.      
15.2.4 Nuclear emergency response training 
The licensee shall conduct, on a periodic basis, nuclear emergency response training to ensure 
that certified workers are adequately prepared to respond to credible beyond-design-basis 
accidents and manage nuclear emergencies in accordance with the established emergency 
operating procedures and severe accident management guidelines. 
October 2023 
REGDOC-2.2.3, Personnel Certification, Volume III: Certification of Reactor Facility Workers 
 
36 
 
Guidance  
Instructional strategies and methods – Nuclear emergency response training should focus on the 
roles and responsibilities relevant to certified workers, and may be delivered through any 
effective means, from classroom (tabletop) exercises to the participation of certified workers in 
full-scale nuclear emergency response exercises. 
Complementary regulatory documents – Further requirements and guidance pertinent to the 
personnel involved in accident management and in nuclear emergency preparedness and response 
can be found in the relevant complementary regulatory documents listed as “Additional 
Information” in the last section of this regulatory document.  
15.3 
Training system for reactor facilities     
The initial and continuing training programs referenced in this regulatory document shall be 
consistent with a training system for reactor facilities acceptable to the CNSC.  
When the licensee contracts out, in whole or in part, any aspect of the training referenced in this 
regulatory document, the licensee shall ensure that the requirements and guidance specified in 
this and any relevant complementary regulatory document are complied with by the contracted 
party or parties.  
Guidance 
Instructional strategies and methods – In implementing and administering the initial and 
continuing training referenced in this regulatory document, the licensee is free to employ any 
effectual instructional strategies and any combination of recognized instructional methods, 
including self-paced learning, remote learning, and e-learning.  
Complementary regulatory document – Further requirements and guidance pertaining to 
personnel training, including training systems, can be found in the relevant complementary 
regulatory documents listed as “Additional Information” in the last section of this regulatory 
document.   
Training program samples – Appendix D contains examples of training programs initially 
implemented at CANada Deuterium Uranium (CANDU) reactor facilities and found acceptable 
by the CNSC. Notwithstanding this added guidance, a suitable training program is based on a 
reactor facility training system, as mandated by the CNSC. 
15.4 
Formal learner evaluations 
All training programs and tailored training referenced in this regulatory document shall include 
formal learner evaluations, either knowledge-based or performance-based as appropriate, 
designed to assess the progress of each learner during the course of said training.     
The licensee shall administer all such formal learner evaluations in accordance with a 
documented process specifying: 
a. the number and scope of the formative and summative evaluations deemed necessary to 
monitor candidate progress in relation to pertinent training segments and milestones 
October 2023 
REGDOC-2.2.3, Personnel Certification, Volume III: Certification of Reactor Facility Workers 
 
37 
 
b. the requirements and procedures applicable to the design, development, conduct and grading 
of the evaluations 
c. the qualification requirements for the personnel tasked with designing, developing, 
conducting, and grading the evaluations 
All formal learner evaluations shall be administered either by qualified trainers or by qualified 
examiners as part of a documented instructional strategy.  
Guidance 
Purpose – The purpose of the formal learner evaluations differs from that of the certification 
examinations and requalification tests in that the former provide timely measures of learner 
progression throughout training, while the latter serve as formal proof of worker competency for 
the purpose of seeking certification by the CNSC. The results of the learner evaluations can also 
be used to provide learners with feedback, and to help managers and trainers determine an 
appropriate time, on a group or individual basis, when the examiners should administer the 
personnel certification examinations and the requalification tests required by the CNSC.  
15.5 
Trainer qualifications 
The licensee shall ensure that the personnel tasked with administering the training and formal 
learner evaluations referenced in this regulatory document are duly qualified to administer 
training and formal learner evaluations to the workers certified or seeking certification by the 
CNSC.  
16. 
Certification Examinations and Requalification Testing 
16.1 
Separation of the training and examination functions 
The licensee shall ensure that, to the greatest extent possible, adequate separation and an 
arm’s-length relationship are maintained between the trainers delivering the training referenced in 
this regulatory document and the examiners administering certification examinations and 
requalification tests on behalf of the CNSC. At a minimum:  
a. no knowledge or performance-based certification examination or requalification test 
administered in accordance with the requirements specified in this regulatory document shall 
be designed, developed, conducted, or graded, in whole or in part, by an examiner acting as 
trainer to any of the candidates undergoing the examination or test  
b. no trainer or examiner shall benefit, financially or otherwise, from the success rate of the 
candidates undergoing any formal learner evaluation, certification examination, or 
requalification test referenced in this regulatory document.   
Guidance  
Purpose – The purpose of maintaining sufficient separation between trainers and examiners is to 
ensure that the primary proof of competency required by the CNSC at the time of certification or 
certification renewal, namely the results of the certification examinations or requalification tests, 
was obtained by qualified examiners independently of the pertinent trainers. In the personnel 
certification context, the examiners’ opinion of worker competency must be an autonomous 
validation of the trainers’ opinion on the matter since the examiners are tasked with representing 
the certifying body rather than the employer. This separation is a fundamental aspect of best 
October 2023 
REGDOC-2.2.3, Personnel Certification, Volume III: Certification of Reactor Facility Workers 
 
38 
 
practice for certifying bodies. The Commission or DO requires satisfactory proof of competency 
in order to form a sensible opinion of worker competency prior to making any personnel 
certification decision. 
Best practice – Ideally, the training and examination personnel should be members of distinct 
staffs, led by different managers; however, the CNSC recognizes that this level of separation is 
neither essential nor always feasible.         
16.2 
Certification examinations   
The licensee shall ensure that the knowledge and performance-based certification examinations 
referenced in this regulatory document are designed, developed, conducted, and graded by 
qualified examiners in accordance with the applicable CNSC requirements specified or 
referenced in the licence or any accompanying documentation. 
16.3 
Requalification testing   
The licensee shall ensure that the knowledge and performance-based requalification tests 
referenced in this regulatory document are designed, developed, conducted, and graded by 
qualified examiners in accordance with the applicable CNSC requirements specified or 
referenced in the licence or any accompanying documentation. 
16.4 
Security of certification examinations and requalification tests 
The licensee shall implement and document effective policies and procedures to control access to, 
and the use of, the formal learner evaluations, certification examinations and requalification tests 
referenced in this regulatory document.  
The associated security measures shall meet the following minimum requirements: 
a. Only personnel with a valid need to know shall have access to the pertinent formal learner 
evaluations, certification examinations and requalification tests, as well as any associated 
documentation and materials providing a direct clue as to their content. 
b. Trainers shall not have access to, or prior knowledge of, the specific content of any 
certification examination or requalification test administered to their learners. 
c. Answers to modified essay question (MEQ) examinations and tests shall be protected from 
unauthorized access. 
d. Answer keys to multiple choice question (MCQ) examinations and tests shall be protected 
from unauthorized access. 
e. Any repository, physical or virtual, containing MEQ or MCQ examinations and test questions 
shall be protected from unauthorized access. 
f. In order to discharge their duties, CNSC staff participating in compliance verification 
activities shall be exempt from any security measure established by the licensee in 
accordance with the requirements specified in this subsection. 
Guidance 
CNSC staff access – CNSC staff will take appropriate precautions consistent with the security 
standards applicable to federal employees and the security measures specified in this subsection. 
In addition, CNSC staff will respect the pertinent licensee procedures to the fullest extent 
possible. However, no CNSC inspector or any other member of an inspection team may be denied 
October 2023 
REGDOC-2.2.3, Personnel Certification, Volume III: Certification of Reactor Facility Workers 
 
39 
 
access to any information required by CNSC staff members to discharge their duties under the 
NSCA. 
16.5 
Examiner qualifications 
The licensee shall ensure that the personnel tasked with administering the certification 
examinations and requalification tests referenced in this regulatory document have successfully 
completed suitable training and are duly qualified to administer certification examinations and 
requalification tests to the workers certified or seeking certification by the CNSC.   
17. 
Work Under Supervision 
The licensee shall establish and document, for each pertinent designated position identified in the 
licence, effective procedures for the administration of the work under supervision (WUS) 
referenced in this regulatory document.  
All mandatory WUS periods shall meet the following objectives:  
a. WUS shall provide the worker being evaluated with a meaningful opportunity to demonstrate 
a functional level of competency and the ability to stand solo shifts as lead operator or shift 
supervisor 
b. WUS shall provide operations managers with a sufficient observation period to confirm that 
the worker being evaluated can be trusted to stand solo shifts as lead operator or shift 
supervisor and can perform the pertinent duties safely and competently 
When implemented as part of an initial training program, WUS shall not begin until the 
responsibility for the learner’s performance has been transferred from the training authority to the 
operations authority.      
Guidance  
Supervising authority – Given that WUS primarily serves a performance evaluation function 
rather than a training function, WUS periods are supervised by certified operations personnel 
under the authority of the operations management team. When attending an initial training 
program, the learner should have acquired a functional level of competency prior to the start of 
the WUS period.  
On-the-job training – Notwithstanding the primary purpose of the mandated WUS, the licensee 
may conduct OJT and mentorship during any WUS period, notably as an integral part of an initial 
training program.   
18. 
Management Interviews 
The licensee shall establish and document effective procedures for preparing and conducting the 
various management interviews referenced in this regulatory document.  
Each mandatory management interview shall serve an evaluation function and: 
a. be conducted orally by a minimum of one manager authorized to represent the licensee and to 
conduct the interview 
October 2023 
REGDOC-2.2.3, Personnel Certification, Volume III: Certification of Reactor Facility Workers 
 
40 
 
b. provide the worker being evaluated with a meaningful opportunity to demonstrate an 
adequate level of competency 
c. provide at least one member of the operations management team with a meaningful 
opportunity to make a final determination of worker competency  
d. be recorded in writing or via any other retrievable medium, the record of which shall be 
retained and made available to the CNSC upon request 
Guidance 
Purpose – The purpose of the management interview is to ensure that the licensee and the 
operations management team make a final determination of adequate worker competency and 
take ownership of each candidate individually, prior to their presentation for CNSC certification 
or their reinstatement to duty following a removal for cause. 
19. 
Administrative Policies and Procedures Applicable to Workers in Training  
The policies and procedures specified in this section apply to any worker, whether certified or 
not, who is attending one of the initial training programs referenced in this regulatory document, 
in the context of, and in relation to, said training.   
19.1 
Reintegration of a worker in training following a prolonged training interruption  
The licensee shall establish and document an effective process to manage the case of any worker 
reintegrating an initial training program after a prolonged training interruption. As an integral part 
of this process, the licensee shall: 
a. determine the need for, and perform as necessary, a formal learner evaluation, including 
knowledge and performance-based testing as warranted, to assess the K&S retention of the 
worker and to identify any K&S gap that the worker may have developed during the period of 
absence  
b. determine the need for tailored training based on an individual training needs analysis 
(ITNA), considering any K&S forgotten by the worker and any changes or updates to the 
essential K&S and safety-related attributes that occurred during the period of absence 
c. formulate and implement an individual training plan (ITP) as may be necessary 
d. ensure that the worker, at a minimum, successfully completes any training and formal learner 
evaluation(s) missed during the period of absence  
e. determine a suitable point of re-entry into the pertinent initial training program  
At a minimum, any worker who is absent from an initial training program for a period of 
6 months or more shall undergo a formal reintegration process meeting the requirements specified 
in this subsection.          
Guidance  
Best practice – The licensee should ensure, on a case-by-case basis, that all workers who absent 
themselves from initial training to any significant extent are evaluated in order to ensure adequate 
October 2023 
REGDOC-2.2.3, Personnel Certification, Volume III: Certification of Reactor Facility Workers 
 
41 
 
K&S retention prior to their reintegration into an initial training program. However, when the 
absence is shorter than 6 months, formal reintegration is at the licensee’s discretion.

Administrative Policies and Procedures Applicable to Certified Workers  
The policies and procedures specified in this section apply to all certified workers in the context 
of, and in relation to, their employment in the pertinent designated position(s). 
20.1 
Fitness for duty 
The licensee shall implement and document effective fitness-for-duty policies and procedures 
providing the CNSC with reasonable assurance that certified workers are free of any physical or 
mental impairment that could hinder their ability to perform the duties of the pertinent designated 
position(s) safely and competently.  
The fitness-for-duty policies and procedures applicable to certified workers shall be implemented 
consistently with the requirements and guidance specified in this and complementary regulatory 
documents regarding fitness for duty, including those related to the management of worker 
fatigue and the management of alcohol and drug use. 
Guidance 
Complementary regulatory documents – Further requirements and guidance pertaining to the 
management of worker fatigue and the management of alcohol and drug use, including testing, 
can be found in the relevant complementary regulatory documents listed as “Additional 
Information” in the last section of this regulatory document.  
20.2 
Minimum employment of certified workers 
The licensee shall ensure that certified workers are employed in the designated position(s) 
specified on their certificate(s) to the extent necessary to maintain an adequate competency level 
throughout the full duration of their certification. 
20.2.1 Minimum shift requirement for operations personnel 
Certified shift workers shall perform the duties of the pertinent designated position(s) for a 
minimum number acceptable to the CNSC of complete shifts per calendar quarter amounting to a 
minimum number acceptable to the CNSC of hours of shiftwork per calendar quarter. 
Each certified shift worker shall perform the mandated minimum employment as a member of the 
minimum staff complement, as opposed to in any back-up or supernumerary capacity, and, to the 
fullest extent possible, in relation to a fuelled and operating reactor or group of reactors.  
Guidance 
Purpose – The purpose of the minimum employment requirement is to ensure that certified 
workers performing shiftwork are exposed to the duties of the pertinent designated position at a 
sufficient frequency to maintain an adequate competency level. This minimum employment is 
primarily aimed at those routine tasks that are neither safety-significant nor time-sensitive, and 
that may therefore be performed while on duty without negatively impacting nuclear safety. 
October 2023 
REGDOC-2.2.3, Personnel Certification, Volume III: Certification of Reactor Facility Workers 
 
42 
 
Safety-significant or time-sensitive K&S should be systematically covered during continuing 
training.  
Minimum requirement – The licensee is not obligated to ensure that every single shift worked by 
certified shift workers meets the requirements and guidance specified in this subsection, as long 
as each certified shift worker is sufficiently employed so as to meet the applicable minimum 
employment requirement on a quarterly basis.      
Compliance scheme – Appendix B specifies the minimum shift requirements acceptable to the 
CNSC for the pertinent reactor facilities in service at the time of publication of the current version 
of this regulatory document. 
Complete shift – A complete shift means a minimum of 4 consecutive hours of work in a 
designated position as an operator or shift supervisor that is preceded by a formal turnover of the 
responsibilities for the shift with an outgoing counterpart and that is concluded by an equal 
turnover with an incoming counterpart.  
Normal shift duration – The CNSC acknowledges that the licensee may implement, either as the 
norm or to manage work schedules on an individual basis, varied but equally effective shift 
rotations and durations, including, but not limited to, a normal shift duration of 12 hours. 
Minimum shift duration – Considering the known concerns and existing limits related to worker 
fatigue, the CNSC will not define a minimum shift duration other than the aforementioned 
minimum duration of 4 consecutive hours. This minimum duration is specified merely to ensure 
that each complete shift recorded for the purpose of meeting a minimum shift requirement 
provides meaningful exposure to the duties of the pertinent designated position.  
Reasonable accommodation – In order to provide the licensee with sufficient flexibility to 
manage individual circumstances, including, but not limited to, workers suffering from chronic 
illnesses or pain, certified shift workers are free to perform complete shifts of any acceptable 
minimum duration as long as the applicable minimum number of complete shifts and total hours 
of shiftwork are met on a quarterly basis.  
Senior shift supervisors – Once duly qualified, senior shift supervisors are permitted to perform 
the duties of any applicable site-specific shift supervisor position listed in Appendix A, and may 
therefore stand shifts in either or both the shift supervisor and the senior shift supervisor positions 
interchangeably in order to meet an applicable quarterly minimum shift requirement. 
20.2.2 Minimum shift requirement deferment 
When a certified shift worker fails to meet, during any given calendar quarter, an applicable 
minimum shift requirement, the omitted number of complete shifts and hours of shiftwork shall 
be performed in the following calendar quarter, in addition to the minimum shift requirement 
strictly applicable to said calendar quarter.    
20.2.3 Minimum employment of senior health physicists 
The licensee shall ensure that workers certified for employment as an SHP regularly perform the 
duties of an SHP throughout the full duration of their certification. 
October 2023 
REGDOC-2.2.3, Personnel Certification, Volume III: Certification of Reactor Facility Workers

20.3 
Management of prolonged unemployment 
Any certified worker shall be formally removed from the duties of the pertinent designated 
position and assigned an inactive employment status who, for a period lasting 6 consecutive 
months or more, regardless of the rationale, is or will be unable to: 
a. attend the scheduled continuing training  
b. meet an applicable quarterly minimum shift requirement  
Guidance  
Applicability – This subsection applies to any certified worker who meets one or both of the 
prolonged unemployment criteria regardless of the circumstances. Relevant circumstances 
encompass, but are not limited to, any competing work assignment, including a temporary or 
permanent reassignment inside or outside the reactor facility, and any prolonged leave of absence, 
including sabbatical, medical, parental, and maternity leave. In addition, any worker holding a 
valid certificate who ceases to attend continuing training or meet the applicable minimum 
employment requirement, be it voluntarily or not, including due to a planned retirement, should 
likewise be formally removed from duty in accordance with this subsection and may be reinstated 
to duty in accordance with the baseline reinstatement process specified in subsection 20.5, as the 
situation later dictates.          
20.4 
Removal from duty for cause 
Any certified worker who meets any one of the criteria specified in this subsection shall be 
formally removed from the duties of the pertinent designated position for cause and assigned 
either an inactive or uncertified employment status as applicable.  
20.4.1 Failure to meet a minimum employment requirement  
The worker has failed to meet an applicable quarterly minimum shift requirement for 
2 consecutive calendar quarters. 
Guidance 
Applicability – This criterion applies to a certified shift worker who was expected to meet an 
applicable minimum shift requirement and has already failed to meet said requirement for 
2 consecutive calendar quarters. Workers who are unable to perform sufficient shiftwork due to a 
prolonged absence or a competing work assignment should be managed under the prolonged 
unemployment provisions specified in subsection 20.3.       
20.4.2 Requalification test failure 
The worker has failed a requalification test, be it in a lead or supporting role. 
20.4.3 Inability to work safely and competently 
The worker was the subject of a verified positive alcohol or drug test administered in accordance 
with the fitness-for-duty program mandated by the CNSC, or is otherwise deemed unfit, by the 
October 2023 
REGDOC-2.2.3, Personnel Certification, Volume III: Certification of Reactor Facility Workers 
 
44 
 
licensee, to perform the duties of a designated position safely and competently for any reason, 
including, but not limited to: 
a. a medical or physical condition, be it permanent or temporary  
b. a mental health condition, be it permanent or temporary 
c. inadequate performance while on duty, including any action or decision that puts at risk the 
health and safety of workers, the public or the environment 
d. a demonstrated unwillingness or failure to take the necessary precautions to protect the health 
and safety of workers, the public or the environment 
e. a demonstrated lack of integrity or trustworthiness   
Guidance  
Applicability – In regard to any medical, physical, or mental health condition, the removal from 
duty criterion applies to the case of a certified worker who must be removed from duty by the 
licensee, with or without the worker’s consent, because the resulting physical, physiological, or 
mental impediment interferes with the worker’s ability to perform the duties of the pertinent 
designated position safely and competently, regardless of the expected duration of the condition.  
20.4.4 Certificate expiry 
The certificate of the worker has expired. 
20.4.5 Proposed decision not to certify or to decertify 
The worker was identified by the CNSC as the worker concerned in a proposed decision not to 
certify, or a proposed decision to decertify, while a final decision by the Commission or a DO 
remains pending.   
Guidance 
Rationale for removal – In accordance with section 11, both the worker and the licensee have 
30 calendar days to request an opportunity to be heard. When, in addition to this minimum time 
frame, an opportunity to be heard is requested, the final decision by the Commission or a DO may 
be significantly delayed. Since the worker remains certified throughout the whole of the 
proceedings, while the Commission or a DO has reason to decertify or refuse to certify the 
worker, the worker is to be removed from the duties of the pertinent designated position until the 
Commission or a DO has reached a final decision.          
20.5 
Baseline reinstatement process 
No certified worker who has been formally removed from the duties of a designated position shall 
be allowed to perform said duties until the worker has successfully undergone a suitable baseline 
reinstatement process compliant with the requirements specified in this subsection.   
Guidance 
Applicability – The baseline reinstatement process applies to all certified workers removed from 
duty, regardless of the rationale. The remediation process specified in subsection 20.6 is in 
October 2023 
REGDOC-2.2.3, Personnel Certification, Volume III: Certification of Reactor Facility Workers

worker failed to attend while the worker was formally removed from the duty. 
20.5.3 Simulator-based training 
For operations personnel, the worker must have successfully completed suitable simulator-based 
training covering a number and variety of scenarios commensurate with the duration of the period 
of absence or removal from duty of the worker. 
At a minimum, this simulator-based training shall challenge the diagnostic and decision-making 
skills of the worker and encompass any scheduled simulator-based training that the worker failed 
to attend during the period of absence or removal from duty. 
20.5.4 Work under supervision 
For operations personnel, the worker must have successfully performed the duties of the pertinent 
designated position under the supervision of a qualified worker certified for employment in the 
same designated position, and for a number of complete shifts deemed sufficient by the licensee 
to confirm that the worker can perform said duties competently and safely. 
20.5.5 Management interview 
When removed from duty for cause, the worker must have successfully undergone a formal 
management interview. 
October 2023 
REGDOC-2.2.3, Personnel Certification, Volume III: Certification of Reactor Facility Workers 
 
46 
 
Guidance 
Applicability – The management interview is not mandatory for workers being reinstated to duty 
after a period of prolonged unemployment. 
20.6 
Remediation following removal from duty for cause 
In addition to the baseline reinstatement process specified in subsection 20.5, no certified worker 
who has been removed from duty for cause based on one of the criteria defined in subsection 20.4 
shall be allowed to perform the duties of the pertinent designated position until the worker has 
successfully undergone suitable remediation consistent with the applicable cause for the removal, 
as further specified in this subsection.  
20.6.1 Failure to meet a minimum employment requirement  
The licensee may reinstate a worker to the duties of the pertinent designated position following a 
failure to meet a minimum employment requirement, if: 
a. the circumstances that prevented the worker from performing the duties of the pertinent 
designated position no longer exist 
b. the worker has performed, under the supervision of a qualified worker certified for 
employment in the pertinent designated position, a number of complete shifts and hours of 
shiftwork no less than the minimum number of complete shifts and hours of shiftwork that 
the worker failed to complete in the quarter preceding the removal from duty   
20.6.2 Requalification test failure 
The licensee may reinstate a worker to the duties of the pertinent designated position following a 
requalification test failure once the worker has successfully completed a remedial requalification 
test equivalent to the failed requalification test.  
This remedial requalification test shall be equivalent in all respects, but must not be the same as 
the failed requalification test or any other remedial requalification test the candidate may have 
failed as part of the reinstatement process. Furthermore, any restrictions set in complementary 
documents regarding the allowed topic overlap between requalification tests shall apply.   
20.6.3 Inability to work safely and competently 
The licensee may reinstate a worker to the duties of the pertinent designated position following a 
removal from duty due to an inability to work safely and competently if the basis for the removal 
from duty has been adequately remedied or mitigated or no longer exists.         
20.6.4 Certificate expiry 
The licensee may reinstate a worker to the duties of the pertinent designated position following a 
certificate expiry if and when officially informed of the Commission’s or DO’s decision to 
recertify the worker.

relation to a personnel certification scheme or an alternate authorization process, and which must 
therefore be staffed with workers duly certified or authorized by the CNSC.  
(modified) 
full-scope simulator 
A simulator that can perform detailed modelling of the response, under normal, abnormal, and design-
basis accident conditions, of the reactor or group of reactors and associated systems and subsystems 
installed in a reactor facility. A full-scope simulator is equipped with a replica of the main control room 
instrumentation and allows users to monitor and operate in real time the simulated systems and 
subsystems in an environment duplicating the physical and functional characteristics of the 
instrumentation normally available to operations personnel.  
(new) 
individual training needs analysis

gap in the knowledge, skills, and safety-related attributes required of the worker to safely and 
competently perform their duties.          
(new) 
individual training plan 
The learning strategy, including learning objectives and learner evaluation(s), resulting from an 
individual training needs analysis, and serving as basis for the training of an individual learner, as 
opposed to a group of learners.     
(new) 
knowledge-based (learner evaluation, certification examination, requalification test) 
Said of an evaluation designed to measure the retention of job-related knowledge by means of an oral 
or written question-and-answer methodology.   
(modified) 
learner evaluation (see also trainee evaluation) 
The assessment of progress made by participants during an instructional program (formative 
evaluation) and of their achievement at the end of the program (summative evaluation). 
(new) 
performance-based (learner evaluation, certification examination, requalification test) 
Said of an evaluation of job-related knowledge, skills and safety-related attributes based on the direct 
observation of the performance of a job-related task or series of tasks.   
(new) 
senior shift supervisor  
A certified shift supervisor who exercises authority over any number of shift supervisors as an integral 
part of the management system and minimum staff complement; for example, shift managers employed 
at multi-unit CANDU reactor facilities are considered senior shift supervisors.  
(new)
