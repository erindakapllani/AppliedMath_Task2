Preface 
This regulatory document is part of the CNSC’s human performance management series of regulatory 
documents, which also covers human factors, personnel training and personnel certification. The full list 
of regulatory document series is included at the end of this document and can also be found on the 
CNSC’s website. 
Regulatory document REGDOC-2.2.4, Fitness for Duty, Volume II: Managing Alcohol and Drug Use, 
sets out requirements and guidance for managing fitness for duty of workers in relation to alcohol and 
drug use and abuse at all high-security sites, as defined in the Nuclear Security Regulations.  
REGDOC-2.2.4, Fitness for Duty, Volume II is intended to form part of the licensing basis for a regulated 
facility or activity within the scope of the document. It is intended for inclusion in licences as either part 
of the conditions and safety and control measures in a licence, or as part of the safety and control 
measures to be described in a licence application and the documents needed to support that application.  
The CNSC’s regulatory framework includes CNSC regulatory documents as well as national and 
international standards. Specifically, the Canadian Standards Association (CSA Group) N-series standards 
provide an interlinked set of regulatory requirements for the management of nuclear facilities and 
activities. The CSA N286 standard provides an overall management framework and direction to develop 
and implement sound management practices and controls for the licensing basis. This regulatory 
document does not duplicate the generic requirements of CSA N286. However, it provides more specific 
direction for those requirements. 
For proposed new regulated facilities and activities, this document will be used to assess licence 
applications. 
Guidance contained in this document exists to inform the applicant, to elaborate further on requirements 
or to provide direction to licensees and applicants on how to meet requirements. It also provides more 
information about how CNSC staff evaluate specific problems or data during their review of licence 
applications. Licensees are expected to review and consider guidance; should they choose not to follow it, 
they should explain how their chosen alternate approach meets regulatory requirements. 
For existing facilities: The requirements contained in this document do not apply unless they have been 
included, in whole or in part, in the licence or licensing basis. 
A graded approach, commensurate with risk, may be defined and used when applying the requirements 
and guidance contained in this regulatory document. The use of a graded approach is not a relaxation of 
requirements. With a graded approach, the application of requirements is commensurate with the risks 
and particular characteristics of the facility or activity.  
For information on the implementation of regulatory documents and on the graded approach, see 
REGDOC-3.5.3, Regulatory Fundamentals. 
Important note: Where referenced in a licence either directly or indirectly (such as through licensee- 
referenced documents), this document is part of the licensing basis for a regulated facility or activity. 
The licensing basis sets the boundary conditions for acceptable performance at a regulated facility or 
activity, and establishes the basis for the CNSC’s compliance program for that regulated facility or 
activity.

Fitness for Duty, Volume II: Managing Alcohol and Drug Use 
1. 
Introduction 
1.1 
Purpose 
This regulatory document establishes requirements and guidance for managing worker fitness for 
duty with respect to alcohol and drug use. 
1.2 
Scope 
This regulatory document is intended for high-security sites as defined in the Nuclear Security 
Regulations. The requirements and guidance in this document apply to workers holding safety- 
critical or safety-sensitive positions as described in section 4.1. 
1.3 
Relevant legislation 
The following provisions of the Nuclear Safety and Control Act (NSCA) and the regulations 
made under it are relevant to this document: 
 
Subparagraph 9(a)(i) of the NSCA states that one of the objects of the Commission is “to 
regulate the development, production and use of nuclear energy and the production, 
possession and use of nuclear substances, prescribed equipment and prescribed information in 
order to prevent unreasonable risk, to the environment and to the health and safety of persons, 
associated with that development, production, possession or use”. 
 
Paragraph 12(1)(a) of the General Nuclear Safety and Control Regulations requires that 
every licensee shall “ensure the presence of a sufficient number of qualified workers to carry 
on the licensed activity safely and in accordance with the Act, the regulations made under the 
Act and the licence”. 
 
Paragraph 12(1)(b) of the General Nuclear Safety and Control Regulations requires that 
every licensee shall “train the workers to carry on the licensed activity in accordance with the 
Act, the regulations made under the Act and the licence”. 
 
Paragraph 17(b) of the General Nuclear Safety and Control Regulations requires that every 
worker shall “comply with the measures established by the licensee to protect the 
environment and the health and safety of persons, maintain security, control the levels and 
doses of radiation, and control releases of radioactive nuclear substances and hazardous 
substances into the environment”. 
 
Subparagraph 17(c)(i) of the General Nuclear Safety and Control Regulations requires that 
every worker shall “promptly inform the licensee or the worker’s supervisor of any situation 
in which the worker believes there may be a significant increase in the risk to the 
environment or the health and safety of persons”. 
 
Paragraph 17(e) of the General Nuclear Safety and Control Regulations requires that every 
worker shall “take all reasonable precautions to ensure the worker’s own safety, the safety of 
the other persons at the site of the licensed activity, the protection of the environment, the 
protection of the public and the maintenance of the security of nuclear facilities and of 
nuclear substances”. 
 
Paragraph 3(d.1) of the Class I Nuclear Facilities Regulations requires that an application for 
a licence to operate a Class I nuclear facility shall contain “the proposed human performance 
program for the activity to be licensed, including measures to ensure workers’ fitness for 
duty”. 
January 2021 
REGDOC-2.2.4, Fitness for Duty, Volume II: Managing Alcohol and Drug Use, Version 3

 
Paragraph 6(d) of the Class I Nuclear Facilities Regulations stipulates that an application for 
a licence to operate a Class I nuclear facility shall contain “the proposed measures, policies, 
methods and procedures for operating and maintaining the nuclear facility”. 
 
Section 18.4 of the Nuclear Security Regulations states that “an authorization referred to in 
section 18 may be issued for any term not exceeding five years and shall be subject to any 
terms and conditions necessary to minimize the risk to the security of the facility.” 
 
Section 38 of the Nuclear Security Regulations requires that “every licensee shall develop a 
supervisory awareness program and implement it on an ongoing basis to ensure that its 
supervisors are trained to recognize behavioural changes in all personnel, including 
contractors that could pose a risk to security at a facility at which it carries on licensed 
activities.” 
 
1.4 
Relevant international standards and guidelines 
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has identified the need for nuclear 
facilities to address fitness for duty. The IAEA’s framework that supports fitness for duty 
is embedded in two safety requirement documents [1, 2] and in numerous safety 
guides [3 to 6]. 
For all nuclear facilities, the IAEA recommends that regulators inspect licensees’ fitness-
for-duty programs and evaluate their effectiveness [3]. Regulators are also to ensure 
nuclear facility operators have “guidelines on fitness for duty in relation to hours of work, 
health, and substance abuse” [4]. 
With respect to drugs and alcohol, the IAEA recommends that all nuclear facilities have 
guidelines on fitness for duty related to substance use [5]. The IAEA further recommends 
that licensees have methods for identifying those with a tendency toward alcohol or drug 
abuse, and that administrative controls be established to allow the fitness for duty of shift 
personnel to be observed, verified and controlled. As well, the IAEA also advises that 
“personnel prone to drug or alcohol abuse should not be employed for safety related 
tasks” [6]. 
2. 
Background 
Human performance is a key contributor to the safety and security of nuclear facilities. One factor 
that affects human performance is fitness for duty. The adoption of measures that monitor alcohol 
and drug use or abuse is a key component of ensuring worker fitness for duty. For the purposes of 
this document, fitness for duty is defined as: 
A condition in which workers are physically, physiologically, and 
psychologically capable of competently and safely performing their 
tasks. 
The implementation of an effective fitness-for-duty program relating to alcohol and drug use and 
abuse provides reasonable assurance that workers have the capacity, and are free of impairment 
that could hinder their ability, to competently and safely perform the duties of their position, and 
as such do not pose a safety or security risk. 
January 2021 
REGDOC-2.2.4, Fitness for Duty, Volume II: Managing Alcohol and Drug Use, Version 3

The fitness-for-duty requirements herein in relation to alcohol and drug use and abuse represent 
reasonable occupational and operational requirements for the applicable worker population. An 
employer is responsible for assessing the extent, where considered necessary, of the duty to 
accommodate. In fulfilling the duty to accommodate, an employer is required to accommodate a 
worker whose need(s) are based on any of the grounds of discrimination in the Canadian Human 
Rights Act – for example, someone identified with a disability – to the point where 
accommodation would cause undue hardship for the employer [7]. The licensee is also 
responsible for ensuring that any duties assigned to a worker do not pose a risk to his or her 
health or safety, the health or safety of others, the safety of the facility and the environment, and 
do not impact the effectiveness of the licensee’s operation. 
3. 
Managing Alcohol and Drug Use 
With respect to alcohol and drug use and abuse, licensees shall manage the fitness for duty of 
applicable workers (see section 4.1) who could pose a risk to nuclear safety or security in 
accordance with their management system as defined in the licensee’s licensing basis. The 
following subsections specify how the management system’s generic requirements apply to 
managing fitness for duty in relation to alcohol and drug use and abuse. 
3.1 
Policy statements 
Licensees shall establish, implement and maintain clear fitness-for-duty policy statements 
regarding alcohol and drug use and abuse. The policy statements shall provide workers with 
information on what is expected of them and the consequences that may result from policy 
violations. 
Guidance 
Licensees’ alcohol- and drug-related policy statements should: 
1. prohibit reporting to work or remaining at work under the influence of alcohol, cannabis, 
cannabis-derived products, or illicit drugs;  
2. prohibit bringing, keeping or consuming alcohol, cannabis, cannabis-derived products, illicit 
drugs, drug paraphernalia or prescribed medications without a legal prescription on the 
grounds of the high-security site; 
3. reinforce the responsible use of prescription or over-the-counter medications, or 
mood-altering substances, and the process to follow if a worker uses medication that impairs 
or has the potential to impair his or her ability to competently and safely perform his or her 
duties; 
4. describe the responsibilities of workers, supervisors, oversight personnel and escorts to report 
fitness-for-duty concerns in relation to alcohol and drug use and abuse; 
5. describe the expectations regarding the reasonable length of time that workers should abstain 
from the use of alcohol and/or drugs prior to reporting to work, with due consideration of 
longer-term impairing effects. 
3.2 
Fitness-for-duty program 
With respect to alcohol and drug use and abuse, a licensee shall implement a documented 
fitness-for-duty program that includes a set of coordinated measures designed to provide 
reasonable assurance that applicable workers (see section 4.1) are capable of performing their 
tasks and as such do not pose a risk to their safety, the safety of others, or the safety or security of 
January 2021 
REGDOC-2.2.4, Fitness for Duty, Volume II: Managing Alcohol and Drug Use, Version 3 
 
4 
 
the facility. Note: In implementing the fitness-for-duty program, licensees are required to 
consider all relevant privacy-related legislation. 
3.3 
Authorities, accountabilities and responsibilities 
With respect to alcohol and drug use and abuse, licensees shall define and document the 
authorities, accountabilities, and responsibilities for those involved with managing worker fitness 
for duty including the interfaces with external organizations. 
Guidance 
With respect to alcohol and drug use and abuse, licensees should define and document the 
authorities, accountabilities, and responsibilities of the following, if applicable: 
 senior management 
 supervisors, oversight personnel and escorts 
 workers 
 security personnel 
 human resources 
 fitness-for-duty program administrators 
 duly qualified health professionals 
 duly qualified forensic toxicologists 
 duly qualified pharmacists 
 breath alcohol technicians 
 specimen collectors 
 medical review officers (MROs) 
 accredited laboratories 
 third-party providers 
 employee assistance program (EAP) providers 
 substance abuse evaluation providers 
3.4 
General fitness-for-duty process 
Licensees shall establish, implement and maintain a process to identify and manage applicable 
workers who have temporary or ongoing limitations that may make them incapable of performing 
their assigned duties competently and safely due to alcohol or drug use or abuse. This process 
shall include actions for a supervisor to take if he or she believes – through self-reporting, peer 
reporting, observed behaviour, physical condition, a fitness-for-duty screening or assessment, a 
health professional’s report or after receiving credible information – that a worker may be unable 
to competently and safely perform his or her assigned duties because of alcohol or drug use or 
abuse. 
Licensees shall establish, implement and maintain a referral process to guide workers to seek 
assistance from the appropriate resources. 
Guidance 
The fitness-for-duty process may include both self-referrals and directed referrals to appropriate 
fitness-for-duty resources, such as health professionals, employee assistance program provider or 
January 2021 
REGDOC-2.2.4, Fitness for Duty, Volume II: Managing Alcohol and Drug Use, Version 3 
 
5 
 
testing program through the fitness-for duty administrator. Processes should identify the 
conditions that warrant for-cause assessments. 
Prior to a mandatory referral based on observed behaviour, a fitness-for-duty screening should be 
conducted. The screening should be based on face-to-face interaction between the worker, a 
supervisor and at least one other person. A screening checklist should be used. 
3.5 
Access to assistance 
Licensees shall ensure that applicable workers have access to an EAP. EAPs shall be designed to 
achieve early intervention and provide confidential assistance. 
Guidance 
The EAP should offer confidential assessment, short-term counselling, referral services and 
treatment monitoring to workers who have problems, including alcohol or drug use or abuse that 
could adversely affect their ability to competently and safely perform their duties. 
3.6 
Behavioural observation 
Licensees shall ensure that applicable workers are subject to behavioural observation, specifically 
related to alcohol or drug use or abuse. 
3.6.1 
Peer observation and reporting 
Licensees shall ensure that expectations regarding peer observation and reporting are included in 
their fitness-for-duty processes and aligned with their respective policy statements on peer 
observation for potential alcohol or drug use or abuse issues. 
3.6.2 
Supervisory awareness program 
As indicated in section 1.3 of this document, section 38 of the Nuclear Security Regulations 
requires licensees to develop a supervisory awareness program. This is to ensure that supervisors 
are trained to recognize behavioural changes in all personnel, including contractors that could 
pose a risk to security at a facility. 
Supervisory awareness training shall be delivered to supervisors and other designated personnel 
identified by the licensee. 
Guidance 
Observations related to a worker’s fitness for duty related to alcohol or drug use or abuse should 
be made in a variety of situations, such as during task assignments, observation and coaching 
sessions, field inspections, pre-job briefings, performance reviews, one-on-one sessions, shift 
turnovers and incident investigations. 
 
Aberrant behaviour and incidents related to alcohol and drug use and abuse should be 
documented and trended to facilitate appropriate intervention strategies based on risk. 
January 2021 
REGDOC-2.2.4, Fitness for Duty, Volume II: Managing Alcohol and Drug Use, Version 3 
 
6 
 
Supervisory awareness training may include the following aspects: 
 
knowledge of the authorities, accountabilities, and responsibilities of supervisors and other 
designated personnel with respect to behavioural observation 
 
knowledge of the interfaces between related fitness-for-duty policies, procedures, and 
supporting programs 
 
the ability to recognize behaviours that may indicate the possible use, sale, or possession of 
illegal drugs; use or possession of alcohol or impairment from prescription and 
over-the-counter medication onsite or while on duty 
Further information on observed behaviours can be found in section 5.2. 
3.7 
Assessment and continual improvement 
An assessment of the fitness-for-duty program related to alcohol and drug use and abuse and the 
supervisory awareness program shall be performed periodically to identify opportunities for 
continual improvement and to confirm the program’s effectiveness. 
 
Licensees shall carry out trend analyses of problems and causes related to the use and abuse of 
alcohol and drugs. 
3.8 
Training, education, and awareness 
Licensees shall ensure that those with authorities, accountabilities, and responsibilities for 
monitoring alcohol and drug use and abuse, including workers, receive initial and continuing 
training commensurate with their authorities, accountabilities and responsibilities. 
 
Guidance 
With respect to alcohol and drug use and abuse, licensees’ training, education and awareness for 
workers who are subject to the fitness-for-duty program should include the following aspects: 
 
knowledge of the fitness-for-duty policy statements and procedures that apply to the worker, 
the methods that will be used to implement them, and the consequences of violating the 
policy and procedures 
 
knowledge of the individual’s authorities, accountabilities, and responsibilities under the 
fitness-for-duty program 
 
knowledge of the EAP and other support or assessment services available to the worker 
 
knowledge of the health and safety hazards associated with abuse of illegal and legal drugs 
and alcohol 
 
knowledge of the potential adverse effects of alcohol, and prescription and over-the-counter 
drugs on job performance 
 
the ability to recognize behaviours in peers that may indicate the possible use, sale or 
possession of illegal drugs; use or possession of alcohol or impairment from prescription and 
over-the-counter medication on site or while on duty 
 
knowledge of the individual’s responsibility to report a fitness-for-duty concern and the 
ability to initiate appropriate actions related to self- and peer-reporting 
Additional requirements and guidance related to training can be found in sections 3.6.2, 6.1, 6.2 
and 6.5.

5. 
Alcohol and Drug-Testing Requirements by Circumstance and Workgroup 
Alcohol and drug testing of workers holding safety-critical or safety-sensitive positions shall be 
conducted in accordance with the breath alcohol-testing and drug-testing processes described in 
sections 6.1 to 6.6. The testing circumstances relevant to the prescribed workgroups are 
summarized in table A.1 of appendix A. 
5.1 
Pre-placement alcohol and drug testing 
Licensees shall require all candidates who succeed in progressing through all the previous stages 
of a job competition to a safety-critical position (see section 4.1, bullets 1 and 2) to submit to 
alcohol and drug testing as a condition of placement. Incumbent workers transferring into a 
safety-critical position (see section 4.1, bullets 1 and 2) shall also be required to submit to a 
pre-placement alcohol and drug test. 
Guidance 
As job applicants are not workers, a substance test should not be used as a screening tool and 
should only be administered once a candidate has met all other qualifications necessary.

5.2 
Reasonable grounds alcohol and drug testing 
Licensees shall require all workers in safety-critical or safety-sensitive positions (see section 4.1, 
bullets 1–5) to submit to for-cause testing under the reasonable grounds testing circumstance. 
Licensees shall define within their fitness-for-duty governance documents when workers in 
safety- critical or safety-sensitive positions will be required to submit to for-cause reasonable 
grounds testing. 
Under for-cause reasonable grounds testing, workers in safety-critical or safety-sensitive 
positions (see section 4.1, bullets 1–5) shall be required to submit to for-cause reasonable grounds 
testing when there is reasonable cause to believe, through observed behaviour, physical condition 
or after receiving credible information, that the individual is unfit to perform his or her duties, due 
to the adverse effects of alcohol or drug use. The grounds for for-cause reasonable grounds 
testing shall be independently verified by at least two people (one of whom is a supervisor). 
Guidance 
Observed behaviours and physical conditions that may establish for-cause reasonable grounds 
testing include: 
 breath odour 
 observed use or possession of alcohol, illicit drugs, or drug paraphernalia 
 speech patterns 
 physical appearance and behaviour 
 an episode or events that suggest irrational or reckless behaviour 
Further information on supervisory awareness is found in section 3.6.2. 
5.3 
Post-incident alcohol and drug testing 
Licensees shall require all workers in safety-critical or safety-sensitive positions (see section 4.1 
bullets 1–5) to submit to for-cause testing under the post-incident testing circumstance. 
Under post-incident testing, workers in safety-critical or safety-sensitive positions (section 4.1 
bullets 1–5) shall be required to submit to for-cause testing as soon as practicable after a 
significant incident where a human act or omission by the worker may have caused or contributed 
to the event. 
Guidance 
In deciding whether or not to conduct post-incident testing, it is not necessary to determine if 
alcohol or drugs were contributing factors to the significant incident. 
Significant incidents refer to a subset of incidents that have safety significance (see Glossary for 
definitions of “incident” and “safety significance”).

5.4 
Follow-up and return-to-duty alcohol and drug testing 
Licensees shall require all workers in safety critical or safety-sensitive positions (see section 4.1, 
bullets 1–5) to submit to follow-up testing after confirmation of a substance use disorder by a health 
professional, and return-to-duty testing as part of the reinstatement process. 
Workers shall be subject to follow-up alcohol and drug testing in an unannounced and random 
fashion at a minimum of every 3 months for a minimum period of 2 years. At the discretion of the 
health care professional, additional testing beyond these minimum requirements may be 
conducted to ensure abstinence. 
Licensees shall, as part of the reinstatement process to a safety-critical or safety-sensitive 
position, require workers identified with a substance use disorder to be tested prior to returning to 
and on assuming safety-sensitive duties. The worker must have a negative drug test result and/or 
an alcohol test with an alcohol concentration below 20 mg/100mL before resuming performance 
of safety-sensitive duties. 
5.5 
Random alcohol and drug testing 
Licensees shall require all workers holding safety-critical positions (see section 4.1, bullets 1 and 
2) to submit to random alcohol and drug testing. Licensees’ sampling process used to select these 
workers for random testing shall ensure that the number of random tests performed at least every 
12 months is equal to at least 25 percent of the applicable worker population. 
Licensees shall develop procedures and practices to ensure that random testing is administered in 
a manner that provides reasonable assurance that individuals are unable to predict when 
specimens will be collected. 
The following shall be addressed for the implementation and conduct of random testing: 
1. Ensure that all individuals in the population subject to testing have an equal probability of 
being selected and tested. 
2. Require that individuals who are offsite when selected for testing, or who are onsite and are 
not reasonably available for testing when selected, be tested at the earliest reasonable 
opportunity when both the donor and specimen collectors are available to collect specimens 
for testing and without prior notification to the individual that he or she has been selected for 
testing. 
3. Provide that an individual completing a test is immediately eligible for another unannounced 
test. 
Guidance 
The following should be considered for the implementation and conduct of random testing: 
 
Collect specimens on an unpredictable schedule, including weekends, night shifts and 
holidays, and at various times during a shift. 
 
Have testing administered by the fitness-for-duty program on a nominal weekly frequency. 
 
Require individuals who are selected for random testing to report to the collection site as 
soon as reasonably practicable after notification, within the time period specified in the 
fitness-for- duty program policy. 
 
Establish, implement and maintain alcohol- and drug-testing processes.

Alcohol- and Drug-Testing Processes 
6.1 
Breath alcohol-testing process 
Licensees shall establish, implement and maintain a process to test workers holding safety-critical 
and safety-sensitive positions for the presence of alcohol. 
Licensees shall retain or maintain competency in the administration, collection, and analysis of 
evidential breath alcohol testing. The qualified technicians conducting the breath alcohol testing 
shall be independent from workgroups subject to testing. For licensee-maintained processes, 
licensees shall establish, implement, and maintain procedures for the administration of evidential 
breath alcohol testing. For retained services, licensees shall ensure service providers maintain 
procedures for the administration of evidential breath alcohol testing. 
Licensees shall ensure that an evidential breath testing instrument is used that has been evaluated, 
tested and recommended by the Alcohol Test Committee (a committee under the auspices of 
Canada’s Department of Justice) as an approved instrument published in the Approved Breath 
Analysis Instruments Order (SI/85-201) [11]. 
Licensees shall ensure that the following blood alcohol concentrations (BACs) are used for the 
determination of positive breath alcohol test results: 
1. A BAC below 20 mg/100mL shall be considered a negative test, and no further action is 
required. 
2. A BAC from 20 to 39 mg/100mL shall be considered an action level. The licensees shall 
prohibit the worker from performing safety-sensitive duties until a determination of fitness 
indicates that the worker is fit to competently and safely perform his or her duties. 
3. A BAC of 40 mg/100mL or greater shall be considered a positive test and a fitness-for-duty 
policy violation (see section 6.3). 
Table B.1 in appendix B provides a summary of BAC ranges and associated actions [12]. 
Guidance 
Licensees should refer to the Alcohol Test Committee when establishing procedures for the 
administration of evidential breath alcohol testing, including: 
 the initial and continuing training and qualification of breath alcohol technicians for the 
operation of approved instruments, including conversion training 
 the initial and continuing training and qualification of designated service personnel for the 
preventative and corrective maintenance of approved instruments 
 the development and implementation of protocol(s) for: 
o maintaining approved instruments authorized for use at the nuclear site 
o the preparation required prior to conducting alcohol testing 
o handling and processing workers that will be tested, including escort procedures 
o conducting an initial alcohol test using a breath specimen 
o conducting a confirmatory test for alcohol (when the initial test is 20 mg/100mL or 
greater) 
o determining a confirmed positive breath alcohol test result 
o shy lung 
o documenting and reporting requirements of breath alcohol specimens 
January 2021 
REGDOC-2.2.4, Fitness for Duty, Volume II: Managing Alcohol and Drug Use, Version 3

6.2 
Drug-testing process 
Licensees shall establish, implement and maintain a process to test workers holding safety-critical 
and safety-sensitive positions for the presence of drugs. In meeting this requirement, licensees 
may choose to use either laboratory urine drug testing or laboratory oral fluid drug testing, or a 
combination of both. 
Licensees shall develop, implement, and maintain procedures for the administration of drug 
testing including the collection, storage, and transportation of specimens to a designated 
accredited laboratory. Licensees shall retain or maintain competency in the collection, storage and 
transportation of specimens, and shall ensure that specimen collectors are independent from 
workgroups subject to testing. 
Licensees shall retain and utilize the services of an accredited laboratory to analyze and report the 
results of urine or oral fluid drug specimens. For urine drug testing, licensees shall use a 
laboratory accredited by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration 0 F    
(SAMHSA)1. For oral fluid drug testing, licensees shall use a laboratory accredited by SAMHSA 
or a laboratory that meets ISO/IEC 17025, General Requirements for the Competence of Testing 
and Calibration Laboratories [14]. 
For each drug class, licensees shall document in their governance whether urine or oral fluid test 
results will be used to determine a policy violation. Licensees shall direct the accredited 
laboratory to report positive test results in conjunction with the urine or oral fluid drug panel 
(initial and confirmatory cut-off thresholds) as established in appendix B (see tables B.2 and B.3 
for urine and tables B.5 and B.6 for oral fluid). 
Licensees shall develop, implement, and maintain a procedure for reviewing and verifying 
positive, adulterated or invalid drug test results from a medical, toxicological or pharmacological 
perspective. The procedure shall ensure that a medical review officer (MRO) is designated to 
review, interpret and verify the laboratory test results for each drug class as specified in the urine 
and oral fluid drug panels [13, 15] in appendix B. 
Licensees shall direct the accredited laboratory to report all positive, adulterated or invalid test 
results directly to the MRO conducting the drug test review. 
In determining whether the donor has violated the fitness-for-duty policy, licensees shall direct 
the MRO to: 
1. provide the donor an opportunity to explain any alternative reasons for the positive test result 
2. only report verified positive test results to the licensee 
Licensees shall direct the MRO to raise any for-cause mandatory referrals for other 
fitness-for-duty assessments, as necessary, to ensure safety and security.  
                                                     
 
 
1 Effective May 12, 1998, the Standards Council of Canada (SCC) voted to end its laboratory accreditation 
program and adopt United States Department of Transportation regulations for the conduct of forensic 
urine drug testing. The SCC program was formerly known as the Laboratory Accreditation Program for 
Substance Abuse (LAPSA). 
January 2021 
REGDOC-2.2.4, Fitness for Duty, Volume II: Managing Alcohol and Drug Use, Version 3 
 
12 
 
Guidance 
Procedures for the administration of drug-testing collection and transportation of specimens 
should include or make reference to the following: 
 
licensee-approved collection kits, containers, and other supplies for specimen collection 
 
protocol for chain of custody, including relevant forms 
 
protocol for urine and oral fluid specimen collection, including collector duties, specific 
collection site requirements, verification of donor identity, and potential collection errors 
(recoverable and non-recoverable) 
 
protocols for handling and processing workers that will be tested, including escort 
procedures 
 
protocol for verification and assurance of sample integrity, including tampering and 
adulteration 
 
protocols for urine and oral fluid specimen storage and security 
 
protocols for urine and oral fluid specimen packaging and transportation to a designated 
accredited laboratory 
 
licensee-approved shipment containers 
 
protocols for shy bladder and dry mouth 
 
protocol for refusal to test 
 
initial and continuing training and qualification of urine and oral fluid specimen collectors 
 
Licensees should retain and utilize the services of a third-party provider, where feasible, for the 
administration, collection, verification and assurance of specimen integrity and chain of custody, 
and shipment of specimens to an accredited laboratory. 
Licensees should consider adopting a dilution protocol for urine samples and should consider 
testing samples identified as dilute against the urine drug panel (initial and confirmatory cut-off 
thresholds) established in table B.4 [13] of appendix B. 
Licensees should direct the MRO to consult with duly qualified toxicologists, duly qualified 
pharmacists, or other specialists as required when reviewing, interpreting, and verifying test 
results. In the event that the MRO determines that there is a legitimate medical explanation for 
the positive drug test – such as legitimate use of prescription drugs, or a medical condition – the 
positive test should not be considered verified. However, a fitness-for-duty assessment may be 
required to determine if the worker is fit for duty. 
6.2.1 
Point of collection testing 
Requirements and guidance contained above in section 6.2 also apply to point of collection 
testing (POCT), where appropriate. 
Licensees may choose to utilize POCT as a screening tool (following up with additional testing 
only for non-negative results) or to assess the risk of having a worker return to safety-sensitive or 
safety-critical duties pending the MRO’s report on the urine- or oral-fluid-based laboratory test.  
If licensees choose to utilize POCT, a protocol shall be established and documented. 
Non-negative results shall be verified by laboratory immunoassay screening and confirmation 
testing.  
January 2021 
REGDOC-2.2.4, Fitness for Duty, Volume II: Managing Alcohol and Drug Use, Version 3 
 
13 
 
For a minimum of 5% of negative POCT tests, licensees shall compare negative POCT results 
with laboratory-based results on the same type of biological sample (urine or oral fluid), for 
quality assurance purposes.  
Licensees who decide to conduct POCT shall select devices that are: 
1. certified by Health Canada or independently evaluated by qualified laboratory personnel on 
an initial and annual basis to ensure that the devices meet forensic standards such as 
specificity, sensitivity and efficiency 
2. calibrated to the extent possible (±25%) with the urine or oral fluid drug testing cut-offs 
established in appendix B (see table B.2 for urine immunoassay or table B.5 for oral fluid 
immunoassay cut-offs) 
If licensees choose to utilize POCT, POCT devices shall be used only in random or post-incident 
testing circumstances. POCT devices shall not be used in pre-placement, reasonable grounds, 
follow-up or return to duty testing circumstances. 
Guidance 
For the minimum 5% of negative POCT tests used to assess quality assurance, a second sample 
from the same person should be collected, labelled only with a quality assurance sample 
identifier, and sent to the laboratory for testing. The laboratory test results should be used to 
evaluate the performance of the POCT device and the collection techniques of the collector. As a 
good practice, all collectors and all sites should be evaluated every quarter. 
6.3 
Process for positive alcohol and drug tests 
Workers who provide a verified positive alcohol or drug test shall be removed from safety-critical 
or safety-sensitive duties and referred for a mandatory substance abuse evaluation. 
The licensee shall not consider the worker for reinstatement to safety-critical or safety-sensitive 
duties until a recommendation for reinstatement has been received from a duly qualified health 
professional. 
6.4 
Substance abuse evaluation process 
Licensees shall establish, implement and maintain an assessment process to evaluate workers in 
safety-critical or safety-sensitive positions for a substance use disorder. Licensees shall identify 
the conditions under which a substance abuse evaluation is required, including a verified positive 
alcohol or drug test. 
Licensees shall ensure that both licit and illicit drugs are addressed. 
The substance abuse evaluation shall be conducted by a duly qualified health professional. Duly 
qualified health professionals shall be certified by a professional association that includes 
substance abuse evaluation or shall have received training in substance abuse evaluation and be 
affiliated with a provincial college of physicians or nurses. 
Workers assessed as having a substance use disorder shall not return to safety-critical or 
safety-sensitive duties until they have met conditions for reinstatement, as recommended by the 
duly qualified health professional. 
January 2021 
REGDOC-2.2.4, Fitness for Duty, Volume II: Managing Alcohol and Drug Use, Version 3 
 
14 
 
Guidance 
The assessment process should include consideration of the following aspects: 
 
organizational and procedural interfaces between internal and external stakeholders with 
defined roles in the management of substance dependency, such as the duly qualified health 
professionals, supervisors and oversight personnel, and external third-party providers 
 reporting to the designated fitness-for-duty program administrator 
 referral to the licensee’s designated substance testing facility 
In determining the duly qualified health professional’s qualifications, licensees may consider the 
following or equivalent certifying bodies as listed below: 
 Canadian Addiction Counsellors Certification Federation 
 Canadian Society for Addiction Medicine 
 Canadian Counselling and Psychotherapy Association 
 Association of Cooperative Counselling Therapists of Canada 
 Canadian Professional Counsellors Association 
 Indigenous Certification Board of Canada 
 Canadian Council of Professional Certification 
Substance use disorders may also be diagnosed through medical or psychological assessments. 
Licensees should consider adopting relapse agreements with workers assessed as having a 
substance use disorder. 
6.5 
Investigative and alcohol and drug screening tools 
Licensees shall establish and document the accepted use of investigative and alcohol and drug 
screening tools included in their respective fitness-for-duty programs. Use of these tools shall be 
clearly documented, and training programs shall be provided to support the designated personnel 
in the proper use of the tools. 
Guidance 
Licensees may consider the adoption of the following investigative and alcohol and drug 
screening tools: 
 fitness-for-duty assessment screening checklist for supervisors 
 fitness-for-duty self-assessment screening checklist for workers 
 passive alcohol screening devices 
 drug detection dogs and devices (for example, ion scanners) 
 physical searches
