Preface 
Industrial radiography is regulated by the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC). It is a 
non-destructive testing method that uses high-activity sealed radioactive sources to examine the structure 
of welds, castings and building components, in order to identify flaws and errors or to ensure that work in 
an area will not affect hidden existing systems, such as pipes and electrical wires. The advantages of 
using exposure devices for non-destructive testing are that they are highly portable, require no external 
power sources, and can be used in various field settings. 
Regulatory document REGDOC -2.5.7, Design, Testing and Performance of Exposure Devices, Version 
1.1 provides guidance in the design, testing and performance of exposure devices, in order to apply for the 
certification of the radiation device under section 12 of the NSRD Regulations. Persons applying for 
certification of such devices must thoroughly demonstrate that the exposure device and related 
accessories are designed to operate in a safe manner. 
The CNSC and the international community recognize industrial radiography as a high-risk activity, due 
to its widespread use of sealed radioactive sources and the potential of these sources to immediately 
deliver high doses of radiation. 
The Nuclear Substances and Radiation Devices Regulations (NSRD Regulations) require that exposure 
devices, which include related accessories, and any other radiation device be certified by the CNSC 
before they can be used in Canada. This certification is not to be construed as a licence for use or 
servicing. The equipment used for industrial radiography must be certified by the CNSC before it can be 
licensed by the CNSC for use in Canada. 
This document does not deal with the transport of the exposure devices, or the certification of exposure 
device operators and their obligations when using exposure devices. Transport requirements are set out in 
the Packaging and Transport of Nuclear Substances Regulations. Certification of exposure device 
operators and their obligations when operating the device are set out in the NSRD Regulations. 
This regulatory document largely refers to the established International Organization for Standardization 
(ISO) standard, Radiation protection – Apparatus for industrial gamma radiography – Specifications for 
performance, design and tests, ISO 3999:2004 (E) [1]. 
For information on the implementation of regulatory documents and on the graded approach, see 
REGDOC-3.5.3, Regulatory Fundamentals. 
The words “shall” and “must” are used to express requirements to be satisfied by the licensee or licence 
applicant. “Should” is used to express guidance or that which is advised. “May” is used to express an option or 
that which is advised or permissible within the limits of this regulatory document. “Can” is used to express 
possibility or capability. 
Nothing contained in this document is to be construed as relieving any licensee from any other pertinent 
requirements. It is the licensee’s responsibility to identify and comply with all applicable regulations and licence 
conditions.

REGDOC-2.5.7, Design, Testing and Performance of Exposure Devices 
1. 
Introduction 
1.1 
Purpose 
This document provides guidance for the design, testing and performance of exposure devices 
containing radioactive sealed sources, and related accessories to those devices. 
1.2 
Scope 
This document covers design, testing and performance specifications for the complete exposure 
device system, including the remote-control system, the exposure device, the projection sheath 
and the source changer. The use of non-original manufacturer accessories is also addressed. 
This document does not deal with the transport of the exposure devices, or the certification of 
exposure device operators and their obligations when using exposure devices. Transport 
requirements are set out in the Packaging and Transport of Nuclear Substances Regulations, 
2015. Certification of exposure device operators and their obligations when operating the device 
are set out in the Nuclear Substances and Radiation Device Regulations. 
1.3 
Relevant legislation 
The Nuclear Substances and Radiation Device Regulations relevant to this document include: 
1. section 1, which defines the terms “exposure device”, “radiation device”, “sealed source”, 
and “sealed source assembly” 
2. subsections 11(1) and 11(2), which state: 
a. no person shall use a radiation device unless 
i. 
it is a certified model; or 
ii. it is used in accordance with a licence that authorizes its use for development 
purposes. 
b. no person shall transfer a radiation device for use within Canada unless it is a certified 
model. 
3. subsection 12(1), which lists the information required in an application before certification of 
an radiation device may be granted 
4. subsection 12(2), which states “The Commission or the designated officer may request any 
other information that is necessary...”  
5. section 18, which outlines leak test requirements 
The Radiation Protection Regulations relevant to this document include: 
1. subsection 20(1), which outlines the labelling requirements for radiation devices. 
1.4 
National and international standards 
The review of an application for certification of an exposure device is based on the International 
Organization for Standardization (ISO) standard ISO 3999:2004 (E), Radiation protection – 
Apparatus for industrial gamma radiography – Specifications for performance, design and tests 
[1]. Throughout this document, all references to “the ISO standard” mean ISO 3999:2004 (E).

Nothing contained in this document is to be construed as relieving any applicant from the 
requirements of any pertinent regulations. It is the applicant’s responsibility to identify and 
comply with all applicable legislation and standards. 
2. 
Application Review Criteria 
In order to assess an application for the certification of an exposure device design, this section 
describes the type of information that the CNSC requires which is different from the requirements 
outlined in ISO 3999:2004 (E). 
2.1 
Explanation of terms 
The following terms apply throughout this document: 
1. “ISO standard” means the international standard ISO 3999:2004 (E) 
2. Where applicable, the common industry term is given (in brackets) 
3. The term “apparatus for industrial gamma radiography” is described in the above ISO 
standard. However, in this document it is replaced by the term “exposure device,” as defined 
in the NSRD Regulations 
4. An accessory to an exposure device is considered to be any equipment used in conjunction 
with an exposure container and that drives, guides, or comes into contact with the sealed 
source assembly. Accessories to the device include: 
a. source assembly 
b. remote control – which includes the control cable sheath, control cable connector, control 
adaptor and the control mechanism 
c. projection sheath (guide tube) 
d. exposure head (source stop) 
e. beam limiter (collimator) – when designed as an integral part of an exposure head (Note: 
Beam limiters designed to be secured over the exposure head are not considered an 
accessory to the device and therefore do not require certification) 
f. source changer 
2.2 
Baseline specifications in the ISO standard 
The design of the exposure device should be in accordance with the as low as reasonably 
achievable (ALARA) principle. The application should describe the design options for the 
exposure device, as well as the results of the ALARA evaluation of these design options, leading 
to the selection of the design submitted for certification. The application should include an 
evaluation of the estimated radiation doses associated with the final design, and the key factors 
determining its choice. 
2.3 
Changes to ISO standard requirements 
The following recommendations supplement sub-clauses in ISO 3999:2004 (E), in order to meet 
CNSC requirements. 
2.3.1 
General design 
The ISO standard requires the design of the exposure device to operate over the temperature 
range of –10 ººC to 45 ºC. However, in order to meet the demands of the Canadian climate, the 
device should operate satisfactorily over the broader temperature range of –40 ºC to 45 ºC. 
September 2020 
REGDOC-2.5.7, Design, Testing and Performance of Exposure Devices, Version 1.1 
 
 
3 
 
2.3.2 
Sealed sources 
The ISO standard requires that the radioactive sealed source be in compliance with 
ISO 2919:2012, Radiological protection – Sealed radioactive sources – General requirements 
and classification [2]. Compliance with ANSI/HPS N43.6-2007, Sealed Radioactive Sources– 
Classification [3] is also acceptable for radiation device certification by the CNSC. 
2.3.3 
Safety devices – Operation of the automatic securing mechanism 
The ISO standard does not address exposure devices that employ a shutter for shielding the sealed 
source assembly in the secured position. In such cases, the shutter should have a securing 
mechanism that automatically secures it in the shielded position each time the sealed source 
assembly is returned from the exposing position to the fully shielded position. It should be 
possible to release the shutter only by means of an intentional operation on the exposure device or 
remote control. 
The securing mechanism should not operate in a manner that prevents the source from returning 
to the shielded position. 
2.3.4 
Calibration and maintenance of radiation survey meters 
The requirements for the radiation survey meter to be properly calibrated and functional shall be 
in accordance with the current version of the IEC 60846-1, Radiation protection instrumentation 
– Ambient and/or directional dose equivalent (rate) meters and/or monitors for beta, X and 
gamma radiation – Part 1: Portable workplace and environmental meters and monitors [4] or an 
equivalent standard. 
2.3.5 
Resistance to normal conditions of service 
2.3.5.1 General 
Unless the exposure device and its accessories have already passed identical tests or more 
stringent tests under other standards, they should undergo the tests described in the ISO standard. 
Production exposure devices should be equivalent to the tested unit. 
The reference to IAEA-STI-PUB 998 in the ISO standard should be replaced with the IAEA 
Specific Safety Requirements No. SSR-6 Rev. 1, Regulations for the Safe Transport of 
Radioactive Material (2018 Edition) [5], and IAEA Specific Safety Guide No. SSG-26, Advisory 
Material for the IAEA Regulations for the Safe Transport of Radioactive Material (2012 Edition) 
[6]. 
2.3.5.2 Endurance test 
The exposure device should operate normally and the integrity of the cladding or encasement of 
the shielding should not be breached due to wear at the conclusion of the endurance test. The use 
of a borescope, or an equivalent test, should be performed to check any fatigue or wear of the 
S-tube. 
2.3.6 
Vibration-resistance test 
Either the vibration test described in sub-clause 6.4.5 of the ISO standard or that described in 
section 6.2.2 of the ANSI N43.9-1991 American National Standard for Gamma Radiation – 
Specifications for Design and Testing of Apparatus [7] may be used. 
September 2020 
REGDOC-2.5.7, Design, Testing and Performance of Exposure Devices, Version 1.1

2.3.7 
Labelling 
Subsection 20(1) of the Radiation Protection Regulations must be followed regarding the 
labelling of exposure containers and devices. They must be labelled with the basic ionizing 
radiation symbol (see schedule 3 of the Regulations) and the words “RAYONNEMENT – 
DANGER – RADIATION”. The critical components of associated equipment include the 
projection sheath connector, control adaptor, control cable, control cable connector and source 
assembly. Except for the control cable, these components must be durably and legibly marked to 
identify the manufacturer. 
2.3.8 
Accompanying documents – Instructions for use 
In addition to the list in sub-clause 9.3 of the ISO standard, instructions on the conditions and 
limitation of use should also be provided, including environmental conditions (such as 
temperature, pressure, and humidity), chemical environment, and underwater restrictions. 
2.4 
Specifications not addressed in the ISO standard 
The following recommendations are in addition to the ISO standard. 
2.4.1 
Source changer 
Source changers should be designed to ensure that the source will not be accidentally withdrawn 
from the source changers when connecting or disconnecting the drive cable to or from the source 
assembly. Source changers should also be equipped with a locking mechanism designed to 
prevent the unauthorized or accidental removal of the sealed source from its shielded position. 
2.4.2 
Projection sheath 
The projection sheath (guide tube) should be equipped with an exposure head, or be designed for 
an exposure head to be attached. This should prevent the sealed source assembly from passing out 
the end of the projection sheath. 
Note: A beam limiter (collimator) may serve as an exposure head. 
2.5 
Use of non-original accessory equipment 
Accessory equipment or components from a non-original equipment manufacturer may be used, 
provided that the accessory equipment or components meet the following criteria and have been 
certified by the CNSC: 
1. They are identical in size, material specifications, and dimensions as the prototype that has 
been tested according to guidance in this document 
2. They are constructed to the quality assurance requirements as specified in the ISO standard  
3. It is demonstrated through documented prototype testing or analytical means that the non-
original accessories or components meet the design, testing, and performance as outlined in 
this document 
Instead of certifying individual components, the CNSC would only certify the complete accessory 
equipment as one unit for a specific exposure container.

3. 
Certification of an Exposure Device Design 
Once a certificate for an exposure device design has been issued, it only applies to a specific 
exposure container model design as well as to specific operating conditions and accessories. Any 
future changes to the design or use may require a new certification of the radiation device.
