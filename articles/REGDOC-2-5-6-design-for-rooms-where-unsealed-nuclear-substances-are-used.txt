Design of Rooms Where Unsealed Nuclear Substances Are Used 
1. 
Introduction 
1.1 
Purpose 
REGDOC-2.5.6, Design of Rooms Where Unsealed Nuclear Substances Are Used, clarifies 
requirements and provides guidance for licensees who work with unsealed nuclear substances.  
1.2 
Scope 
The document includes information on finishings and fixtures, emergency facilities and general 
contamination control considerations, plumbing, access control, external dose control, waste, 
room ventilation and air flow, ducts, vents and stacks, fume hood design, hot cell design and dose 
estimation for the various room classifications (intermediate-level, high-level, containment-level 
or nuclear medicine). 
This document is intended for the following classes of licences: 
• 
Class II Nuclear Facility and Prescribed Equipment  
• 
Nuclear Substance and Radiation Devices 
However, the information provided may also be useful for other classes of licences. 
1.3 
Relevant legislation 
The following provisions of the Nuclear Safety and Control Act (NSCA) and the regulations 
made under it are relevant to this document: 
• 
NSCA, subsection 24(4) 
• 
General Nuclear Safety and Control Regulations (GNSCR), section 3 and paragraph 12(1)(c) 
• 
Nuclear Substances and Radiation Devices Regulations (NSRDR), paragraph 3(1)(l) 
• 
Radiation Protection Regulations (RPR), subparagraph 4(a)(iii) 
2. 
Licensing process for using unsealed nuclear substances 
As part of the process to obtain a licence for the use of unsealed nuclear substances, applicants 
must submit a completed licence application in accordance with section 3 of the GNSCR, 
section 3 of the NSRDR and section 4 of the RPR. More information about the design of rooms 
being proposed in a licence application can be found in: 
• 
REGDOC-1.4.1, Licence Application Guide: Class II Nuclear Facilities and Prescribed 
Equipment [1]  
• 
REGDOC-1.6.1, Licence Application Guide: Nuclear Substances and Radiation Devices, 
version 2 [2]

If required, a dose estimation must also be submitted. Refer to section 4 of this document for 
information related to dose estimates. 
For ease of application, the CNSC recommends that applicants complete the relevant Design 
Assessment Form (DAF) in Appendix B when applying for any new construction, major 
renovation and/or change to the licensed activities in a room where unsealed nuclear substances 
will be used. DAFs are a tool to assist applicants in gathering the information required, but they 
are not themselves required. Applicants can submit the required information in other forms, 
provided it meets the criteria laid out in this document. For the purposes of this document, 
required design information shall hereafter be referred to as “DAF.” 
In addition, Appendix B provides a summary of requirements and guidance applicable for each 
room classification, which can also be used as a checklist when completing the DAF. For 
example, a DAF should be completed when: 
• 
demolishing walls 
• 
changing existing shielding 
• 
changing the total annual and/or per use activities of nuclear substances  
• 
adding nuclear substances 
• 
installing a new fume hood or making changes to the ventilation systems 
• 
undergoing renovations that change the shielding of the room or the source-receptor distance 
• 
using mobile units (i.e. a temporary and/or movable room where unsealed nuclear substances 
are used) 
The completed DAF should be submitted to the CNSC as early as possible in the design stage in 
order to facilitate the assessment of the licence application or amendment. If multiple rooms of 
similar design and function are to be constructed or renovated, only one DAF needs to be 
submitted. 
Where more than one room for using unsealed nuclear substances is to be constructed or 
renovated, and the designation or use of each one is different, a separate DAF should be 
submitted for each room. CNSC staff may request additional information after the initial design 
or renovation assessment is completed.  
Any modification to a room where unsealed nuclear substances are used may require review if 
changes are made to the initial design. If unsure whether a revised DAF should be submitted, 
licensees should consult their CNSC licensing contact.  
2.1 
Classification of rooms 
Table 1 outlines the classifications of rooms where unsealed nuclear substances are used and their 
respective criteria/descriptions. With the exception of basic-level rooms, all other room 
classifications require the written approval of the Commission or a person authorized by the 
Commission for the use of unsealed nuclear substances. 
All areas, rooms or enclosures where more than one exemption quantity of an unsealed nuclear 
substance is used must be classified as basic, intermediate, high or containment-level rooms,

according to the maximum activity of any nuclear substances to be used in the room at one time 
(see table 1), including all rooms where veterinary nuclear medicine activity is performed.  
Table 2 outlines the nuclear medicine classification in the areas, rooms or enclosures where 
nuclear substances are prepared for or administered to a person. This classification is specific to 
nuclear medicine licence use types issued (for the purposes of diagnostic, therapeutic and human 
research studies). The radiopharmacy located in a nuclear medicine department shall be classified 
as a nuclear medicine room; however, for design purposes, applicants must follow the 
requirements and guidance described for the intermediate, high or containment-level room 
classification, depending on the quantity of unsealed nuclear substances used at a single time. For 
the purpose of this document, nuclear medicine rooms are separated into one of two 
classifications: “nuclear medicine – radiopharmacy” and “nuclear medicine – other.”  
Table 1: Classification of rooms where unsealed nuclear substances are used 
Classification of room 
Criteria/description 
Basic-level  
The quantity of unsealed nuclear substance used at a single time 
does not exceed 5 times its corresponding annual limit on intake 
(≤ 5 ALI). 
Intermediate-level  
The quantity of unsealed nuclear substance used at a single time 
does not exceed 50 times its corresponding ALI (≤ 50 ALI). 
High-level  
The quantity of unsealed nuclear substance used at a single time 
does not exceed 500 times its corresponding ALI (≤ 500 ALI). 
Containment-level  
The quantity of unsealed nuclear substance used at a single time 
exceeds 500 times its corresponding ALI (> 500 ALI). 
 
Table 2: Classification of rooms where unsealed nuclear substances are used for nuclear 
medicine purposes 
Nuclear medicine 
Criteria/description 
Areas, rooms or enclosures where nuclear substances are prepared for or administered to a 
person (via injection, inhalation or ingestion) for the purpose of diagnosis or treatment of 
patients, or for human research studies (excluding medical diagnostic X-rays or the medical 
use of sealed sources for brachytherapy or teletherapy treatments).   
 
Nuclear medicine – 
radiopharmacy 
Follow the guidance and requirements described for the 
intermediate-level (≤ 50 ALI), high-level (≤ 500 ALI) or 
containment-level (> 500 ALI) room classification. 
Nuclear medicine – 
other 
Injection room, imaging room, therapeutic in-patient room or any 
other room routinely occupied by patients undergoing diagnostic 
or therapeutic procedures.

Notes: 
1. The appropriate ALI value is the one that best represents the risks associated with the nuclear 
substance. If it is not possible to determine whether the greater risk is related to the inhalation 
or ingestion of the substance, then the more restrictive value should be used. ALIs may be 
derived using the latest compendium of dose conversion factors (DCFs) published by the 
International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) [3], by dividing 0.02 Sv by the 
DCF (Sv/Bq). For inhalation, the largest DCF for a 5 µm particle size should be used. 
2. Tables 1 and 2 do not apply to rooms or enclosures used solely for storage of nuclear 
substances. In these circumstances applicants should follow the guidance given in section 3.5, 
“External Dose Control.” 
3. In cases where more than one nuclide is used in a room, the room classification should be 
determined separately using each nuclide’s ALI and maximum handled activity. The most 
restrictive room classification result (i.e., highest) should be the level assigned to the room. 
3. 
Design Requirements and Guidance for Sections B to H of the Design Assessment 
Form 
This section outlines requirements and guidance for the design of rooms in which unsealed 
nuclear substances are used. The following requirements and guidance are risk-informed and 
corresponds to sections B to H of the DAF.  
The DAF also provides opportunities to propose alternative means of achieving the intent of the 
requirements outlined in this section. Any alternative approach shall demonstrate that the 
ALARA principle is maintained. 
Basic-level rooms do not require a design assessment and therefore do not require a DAF. 
3.1 
Finishing and fixtures – section B of the design assessment form  
Requirements 
The following applies to rooms classified as intermediate-level, high-level, containment-
level, nuclear medicine – other, and nuclear medicine – radiopharmacy: 
• 
B1 – Use flooring, work surfaces, chairs, cupboards and shelving that have a smooth, impervious 
and washable finish in areas where unsealed nuclear substances are used. 
Guidance for all room classifications 
Containing spills and other accidents is a prime concern in all rooms in which unsealed nuclear 
substances are used. As a result: 
• 
B2 – Flooring should have a 1-piece design. If the flooring is more than 1 piece, all joints in the 
flooring material should be sealed. The joint between the flooring and the walls should be 
rounded to prevent spills from getting underneath them. Flooring should have a strippable coating 
to make decontamination easier, should an accident occur. 
• 
B3 – All joints on work surfaces, including bench tops, should either be sealed or have a seamless 
1-piece design.

• 
B4 – Countertops should include a lip or raised edge to prevent runoff onto the floor. If the 
countertop abuts a wall, the joint should also be rounded or the countertop should have a 
backsplash. 
• 
B5 – Walls should be finished with a smooth and washable surface, and all joints should be 
sealed. This can make cleanup easier if a room is contaminated by back-spray from a vial or if 
some other similar event occurs. 
• 
B6 – The ceiling should be finished with a smooth, washable surface, and all the joints should be 
sealed. Easily replaceable modular ceilings (e.g., drop ceiling with tiles) are also acceptable. 
3.2 
Emergency facilities and general contamination control considerations – section C 
of the design assessment form 
Requirements 
The following applies to all room classifications: 
• 
C1 – Areas for food and drink preparation, consumption or storage are not located inside any 
room in which unsealed nuclear substances are used. 
Note: The only exception to this requirement is where the patient’s consumption of food or 
drink is a necessary part of a nuclear medicine procedure. In such cases, only food and 
beverages intended for patients may be stored in the room, and only patients undergoing such 
studies may consume this food or beverages. 
The following applies to rooms classified as high-level, containment-level and  
nuclear medicine – radiopharmacy: 
• 
C2 – Have personnel decontamination facilities appropriate to the activities and the nuclear 
substances and chemicals used. 
• 
C3 – Have emergency lighting. 
Guidance for all room classifications 
• 
C4 – An accessible area should be designated to store materials and equipment used for 
decontamination and monitoring. Materials and equipment should include spill kits, survey 
meters and contamination meters appropriate for the nuclear substances and chemicals being 
used. 
• 
C5 – Decontamination facilities should include a separate hand-washing sink near the 
entrance to the room. 
• 
C6 – An emergency eye-wash station and an emergency shower should be located in or near 
the room. 
• 
C7 – Personal contamination monitoring equipment suitable for the nuclear substances being 
used should be available at all points of entry/exit. 
• 
C8 – Amenities like coat hooks, active laundry bins, storage lockers, etc., should be provided 
in the room near the entrance. This can facilitate the removal and proper storage of 
potentially contaminated personal protective equipment, such as lab coats, before leaving the 
room. 
Guidance specific to nuclear medicine – other

• 
C9 – Nuclear medicine departments should have washrooms dedicated for use by patients 
undergoing nuclear medicine procedures. 
• 
C10 – Due to the potential for contamination, if patients need to stay at the hospital after the 
radioisotope is administered, they should stay in a room with a classification as set out in 
table 2. 
 
3.3 
Plumbing – section D of the design assessment form 
The use of municipal sewage systems for the disposal of unsealed nuclear substances is not 
normally a recommended practice. However, sinks or other sanitary facilities may be necessary 
for non-radioactive processes, or in the case of nuclear medicine, patient hygiene. 
Requirements 
The following applies to rooms classified as intermediate-level rooms, high-level rooms, 
containment-level rooms and nuclear medicine–radiopharmacy rooms: 
• 
D1 – Where routine releases occur via the sewer, or where the potential for accidental 
releases exists, licensees SHALL have mechanisms in place to ensure that these releases are 
ALARA and meet applicable clearance levels.  
Requirement specific to therapeutic nuclear medicine in-patient rooms (nuclear medicine – 
other) 
• 
D2 – Each in-patient room shall have its own dedicated washroom. 
Guidance for all room classifications 
Sinks 
• 
D3 – Sinks should be made of material that is readily decontaminated. 
• 
D4 – Each sink should have an overflow outlet. 
Faucets 
• 
D5 – Faucets should be operable by a means that does not require direct hand contact. 
• 
D6 – Faucets with vacuum or cooling line attachments should include backflow protection 
devices. 
Drains 
• 
D7 – Drains should be constructed of a corrosion-resistant material suitable for the chemicals 
used in the room. 
• 
D8 – Drains and sink traps that may contain transient quantities of nuclear substances must be 
marked accordingly and be clearly identified on any plans provided to maintenance personnel 
or contractors.

3.4 
Access control – section E of the Design Assessment Form 
Requirements  
The following applies to all room classifications : 
• 
E1 – Have an access control system (key, keypad, key fob, other) in place to ensure that only 
authorized workers can enter the restricted room. 
• 
E2 –Ensure that rooms that give access to nuclear substances have lockable doors. 
• 
E3 – Have a secondary lockable storage area (refrigerator, freezer, cupboard) for rooms that 
are shared with workers who are not authorized to use nuclear substances.  The secondary 
storage container must be secured such that it cannot be easily removed from the room. 
• 
E4 – Have clearly delineated designated areas where unsealed nuclear substances are used 
when an area in the room is also to be used for other types of work.  
• 
E5 – Ensure that any accessible windows are secure to prevent unauthorized access to the 
room. 
3.5 
External dose control – section F of the design assessment form 
Requirements 
The following applies to rooms classified as high-level, containment-level,  
nuclear medicine – other, and nuclear medicine – radiopharmacy: 
• 
F1 – Applicants shall include the dose estimates to nuclear energy workers (NEWs) and non-
NEWs in the proposed room and adjacent areas. 
Guidance for all room classifications 
If the initial dose estimates yield annual doses below 50 µSv per year for members of the public, 
and doses to NEWs are unlikely to exceed 1 mSv per year, no further optimization is necessary. 
Where optimization is necessary, social and economic factors should be considered. Extensive 
guidance on estimating doses is provided in appendix A. 
• 
F2 – Shielding should be used in areas where nuclear substances are to be used or stored. The 
extent of shielding depends on the quantities of nuclear substances that emit penetrating 
radiation. It may be necessary to reinforce surfaces to bear the weight of any shielding 
material required. 
• 
F3 – When appropriate, shielding should be incorporated into the structure of the room. 
• 
F4 – To minimize the movement of nuclear substances, areas between which nuclear 
substances are to be moved should be located as close to each other as operationally possible. 
Guidance specific to nuclear medicine-other  
• 
F5 – A separate waiting room should be available for patients to whom nuclear substances are 
administered. 
• 
F6 – The in-patient room used for therapeutic purposes should not be adjacent to another 
occupied room; preferably, it should be located at the end of the hall and have the fewest 
shared walls possible.

3.6 
Waste – section G of the design assessment form 
Guidance for intermediate level, high-level, containment-level and nuclear medicine – 
radiopharmacy rooms 
• 
G1 – Adequate space should be available for radioactive waste generated by work within the 
area where unsealed nuclear substances are used. This space may be in the classified room or 
in a separate dedicated storage area for radioactive waste. 
• 
G2 – Potential doses to persons occupying adjacent areas should be addressed explicitly as 
part of the shielding and dose assessment. 
• 
G3 – Storage areas that contain volatile nuclear substances should be connected to the 
dedicated ventilation system. 
3.7 
Room ventilation and air flow – section H of the design assessment form 
The requirements and guidance in this section only apply to rooms where volatile, aerosolized or 
gaseous nuclear substances are used. 
Typically, dedicated ventilation systems consist of a suitably designed fume hood or hot cell and 
have an exhaust system with sufficient air flow to prevent backflow into the room. Hot cells are 
heavily shielded enclosures for processing radioactive material. They can be used to control risks 
from both radiation exposure and contamination. 
Requirements 
The following applies to rooms classified as high-level, containment-level and nuclear 
medicine – radiopharmacy: 
• 
H1 – Ensure that air flow is always from areas of lower concentrations of volatile, 
aerosolized or gaseous nuclear substances to areas of higher concentrations, except when any 
contaminated air is taken to a dedicated ventilation system. 
• 
H2 – Ensure that fume hoods or hot cells, including exhaust fans, are supported by automatic 
backup or emergency power.  
• 
H3 – Ensure that fume hoods are not the sole means of room air exhaust. If this is 
unavoidable, a bypass shall be installed to ensure ventilation when the sash is closed. 
• 
H4 – Ensure that air exhausts for fume hoods or hot cells are only connected to the dedicated 
ventilation system in such a way that airborne radioactivity cannot recirculate to unclassified 
areas. 
• 
H5 – Provide detailed information about all filtration used, including filtration monitoring, 
shielding and filter exchange. 
Guidance for intermediate-level, high-level, containment-level and nuclear medicine – 
radiopharmacy rooms 
• 
H6 – Each fume hood or hot cell should have an alarm, either visual or audible, to indicate 
reduced air flow. 
• 
H7 – Exhaust systems for fume hoods or hot cells should incorporate filtration, gas storage 
decay tanks or other measures appropriate to the activities and types of nuclear substances 
used, to eliminate or minimize releases to the environment. 
• 
H8 – The minimum face velocity of the fume hood should be higher than the velocity of air 
currents in the room to prevent any airborne radioactivity from escaping the fume hood. 
May 2023 
REGDOC-2.5.6, Design of Rooms Where Unsealed Nuclear Substances Are Used 
 
 
9 
 
 
• 
H9 – The energy saving systems of automatic fume hoods (automatic flow reduction 
according to a programmed schedule) should include a local override function in the event 
that the fume hood needs to be used after hours. 
• 
H10 – No additional means of ventilation (portable filtration system or fan) should interfere 
with the performance of the fume hood or hot cell. 
• 
H11 – Fume hoods or hot cells should be located away from air currents or turbulence, such 
as high traffic areas, doors, operable windows and air supply (vents, windows, etc.). 
• 
H12 – Fume hoods or hot cells should not be adjacent to the exit of the room due to the 
possible volatility of contents. 
• 
H13 – Supply air vents should be installed or directed away from fume hoods to avoid 
interference. 
3.8 
Ducts, vents and stacks – section I of the design assessment form 
The requirements and guidance in this section only apply to rooms where volatile, aerosolized or 
gaseous nuclear substances will be used. 
Two general methods exist for controlling releases to the environment:  
• 
Containment: Examples include automatic compression systems to compress and store air 
from fume hoods or hot cells for decay, and gas hold up systems to store such air for decay. 
This is only suitable for short lived nuclear substances.  
• 
Atmospheric dispersion: The principal design parameters for adequate dispersion are the 
discharge height above ground and the stack velocity, which increases the effective height of 
the discharge. Filters (accessible for maintenance and shielded) can also be incorporated into 
the stack; certain chemicals including many volatile iodine compounds are readily trapped by 
activated carbon or charcoal. 
Requirements 
The following applies to rooms classified as high-level, containment-level and nuclear 
medicine – radiopharmacy : 
• 
I1 – Ensure that all ductwork is constructed of corrosion-resistant materials appropriate for 
the nuclear substances used in the fume hood or hot cell. 
• 
I2 – Ensure that all connections and joints are sufficiently sealed to prevent nuclear 
substances from leaking into adjacent air spaces. 
• 
I3 – Clearly identify nuclear exhaust ducts on both the ducts themselves and any plans 
provided to maintenance personnel or contractors. 
• 
I4 – Demonstrate via atmospheric dispersion modelling or other calculations, including 
calculations set out in REGDOC-2.9.1, Environmental Principles, Assessments and 
Protection Measures [4], that doses to the public arising from both routine releases and 
foreseeable worst-case scenarios are ALARA and will not exceed the applicable dose limits. 
Guidance for high-level rooms, containment-level rooms and nuclear medicine – 
radiopharmacy rooms 
• 
I5 – Rain caps on stacks should not be used because they limit vertical dispersion. 
• 
I6 – Stack velocity should be at least 1.5 times the average wind velocity to avoid entrapping 
any radioactive releases on the downwind side of the stack. [5] 
May 2023 
REGDOC-2.5.6, Design of Rooms Where Unsealed Nuclear Substances Are Used 
 
 
10 
 
 
• 
I7 – Stack velocity should be more than 5 m/s to reduce the amount of rain falling in; ~90% 
of rainwater falls in drops with a velocity less than this. [10,11] 
• 
I8 – Ensure that the stack height is at least 3.0 m above the highest point on any adjacent 
roofline. It should be above head height so that there is no risk that anyone will lean over the 
stack. 
• 
I9 – Locate exhaust stacks or vents on the roof as far away as possible and downwind from 
the prevailing wind direction to prevent recirculating the nuclear substances being released. 
• 
I10 – Post a cautionary sign and contact information where the stack is located on the roof. 
3.9 
Fume hood design – section J of the design assessment form 
The requirements and guidance in this section only apply to rooms where volatile, aerosolized or 
gaseous nuclear substances will be used. 
Requirements 
The following applies to rooms classified as high-level, containment-level and  
nuclear medicine – radiopharmacy : 
• 
J1 – Have fume hoods which are constructed of smooth, impervious, washable and chemical-
resistant material. 
• 
J2 – Have fume hoods that are designed to contain spills so that they cannot readily spread 
beyond their interior surfaces. 
• 
J3 – Select fume hoods based on adequacy for the intended work. 
Guidance for high-level rooms, containment-level rooms and  
nuclear medicine – radiopharmacy rooms  
• 
J4 – The interior of the fume hood should have rounded corners for easy decontamination and 
cleanup. 
• 
J5 – Fume hoods should be labelled to show the connection to a specific fan or ventilation 
system. 
3.10 
Hot cell design – section K of the design assessment form 
Requirements 
The following applies to rooms classified as containment-level and nuclear medicine – 
radiopharmacy (> 500 ALI) : 
• 
K1 – Have hot cells constructed of smooth, impervious, washable and chemical-resistant 
material. 
• 
K2 – Have hot cells designed to contain spills so that they cannot readily spread beyond their 
interior surfaces. 
• 
K3 – Select hot cells based on adequacy for the intended work. 
• 
K4 – Have hot cells equipped with manipulators for remotely handling objects inside the hot 
cell.

• 
K5 – Hot cells should have a means of transferring radioactivity in and out safely. For 
example, radioactive solutions may be pumped into the back of the hot cell via transfer lines 
from an accelerator producing nuclear substances. Once the radioactive material has been 
processed, it should be placed in a shielded container to be transferred out of the hot cell, 
usually through a drawer on the side of the hot cell. 
• 
K6 – The lid of the shielded container should be securely attached to the body of the shielded 
container while it is still inside the hot cell. Shielding should be placed between any 
unprocessed radioactivity and the hands of the person removing the shielded container from 
the hot cell. 
• 
K7 – Hot cells should have a window to allow the visual observation of processes inside the 
hot cell. The window should have a level of shielding equivalent to that of the hot cell walls. 
In modern hot cells, windows are usually constructed of lead glass. 
• 
K8- Radiation monitors should be installed inside hot cells.  This is especially important for 
protecting staff who may have to open the hot cell in order to install, modify or repair 
equipment inside.

Dose estimates for rooms classified as high-level, containment-level, nuclear 
medicine – other and nuclear medicine – radiopharmacy 
The submission of dose estimates is required for these types of room classification. The same 
approach may be followed as described in Appendix A: Estimating Doses. 
For rooms classified as high-level, containment-level, nuclear medicine – other and nuclear 
medicine – radiopharmacy, doses shall also be considered at the planning stage. In this case, 
localized shielding is typically used to ensure that the dose rates in the surrounding areas are 
acceptable.  
The main sources of radiation and the shielding materials shall be considered, and the resulting 
dose rates shall be provided (by measurement or by calculation) to the CNSC. For applicants 
having dual-modality devices, it is best practice to include the doses from X-rays in their 
calculations. 
Occupancy by persons in adjacent or nearby areas shall be considered and the resulting annual 
doses determined. The intended use of procedural and work practice controls should also be 
considered and included in the application. 
The ALARA principle shall be considered when designing any areas, rooms or enclosures where 
nuclear substances will be used. At the planning and design stage, the impact that design 
decisions will have on potential doses to persons (excluding the patient) shall be a prime 
consideration. With nuclear medicine, this is especially important given that the source, once 
administered to a person, will not be in a fixed location. 
The assessment of applications with respect to any nuclear medicine room shall include a review 
of the dose estimates for persons (excluding the patient) in the area, including persons in adjacent 
rooms. Appendix A provides guidance and sample calculations, which in most cases should be 
supported with room layout schematics, on how to determine and demonstrate that radiation dose 
estimates are ALARA prior to building the room and carrying out any licensed activities. 
REGDOC-2.7.1, Radiation Protection [6], provides guidance on keeping doses ALARA.

Appendix A: Estimating Doses 
This appendix provides one method for estimating the radiation doses in a nuclear medicine department. 
The same approach can be used to estimate radiation doses for other classifications of rooms (high-level 
and containment-level) where unsealed nuclear substances are used. The calculations below are simplified 
examples that yield conservative results. For example, patient self-attenuation factors, the attenuation of 
standard construction material (e.g., drywall, wall studs) and source decay have not been considered. 
Applicants are free to use these or other reasonable, defensible mitigating factors in their dose 
calculations. 
The following table presents the characteristics of the main categories of nuclear medicine procedures: 
conventional diagnostic nuclear medicine, positron emission tomography (PET) and therapeutic nuclear 
medicine. For the purpose of estimating annual doses, the primary difference between these categories 
lies in the nuclear substances and activities used and/or the location and duration of treatment.

General framework for dose estimation 
Doses from nuclear medicine procedures can be estimated in a number of ways. All methods are 
extensions of the basic radiation safety principles of time, distance and shielding. Each method requires 
an initial review of: 
• 
the nuclear substances and activities to be used for the nuclear medicine procedures performed 
• 
the locations at which these nuclear substances and activities will be used (including patient-occupied 
bathrooms and waiting rooms) 
• 
the annual number of procedures to be performed

REGDOC-2.5.6, Design of Rooms Where Unsealed Nuclear Substances Are Used

• 
the occupancy of the rooms in the nuclear medicine department and all adjacent areas by staff, 
patients and the general public 
• 
the layout of the facility 
• 
the construction materials used to construct the facility 
Accurate dose estimate representation is contingent on the proper characterization of the operation and 
design of the facility. 
Five-step method for radiation dose estimation 
The overall approach to radiation dose estimation can be broken down into the following five steps: 
Step (1) Facility layout 
Obtain architectural drawings or make an accurate, scaled and dimensioned drawing of the facility and 
surrounding areas. The drawings need to show the locations where significant quantities of nuclear 
substances will be present. They will also show occupied locations where persons might be exposed to 
radiation as a result of licensed activity. If available, scaled architectural drawings are ideal for this 
purpose. 
Identify the locations where nuclear substances are to be used. This includes rooms where nuclear 
substances will be administered to the patient and the main post-administration locations. 
Figure A1 shows a hypothetical nuclear medicine department layout, with dimensions and basic shielding 
details. Letters A to E2 identify the locations with the greatest potential for exposure. The same method 
used to estimate radiation dose to these areas can be used for other areas, such as designated waiting 
areas, reception areas, changing rooms or washrooms. 
Step (2) Estimating workload 
The workload needs to be identified for each key location. Workload refers to the number of procedures 
per year, as well as the typical activity (MBq) per procedure. 
For any given nuclear medicine facility, several different gamma-emitting nuclear substances may be 
used regularly and be present at a number of locations within the facility (e.g., Ga-67, Ra-223, Sr-89, Lu-
177, Tc-99m, In-111, I-123, I-131 and Tl-201). Most of these nuclear substances emit several gamma rays 
of different energies which are attenuated to varying degrees in any shielding material. 
Initially, all possible procedures are considered. If it can be demonstrated that some procedures are 
insignificant to the total doses incurred, the doses from such procedures may not require detailed 
estimates. 
This can be determined by multiplying the typical activity for a procedure by the number of annual 
procedures of that type and by exposure duration per procedure. 
Example: 
For illustrative purposes, assume that the nuclear medicine department shown in figure A1 primarily 
performs three types of outpatient diagnostic procedures: cardiac imaging, bone scan and thyroid uptake. 
The typical daily workload and details of the nuclear substances and activities used are presented in table

A2. The annual number of procedures performed is estimated from the daily workload by assuming five 
days of operation per week (no procedures are done on the weekends), 50 weeks per year.

From this, it is clear that the radiation doses incurred by staff or the general public as a result of thyroid 
uptake procedures are likely to be negligible in comparison with cardiac analyses or bone scans and can 
be omitted from the dose estimation. 
Step (3) Estimating occupancy factor 
Identify the purpose, type of occupancy and occupancy factor of those areas within or in the immediate 
vicinity of the nuclear medicine department that will be occupied while nuclear substances are in use. 
These are the areas in which staff and the general public (other than the patient) would be expected to 
receive a radiation dose as a consequence of the nuclear medicine activities. For each area, determine: 
• 
what the area is used for (e.g., reception desk, waiting room, radiopharmaceutical injection rooms, 
gamma camera room, washroom) 
• 
who is normally present in the area (e.g., staff who are NEWs, non-NEWs performing work or 
members of the general public, such as persons accompanying patients or hospital staff performing 
work unrelated to the licensed activity) 
• 
the occupancy factor (T) for each location and exposed group (e.g., the fraction of time a person 
spends in an area during which a radiation field is present) 
The occupancy factor (T) should be determined for each location and exposed group (i.e., the fraction of 
total time during which a radiation field may be present at a particular location, for which another 
individual may be present at that location). When evaluating T, an important consideration is whether or 
not a person may be at the location of interest while there is a radiation field present in that area. For 
example, a technologist will be in many different locations throughout the course of a normal workday, 
but will always be in close proximity to the patient when injecting radiopharmaceuticals or while setting 
them up on the scanner bed. Conversely, cleaning staff may only be in the nuclear medicine department 
after normal operating hours, and consequently, may be exposed to little or no radiation despite spending 
appreciable lengths of time in the department. 
For additional information, refer to the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements 
(NCRP) Report No. 151: Structural Shielding Design and Evaluation for Megavoltage X- and 
Gamma-Ray Radiotherapy Facilities [7].

REGDOC-2.5.6, Design of Rooms Where Unsealed Nuclear Substances Are Used

The determination of occupancy is probably the most difficult aspect of the dose assessment. To begin, 
you must first determine who (other than the patient) is exposed to radiation as a consequence of the 
operation of the nuclear medicine department. For nuclear medicine operations, these persons are 
normally divided into three categories: NEWs, non-NEWs and members of the public (including staff 
performing work unrelated to the licensed activity). 
Generally, when calculating dose estimates, nuclear medicine technologists, radiologists and any other 
technical staff working in the department will be identified as NEWs. 
Non-NEWs are staff members performing work related to the licensed activity with annual doses below 
1 mSv.  
Members of the public generally fall into three very broad groups: 
• 
persons accompanying patients undergoing nuclear medicine scans 
• 
persons who may be present in adjacent corridors or rooms, including pedestrians outside the 
building, patients in adjacent areas of the building (e.g., the outpatient clinic) and persons occupying 
areas above and below the department 
• 
non-NEW staff performing work/duties unrelated to the licensed activity (e.g., porters, nurses, 
couriers) 
Trying to assess the doses received by every individual from every possible source is clearly impractical, 
so the second step is to simplify the problem. This can be done by evaluating the proximity, frequency 
and duration of exposure of persons in each group to identify the most exposed persons. Then, you need 
only evaluate these “worst case” exposures within each group, because it can be safely assumed that all 
other persons in each group receive lesser doses. 
The final stage of the occupancy review is to determine where and how long. That is: 
• 
Where are the nuclear substances present and for how long? 
• 
Where are the most exposed individuals present and for how long?  
Implicit in this part of the evaluation is that only the locations that will contribute significantly to the 
doses incurred need to be considered. For instance, consider a nuclear medicine technologist working 
with a patient on the treadmill in the stress-testing room in figure A1. At the same time, the technologist 
will be receiving some radiation dose from injected patients who may be present in camera rooms 1 and 2 
or the post-injection waiting area. However, because of the longer distances between the technologist and 
these sources of exposure and the intervening shielding, these doses will be negligibly small in 
comparison with the dose received from the patient on the treadmill. Thus, while the technologist is in the 
stress-testing room, only the dose received from the patient on the treadmill needs to be evaluated. 
Example: 
For the purpose of the example, the following assumptions have been made: 
• 
All work is shared equally between three nuclear medicine technologists. In comparison with the 
technologists, radiologists are present in the department only periodically, for relatively short periods 
of time and with minimal direct exposure to injected patients or radiopharmaceuticals. 
• 
There are one or more full-time receptionists for the nuclear medicine department who spend 
essentially all of their time in the reception office. The same is true for the adjacent outpatient clinic. 
May 2023 
REGDOC-2.5.6, Design of Rooms Where Unsealed Nuclear Substances Are Used 
 
 
18 
 
 
• 
Other ancillary staff, such as porters and cleaning and maintenance staff, are present only 
infrequently, with restricted access to areas in which nuclear substances are used and with minimal 
direct exposure to injected patients or radiopharmaceuticals. 
• 
Family members accompanying patients who are undergoing nuclear medicine procedures are present 
only for a few hours per year. 
• 
Physicians working in the adjacent outpatient clinic spend approximately one half of their time in the 
examining rooms immediately adjacent to the camera suites and the stress-testing room. 
• 
The clinic is a single-story building, built on grade, so there is no occupancy below and very minimal 
occupancy above (e.g., during roof repairs). 
From these assumptions and the facility layout given in figure A1, it is reasonable to expect that: 
• 
The nuclear medicine technologists are the most exposed persons amongst the NEWs, and since the 
work is divided equally among them, the doses they receive should be very similar. 
• 
The receptionists in the nuclear medicine department and the physicians performing work related to 
the licensed activity in the adjacent rooms are likely to receive the highest non-NEW occupational 
exposures due to their lengthy exposure times and relatively close proximity to the camera and stress-
testing rooms. 
• 
Members of the public (other than the patients themselves) should receive doses well below those 
received by the receptionists and/or physicians, but staff performing work unrelated to the licensed 
activity whose offices are in near proximity (beside or above/below the nuclear medicine department) 
will receive the highest doses among the individuals in this category. 
Therefore, doses need to be estimated for only three representative individuals: a nuclear medicine 
technologist, a nuclear medicine receptionist and a physician performing work unrelated to the licensed 
activity in the adjacent outpatient clinic.

An occupancy factor of ⅓ is applied

Although procedures will be split

when evaluating the dose to a

in one room, since this will not alter

An occupancy factor of 1 is used

The contributions from source 
locations A, B and C are evaluated 
because there is no shielding 
between these source locations and 
the reception area. 
The contribution from E2 is 
evaluated because it is immediately 
adjacent to the reception area. 
D and E1 can probably be omitted 
because the radiation that injected 
patients emit in these rooms must 
pass through multiple shielded 
walls to reach the reception area. 
However, it is prudent to evaluate 
E1 to confirm that the dose 
contribution from this point to the 
reception area will be negligible.

Source locations A, B and C are

they will make a negligibly small

Step (4) Dose rate calculations 
Radiation dose rate calculations should be made for each potentially occupied area. There are two basic 
methods of estimating the radiation dose rates to which staff and the general public (excluding the patient) 
will be exposed as a result of typical nuclear medicine operations. 
The first method is to take direct measurements of the dose rates in surrounding areas using a sufficiently 
sensitive, properly calibrated radiation survey meter. The type, model, energy range and energy response 
of the dose rate meter to be used should be provided. Because dose rates in the surrounding rooms and 
areas are typically very low, the survey meter used should have a scaler function to allow for long 
counting times (e.g., 10 minutes or more) to reduce uncertainty in the measurement. Background radiation 
is to be subtracted from the measured target dose rate. The background dose rate measurement should be 
made with the same long counting time in an area or room that is physically isolated and at a distance 
from any nuclear substances. This method is generally useful when evaluating an existing department or 
when conducting a comparative analysis for designing a new room or department that is similar in layout 
and design to an existing site. It is particularly useful when an applicant needs to analyze the impact of 
proposed changes, such as increased workload or changes to the facility layout.  
Measurements can be performed after normal operating hours by placing source vials that contain the 
typical average quantities of the appropriate nuclear substances at representative locations (e.g., the centre 
of the scanning bed to represent a patient undergoing a scan). Alternatively, sample measurements could 
simply be taken at each location over the course of a typical working day. In either case, care must be 
taken to ensure that the activities and nuclear substances being used when the measurements are taken are 
truly representative of normal operating conditions, when an average is taken over a suitably 
representative timeframe (e.g., daily, weekly, yearly). It is also important to stress that in many cases, 
very low dose rates (just barely above background) need to be measured in order to ascertain annual 
doses. In such cases, dose rate meters with integrated counting must be employed in order to capture 
statistically significant data. The lower the dose rate, the longer the integration time should be. The 
applicant should aim for ten-minute integration times for very low dose rates, always making sure to 
subtract the background values, which should be captured using the same integration time. 
The second method is a mathematical approach that relies on the known physical properties of the nuclear 
substances being used, the distances to each occupied area and the shielding properties and thickness of 
the building materials. As such, it is generally useful when designing a new room or department. 
The following is a general formula for performing dose rate calculations. 
Equation 1: 
𝑅= 𝛤× 𝐴 × 10−(

𝑇𝑉𝐿1)

if t is thicker than TVL1, then:

Where: 
R

Γ 
is the specific gamma ray constant for nuclear substance 
(mSv h-1 MBq-1 m2) 
A 
is the activity of nuclear substance 
(MBq) 
d 
is the distance between nuclear substance and location 
(m) 
t 
is the thickness of shielding material in any shielded barrier 
between nuclear substance and location 
(mm) 
TVL (1&2) 
is the first and second tenth-value layer (TVL) thicknesses of 
material for a given nuclear substance (i.e., the thickness of 
material that would be required to reduce the photon radiation dose 
rate produced by the nuclear substance to 1/10 of its initial value for 
the first tenth-value layer and a subsequent 1/10 of its value for the 
second tenth-value layer) 
(mm) 
Specific gamma ray constants are defined in terms of the dose rate (e.g., mSv h-1) at one metre from the 
source (m2), per unit of source activity (e.g., MBq-1), but the exact units used may vary between different 
references. When performing dose rate calculations, care must be taken to ensure the consistency of units 
between R, Γ and A.  For consistency, the CNSC has published the Radionuclide Information Booklet 
(RIB) [8], which provides dose rate constants, half- and tenth-value layers, as well as other useful 
information for a variety of commonly used nuclides. Note that the CNSC RIB provides first and second 
half- and tenth-value layers; using both will yield more accurate results than using the first layer only, 
especially for poly-energetic nuclides. The RIB also provides an Excel formula for calculating dose rates 
using the first and second half- and tenth-value layers. For simplicity, the examples below show the 
calculation using the first tenth-value layer only. 
Example: 
Table A5 on the following page summarizes the parameters required to perform the dose rate estimates 
for this example. The distances d were measured directly from figure A1 for the nuclear medicine 
reception area and exam room 2. To calculate doses to the nuclear medicine technologists, their proximity 
to the patient when performing diagnostic procedures was estimated based on internal room dimensions 
and typical work procedures. Lead thicknesses are based on the assumption that all interior walls of the 
stress-testing room, camera room 1 and camera room 2 are lined with 1/16-inch (1.6 mm) lead. 
All other interior walls are assumed to be constructed of ordinary drywall (gypsum board) and to provide 
minimal attenuation. 
The last column of table A5 lists the calculated dose rates at each location for each of the exposed groups 
considered, for bone scan and cardiac stress-testing procedures. A sample calculation for one 
representative source location (E2), exposure group (receptionist) and procedure (cardiac stress-testing, 
stress component) is given below:

𝑅= 3.44 × 10−5 mSvh-1 
For simplicity, there was no correction for the decay of Tc-99m in this calculation. While decay will 
cause some reduction in the calculated dose rate, the reduction will be relatively small. For example, if the 
procedure lasts 1.5 hours, the initial rest injection will have decayed to the following, which is still 84% 
of its initial value, by the end of the procedure: 
𝑅= 370𝑀𝐵𝑞 × 2−( 1.5ℎ
6.02ℎ) 
𝑅= 311𝑀𝐵𝑞 
In the context of the requirement to keep radiation doses ALARA, corrections of this magnitude are 
unlikely to be the difference between an acceptable or unacceptable design. However, applicants may 
choose to explicitly account for decay in their design analysis.

Step (5) Annual dose rate calculations 
Patients typically occupy several different locations over the course of the nuclear medicine procedure 
and may contribute to the dose received by a person occupying a single location (e.g., the dose from 
patients in the injection room, scanner rooms and post-injection waiting areas may all contribute to the 
dose received by the receptionist at the front desk). Exposed persons may also occupy several different 
areas over the course of any given day, some of which may contribute far more significantly to the total 
radiation dose they receive. 
Once the dose rate in each occupied area – generated by each combination of procedure, source location 
and occupancy factor – has been either calculated or measured, the resulting annual dose received by 
persons in that area can be estimated by multiplying the dose rate by the total exposure duration per year. 
For a given combination of procedure, source location, occupied location and exposed person, the total 
exposure duration per year is given by the product of: the total number of procedures performed per year 
(N, see table A2); the occupancy factor for the exposed person and occupied location (T, see table A2); 
the dose rate (R, see table A5); and the duration of time (S) the source/injected patient is present at the 
designated source location (in hours). The annual dose (D) is then: 
Equation 2: 
𝐷= 𝑁×  𝑇×  𝑅×  𝑆 
Example: 
Table A6 summarizes the parameters required to estimate the dose rate for the example. Estimated total 
procedure times were given in table A2. These are broken down into the approximate times the 
source/patient spends at each key location (S) in table A6. 
For example, cardiac stress-testing was estimated to require 1.5 hours.   
This has been divided into: 
2 minutes for the test injection 
0.033 h 
20 minutes in the post-injection waiting room 
0.33 h 
15 minutes scanning in either camera room 
0.25 h 
2 minutes for the stress test injection 
0.033 h 
20 minutes in the waiting room 
0.33 h 
15 minutes in the treadmill room 
0.25 h 
15 minutes scanning in either camera room 
0.25 h 
Total: 
1.48 h 
The last column of table A6 lists the calculated annual doses at each location, for each of the exposed 
groups considered, for both the bone scan and cardiac stress-testing procedures. A sample calculation for

one representative source location (E2), exposure group (receptionist) and procedure (cardiac stress-
testing, stress component) is given below: 
N 
1750 procedures per year (1750 y-1) 
T 
1 
R 
3.8 × 10-5 mSvh-1 
S 
0.25 hr 
Using equation 2: 
D 
= N × T × R × S 
Dcamera 2, reception 
= 1750 y-1  × 1 × 3.8 × 10-5 mSv h-1 × 0.25 hr 
 
= 1.66 × 10-2 mSv 
Explicit calculations of the dose a nuclear medicine receptionist would receive as a result of scans in 
camera room 1 have been dropped, since it is clearly demonstrated in table A5 that the dose rate in 
nuclear medicine reception due to patients in camera room 1 will be trivially small (< 1 nSv h-1). When 
calculating the annual dose to a nuclear medicine receptionist and to a physician in the adjacent outpatient 
clinic, the total scanning workload, including both cardiac stress-testing and bone scans, is presumed to be 
split evenly between camera rooms 1 and 2. The total doses listed are the sum of each of the doses from 
the individual procedures for each of the exposed persons. 
A few interesting aspects about the calculated doses should be mentioned. First, note that 60% of the 
nuclear medicine technologists’ dose is estimated to be received in the relatively short periods of time 
they spend either directly handling the Tc-99m or in very close proximity to the patient while delivering 
the injection. This suggests that when examining operating procedures with the aim of keeping doses 
ALARA, improvements to these procedures are likely to have the greatest benefit. 
Similarly, the receptionist at this hypothetical clinic potentially receives the greatest dose from injected 
patients waiting to be scanned, despite having a designated “hot” patient waiting area well removed from 
the reception desk. If dose reduction were deemed to be necessary, adding shielding to the east wall of the 
injected-patient waiting area could be considered. 
Finally, note that despite the extended periods of time physicians in the adjacent outpatient clinic spent in 
the examining rooms located very close to the scanning rooms, their doses are negligibly small due to the 
shielding incorporated into the walls of the scanning rooms.

Conclusion 
The annual dose to the receptionist and reception area, assuming 100% occupancy, is less than 200 µSv. 
The annual dose to the physician in the adjacent clinic is less than 20 µSv. 
To complete the dose assessment, the annual doses are estimated for other staff and members of the 
general public, other than the patient, who are in and around the nuclear medicine rooms at the facility. 
The CNSC may consider that an ALARA assessment is not required when individual occupational doses 
are unlikely to exceed 1 mSv per year, when the dose to individual members of the public is unlikely to 
exceed 50 µSv per year, and when the annual collective dose (both occupational and public) is unlikely to 
exceed 1 person-Sv (as recommended in REGDOC-2.7.1, Radiation Protection, as amended from time to 
time) [4]. 
 
Shielding calculations for positron emitting nuclear substances 
The basic approach to shielding calculations for positron emitting nuclear substances or any other high-
energy gamma-emitting nuclear substance, such as I-131, is similar to that for conventional diagnostic 
nuclear medicine, as outlined in the previous example. The only significant difference is the thickness of 
shielding required due to higher energies. In such cases, the use of lead may be impractical due to weight 
and structural considerations. Concrete, either in poured slabs or one solid block, is generally a more 
viable solution to positron emitting nuclear substances shielding issues. 
To illustrate this, consider the previous example in which 1/16-inch (1.6 mm) lead shielding was used to 
line the camera rooms. For Tc-99m, which emits 141 keV gamma rays, this equates to 1.6 mm/1.1 mm = 
1.45 tenth-value layers of shielding, which reduces the radiation dose rates and corresponding doses in 
surrounding areas to 3.5% of their unshielded values. 
By contrast, positron emitting nuclear substances all decay via positron emission and thus emit two 511 
keV annihilation gammas per decay. At this energy, the first TVLs for lead and concrete are 
approximately 17 mm and 24 cm, respectively. Note that because positron emitting nuclear substances all 
emit gammas at the same energy, the TVLs do not change from nuclear substance to nuclear substance. 
To achieve the same degree of attenuation for positron emitting nuclear substances would therefore 
require 1.45 x 17 mm = 24.6 mm of lead, or 1.45 x 24 cm = 34.8 cm of concrete. 
In such cases, the use of lead becomes impractical because of weight and structural considerations. For 
example, an 8-foot by 12-foot wall of lead 30 mm thick would weigh 3000 kg and would require a 
structural support wall capable of retaining this load. Thus, concrete – either in poured slabs or as a solid 
concrete block – is a much more viable solution to positron emitting nuclear substances shielding 
problems. The heavy shielding requirements for positron emitting nuclear substances make it difficult to 
retrofit an existing room to accommodate a PET scanner. 
The periodical Medical Physics (33, 1; January 2006) provides useful technical information and guidance 
on shielding requirements and dose estimates specifically related to positron emitting nuclear substances 
operations [9].  
Shielding calculations for in-patient I-131 therapy 
There is very little difference between the shielding calculations for conventional diagnostic nuclear 
medicine and for in-patient nuclear medicine therapy treatments, such as I-131 thyroid cancer treatment.

The patient location is essentially fixed inside what is usually a dedicated treatment room on one of the 
wards. The primary occupationally-exposed group to be considered is the nursing staff attending to the 
patients while they are in hospital. Doses to members of the general public in adjacent rooms must also be 
considered.  
As a condition of the licence, the design must be such that the dose rate in occupied areas around the 
treated patient’s room does not exceed 2.5 µSv/h or that other patients do not receive a dose in excess of 
500 µSv per hospital stay. 
For these room classifications, dose estimates are required. The same approach may be followed as 
described in Step (4) Dose rate calculations. The results will be conservative as both the thyroidal and 
extra-thyroidal biological half-lives would not be considered using this approach. Applicants are free to 
use more refined dose calculations for I-131 therapies by applying the appropriate uptake fraction and 
biological half-lives to consider the doses from the thyroidal and extra-thyroidal components of the 
patient separately. A good reference for such calculations is: Journal of Nuclear Medicine, November 
2000, 41 (11) 1868-1875.  
Calculating dose rate and doses outside of hot cells 
Licensees involved in the production of nuclear substances and/or the chemical processing of those 
nuclear substances into radiopharmaceuticals must be equipped to handle much greater quantities of 
nuclear substances than nuclear medicine departments or research laboratories can handle. Typically, they 
will have one or more heavily shielded hot cells in which processing activities are performed with remote 
manipulators that enable staff to safely perform any required handling of the nuclear substances. Hot cells 
are normally sealed when in use to prevent volatile, gaseous or fine-particulate radioactive material from 
contaminating the lab. In addition, they will normally have a dedicated ventilation system, with filters to 
minimize any such releases to the external environment. Hot cells are equipped with manipulators for the 
remote handling of objects inside the hot cell. This prevents extremity doses and reduces the risk of spills. 
A typical hot cell might be roughly 2 m high, 1.5 m wide and 1 m deep, and shielded with 75 mm of lead 
(Pb) encased in steel. This provides ~5 TVLs of shielding against positron emitting nuclear substances. 
For further information on TVLs for commonly used nuclear substances, see the CNSC’s Radionuclide 
Information Booklet [8]. 
Two typical hot cells with manipulators are shown below:

Both hot cells shown have 7.5 cm lead shielding in the walls, floor and ceiling. The lead glass windows are 18 cm thick and have a lead 
equivalence of 7.5 cm (courtesy of University of Ottawa Heart Institute). 
The five-step dose calculation method described previously can easily be extended to estimate the doses 
incurred by staff performing work using the hot cells: 
Step (1) Prepare a reasonably accurate, dimensioned sketch of the facility and surrounding areas. 
The following diagram is used for the purpose of this example.

Step (2) Identify the key locations where radioactive materials are to be used and the workload for each 
of these locations. 
• 
F-18, 185 GBq (5Ci) produced per run 
• 
F-18 is present in hot cell for one hour 
• 
Assume one production run of F-18 per day x 250 operating days per year 
Step (3) Identify the purpose, type of occupancy and occupancy factor of areas where nuclear substances 
are used, and areas in the direct vicinity of where nuclear substances are used.  
• 
Restricted access area (NEWs only) 
• 
Operator at manipulators for ⅓ hour per run 
• 
Occupancy of adjacent lab is intermittent, T = ½ 
Step (4) Estimate the radiation dose rates in each potentially occupied area.

TVL2

Therefore, outside the hot cell at one metre from the F-18, the dose rate is: 
R = (0.1398 μSv h-1 MBq-1 m2) x (185,000 MBq) x 0.1 x 10-((125-17)/14) 
R = 0.00005 µSv h-1, which is effectively ZERO 
Direct line of sight between the operator and the product should also be considered by excluding the lead 
pot shielding: 
R = (0.1398 μSv h-1 MBq-1 m2) x (185,000 MBq) x 0.1 x 10-((75-17)/14) 
R = 0.186 or for simplicity, ≈ 0.2 µSv h-1 
Step (5) Extrapolate the calculated dose rates to annual doses. 
Worst-case exposure assumes no lead pot. Ignoring decay over the exposure duration: 
May 2023 
REGDOC-2.5.6, Design of Rooms Where Unsealed Nuclear Substances Are Used 
 
 
 
34  
 
• 
Operator dose = 250 days/y x 1/3 h/day x 0.2 µSv h-1 or ≈ 17 µSv y-1 
• 
Lab staff dose = (250 days/y x 0.5 h/day x 0.2 µSv h-1)/(3m)2 ≈ 3 µSv y-1 
Thus, for the parameters assumed in the example, the shielding in the hot cell is more than adequate. This 
is in fact the case for typical automated positron emitting nuclear substances processing operations. The 
majority of staff’s dose generally comes from handling the quality control (QC) samples once they have 
been dispensed and extracted from the hot cell. The approach to QC dose calculation is effectively the 
same as that for nuclear medicine dispensing and injection operations in the previous dose calculation 
example.

Appendix B: Summary of Requirements and Guidance for  
Design Assessment Forms  
The following table “Summary of requirements and guidance for the DAFs” provides an overview of 
requirements and guidance applicable to the various room classifications. An application must indicate if 
the requirements are met or provide an alternative approach for meeting the intent of the requirements.  
Any alternative approach for meeting the intent of the requirements shall demonstrate that the ALARA 
principle is maintained. 
There are 7 DAF forms:  
• 
Intermediate-Level Room 
• 
High-Level Room 
•

example, 
radioactive 
solutions may be 
pumped into the

cell via transfer 
lines from an 
accelerator 
producing nuclear 
substances. Once 
the radioactive 
material has been

should be placed 
in a shielded
