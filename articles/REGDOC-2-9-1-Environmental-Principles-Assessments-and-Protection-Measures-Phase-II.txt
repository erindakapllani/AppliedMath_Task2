Preface 
This regulatory document is part of the CNSC’s environmental protection series of regulatory documents. 
The full list of regulatory document series is included at the end of this document and can also be found 
on the CNSC’s website. 
REGDOC-2.9.1, Environmental Principles, Assessments and Protection Measures, describes: 
 
the CNSC’s principles for environmental protection 
 
for all nuclear facilities or activities that interact with the environment, the scope of an environmental 
review and the roles and responsibilities associated with an environmental review 
 
the CNSC’s requirements and guidance to applicants and licensees for developing environmental 
protection measures, including an environmental risk assessment (ERA) where required, for both new 
and existing facilities or activities 
This document is Version 1.2. It supersedes Version 1.1, which was published in April 2017. 
Environmental protection for nuclear facilities and activities is done in accordance with the Nuclear 
Safety and Control Act (NSCA) and the regulations made under it. The CNSC requires the environmental 
effects of all nuclear facilities or activities to be considered and evaluated when licensing decisions are 
made. 
This document will be used to assess licence applications for proposed new nuclear facilities or activities, 
licence applications for existing facilities or activities (renewals and amendments), and environmental 
protection measures, as follows: 
 
all licence applications that demonstrate potential interactions between the facility or activity and the 
environment are subject to an environmental review 
 
for each facility or activity that has direct interactions with the environment, the applicant or licensee 
must demonstrate that environmental protection measures are or will be in place 
 
where an environmental risk assessment (ERA) is required for a facility or activity (details are 
included in this regulatory document): 
 
the ERA is subject to regular updates (at least every five years, and whenever a significant change 
occurs in either the facility or activity that could alter the nature (type or magnitude) of the 
interaction with the environment within the ERA predictions) 
 
the licensee’s ERA informs an environmental review 
In all cases, the environmental review, the environmental protection measures and the ERA (where 
required) are commensurate with the scale and complexity of the environmental risks associated with the 
nuclear facility or activity. 
Note: For facilities or activities other than Class I nuclear facilities and uranium mines and mills, the 
CNSC reviews every licence application to verify that there are no significant interactions with the 
environment (for example, for most Class II facilities, such as hospitals and universities, and for the use 
and transport of nuclear substances and radiation devices, there is no interaction with the environment). If 
the CNSC’s review of the application determines that the facility or activity: 
(a) has potential interactions with the environment and that additional consideration of environmental 
protection measures is warranted, the information in this document may be applied in a graded 
manner 
(b) does not interact with the environment, then only the CNSC’s guiding principles for environmental 
protection (in section 2.1 of this document) are relevant as guidance for such facilities or activities

Early engagement with CNSC staff is encouraged for facilities or activities with potential interactions 
with the environment or for applicants uncertain as to their facility’s or activity’s potential for interaction 
with the environment. CNSC staff can provide facility- or activity-specific guidance to assist applicants 
and licensees. 
A document that shows the changes made to REGDOC-2.9.1, Version 1.1 is available from the CNSC 
upon request.

Environmental Principles, Assessments and Protection Measures 
1. 
Introduction 
1.1 
Purpose 
Environmental protection for nuclear facilities and activities is done in accordance with the 
Nuclear Safety and Control Act (NSCA) and the regulations made under the NSCA. This 
legislation includes provisions to ensure that licensees are adequately protecting the environment 
and the health, safety and security of persons. The CNSC requires the environmental effects of all 
nuclear facilities or activities to be considered and evaluated when licensing decisions are made. 
This regulatory document provides information to applicants and licensees on protecting the 
environment and the health of persons, including: 
 
identification of facility or activity interactions with the environment and the public 
 
identification and mitigation of potential environmental effects associated with these 
interactions 
 
design and implementation of effluent and emission release measures and of the 
environmental monitoring measures to confirm or test the predictions and the actual effects 
 
periodic assessments of the environmental protection measures and the licensee’s 
performance 
In particular, this regulatory document describes: 
 
the CNSC’s principles for environmental protection 
 
for all nuclear facilities or activities that interact with the environment, the scope and type of 
environmental review, commensurate with the scale and complexity of the environmental 
risks 
 
the CNSC’s requirements and guidance to applicants and licensees for developing 
environmental protection measures, including an environmental risk assessment (ERA) where 
required, for both new and existing facilities or activities 
1.2 
Scope 
This regulatory document clarifies the CNSC’s expectations of applicants and licensees, and 
provides guidance for protecting the environment and the health of persons. 
This document will be used to assess licence applications for proposed new nuclear facilities or 
activities, licence applications for existing facilities or activities (renewals and amendments), and 
environmental protection measures: 
 
all licence applications that demonstrate potential interactions between the facility or activity 
and the environment are subject to an environmental review 
 
for each facility or activity that has direct interactions with the environment, the applicant or 
licensee must demonstrate that environmental protection measures are or will be in place

 
where an ERA is required for a facility or activity (details are included in this regulatory 
document): 
 
the ERA is subject to regular updates (at least every five years, and whenever a 
significant change occurs in either the facility or activity that could alter the nature (type 
or magnitude) of the interaction with the environment 
 
the licensee’s ERA informs an environmental review 
In all cases, the environmental review, the environmental protection measures and the ERA 
(where required) are commensurate with the scale and complexity of the environmental risks 
associated with the nuclear facility or activity. 
For facilities or activities other than Class I nuclear facilities and uranium mines and mills, the 
CNSC reviews every licence application to verify that there are no significant interactions with 
the environment (for example, for most Class II facilities, such as hospitals and universities, and 
for the use and transport of nuclear substances and radiation devices, there is no interaction with 
the environment). If the CNSC’s review of the application determines that the facility or activity: 
 
has potential interactions with the environment and that additional consideration of 
environmental protection measures is warranted, the information in this document may be 
applied in a graded manner 
 
does not interact with the environment, then only the CNSC’s guiding principles for 
environmental protection (in section 2.1 of this document) are relevant as guidance for such 
facilities or activities 
Early engagement with CNSC staff is encouraged for facilities or activities with potential 
interactions with the environment or for applicants uncertain as to their facility’s or activity’s 
potential for interaction with the environment. CNSC staff can provide facility- or activity-
specific guidance to assist applicants and licensees. 
Note: The intent of these requirements is not to replace or duplicate other federal, provincial or 
territorial, and municipal legislation with which licensees must comply. Where applicable, 
meeting the existing legislative requirements is adequate for meeting the requirements of this 
regulatory document.

2. 
The CNSC’s Environmental Protection Principles 
Protecting the environment is part of the CNSC’s mandate. The CNSC requires the environmental 
effects of all facilities or activities to be evaluated and considered when licensing decisions are 
made (see figure 1). For each licensing decision, the CNSC (the Commission or a Designated 
Officer) must be satisfied that the applicant or licensee will make adequate provision for the 
protection of the environment and the health and safety of persons before a licence can be 
granted. 
2.1 
The CNSC’s guiding principles for protection of the environment 
The CNSC regulates nuclear facilities and activities in Canada to protect the environment and the 
health and safety of persons in a manner that is consistent with Canadian environmental policies, 
acts and regulations and with Canada’s international obligations. 
For each facility or activity that has direct interactions with the environment, the CNSC must 
determine that the licensee or applicant has made adequate provision for the protection of the 
environment. The applicant or licensee’s licence application shall demonstrate (through 
performance assessments, monitoring or other assessments) that their environmental protection 
measures: 
 
are commensurate with the level of risk associated with the activity 
 
recognize that uncertainty exists in science and account for this uncertainty: 
o by keeping all releases to the environment as low as reasonably achievable 
(ALARA), social and economic factors being taken into account for nuclear 
substances [8] 
o through the application of the best available technology and techniques 
economically achievable (BATEA) for hazardous substances 
 
respect the precautionary principle, the “polluter pays” principle, and the concepts of 
pollution prevention, sustainable development and adaptive management 
 
are assessed against performance indicators and targets that are based on sound science 
The following sections of this regulatory document provide information on how to meet these 
principles. The CNSC assesses proposed alternative approaches and takes into account the views 
and proposals of the licensee concerning their individual situations. 
2.2 
The CNSC’s environmental protection framework 
The CNSC’s environmental protection safety and control area (SCA) covers measures that 
identify, control and monitor all releases of radioactive and hazardous substances and effects on 
the environment from facilities or as the result of licensed activities. 
The applicant’s or licensee’s environmental protection measures should address all aspects of the 
CNSC’s environmental protection SCA that are relevant to the facility or activity. The scope and 
complexity within each measure should be commensurate with the nature and scale of the 
interactions with the environment that may result from the facility or activity. 
Note: The CNSC uses the term “environmental protection measures”. The elements in these 
measures may be referenced by applicants and licensees in their “environmental protection 
programs”. Applicants and licensees are not required to update their management system or other 
documents to reflect the term “environmental protection measures”, but they must meet the 
requirements listed in this document.

The CNSC’s regulatory framework for environmental protection: 
 
respects other federal and provincial environmental legislation 
 
applies the following standards in a graded approach, commensurate with risk: 
 
CSA N288.4, Environmental monitoring programs at Class I nuclear facilities and 
uranium mines and mills [4] 
 
CSA N288.5, Effluent monitoring programs at Class I nuclear facilities and uranium 
mines and mills [5] 
 
CSA N288.6, Environmental risk assessments at Class I nuclear facilities and 
uranium mines and mills [6] (and, for further information on human exposure 
modelling, see CSA N288.1, Guidelines for calculating derived release limits for 
radioactive material in airborne and liquid effluents for normal operation of nuclear 
facilities [3]) 
September 2020 
REGDOC-2.9.1, Environmental Principles, Assessments and Protection Measures 
 
 
8 
 
 
CSA N288.7, Groundwater protection programs at Class I nuclear facilities and 
uranium mines and mills [7] 
 
CAN/CSA ISO 14001, Environmental Management Systems – Requirements with 
Guidance for Use [1, 2] 
These CSA standards apply to Class I nuclear facilities and uranium mines and mills. The CSA 
standards ensure that the risks associated with releases to the environment are continually 
assessed and mitigated; that releases are controlled and monitored; and that the environment is 
monitored. See section 4 for additional information on the application and implementation of 
these CSA standards, as well as other elements of environmental protection (for example, an 
environmental management system (EMS)). 
For facilities or activities other than Class I nuclear facilities and uranium mines and mills, the 
CNSC reviews every licence application to verify that there are no significant interactions with 
the environment (for example, for most Class II facilities, such as hospitals and universities, and 
for the use and transport of nuclear substances and radiation devices, there is no interaction with 
the environment). If the CNSC’s review of the application determines that the facility or activity 
has potential interactions with the environment (such as planned releases of radioactive or 
hazardous substances to the environment) and that additional consideration of environmental 
protection measures is warranted, the applicant or licensee applies the information in section 4 to 
their environmental protection measures in a graded approach, commensurate with risk. 
The CNSC also regulates many facilities and activities that do not have any interactions with the 
environment (that is, the facility or activity has no direct releases to the environment). A licence 
application that describes the nature of the proposed licensed activities is considered sufficient for 
ensuring protection of the environment, provided that CNSC staff conclude the facility or 
activities do not interact with the environment. In this case, the remaining information in this 
document does not apply to such facilities or activities. 
Early engagement with CNSC staff is encouraged for facilities or activities with potential 
interactions with the environment. CNSC staff can provide facility- or activity-specific guidance 
to assist applicants and licensees. 
2.3 
Other jurisdictions and federal departments 
The CNSC cooperates with other jurisdictions and federal departments to protect the 
environment. Where appropriate, the CNSC may enter into formal arrangements to increase the 
effectiveness of environmental protection. For example, the CNSC holds memoranda of 
understanding (MOUs) with other federal departments (such as Fisheries and Oceans Canada, 
Environment and Climate Change Canada). A complete list of MOUs is available on the CNSC’s 
website. 
When a proposed facility or activity must also comply with provincial or territorial legislation, 
the CNSC collaborates and coordinates the environmental protection processes where possible to 
increase efficiency and reduce duplication.

2.4 
Public and Indigenous engagement 
Participation opportunities for the public and for Indigenous groups are an important component 
of the CNSC’s environmental reviews and licensing processes. The CNSC determines the 
appropriate level of participation opportunities on a case-by-case basis. The criteria include: 
 
interests of the public and Indigenous groups 
 
the complexity of the facility or activity and its potential interactions with the 
environment and the public 
 
additional factors such as other jurisdictional mandates or type of decision

Environmental Reviews 
The CNSC requires that the environmental effects of all nuclear facilities or activities be 
considered and evaluated when licensing decisions are made. All licence applications that 
demonstrate potential interactions with the environment are subject to an environmental review 
commensurate with the scale and complexity of the environmental risks associated with the 
facility or activity. 
Early in the licensing process, CNSC staff determine which type of environmental review applies 
by considering the information provided by the applicant or licensee in their initial submission 
and supporting documentation. The information below outlines the different types of 
environmental reviews that may be applicable under the CNSC’s current regulatory framework. 
The CNSC ensures that the public has an opportunity to participate in the environmental review, 
and Indigenous consultation and engagement activities are integrated into the review process, to 
the extent possible. 
3.1 
Impact assessments under the Impact Assessment Act 
Impact assessments are conducted on projects identified as having the greatest potential for 
adverse environmental effects in areas of federal jurisdiction, either listed as a “designated 
project” in the Physical Activities Regulations or as designated by the Minister of Environment. 
The scope of impact assessments subject to the Impact Assessment Act (IAA) includes the 
environmental, health, social and economic effects – both positive and negative – of a proposed 
project. 
The Impact Assessment Agency of Canada (IAAC) leads the conduct of impact assessments for 
all designated projects subject to this legislation and works in collaboration with the CNSC to 
review projects that are also subject to regulation under the NSCA. Nuclear projects to be 
assessed under the IAA are subject to an integrated impact assessment that is carried out by a 
review panel. An integrated impact assessment means having a single assessment process with 
the shared objective that the requirements of both the IAA and the NSCA are discharged as “one 
project, one assessment”. 
A memorandum of understanding (MOU) established between the CNSC and the IAAC outlines 
the roles and responsibilities of each organization and helps guide collaboration into conducting 
integrated impact assessments under the IAA. The MOU confirms each organization’s 
commitment to ensuring that the principle of “one project, one assessment” is followed in 
reviewing designated projects regulated by the CNSC, and that any reviews are conducted in an 
efficient and effective manner, without unnecessary delays or duplication of effort.

3.2 
Federal lands reviews under the Impact Assessment Act 
Projects not listed in the Physical Activities Regulations, but proposed to be carried out on federal 
lands and requiring a decision by the CNSC as a federal authority, are subject to federal lands 
reviews under the IAA.  
September 2020 
REGDOC-2.9.1, Environmental Principles, Assessments and Protection Measures 
 
 
11 
 
Upon receipt of a licence application for proposed activities to be carried out on federal lands, 
CNSC staff review the application and make a determination whether the proposal is subject to a 
federal lands review under the IAA. If a federal lands review is required, CNSC staff post a 
notice of this determination on the Canadian Impact Assessment Registry website, review the 
proposal according to the factors provided in section 84 of the IAA, and provide their 
recommendation to the Commission. The Commission is responsible to make the decision in 
determining whether the completion of the proposed project on federal lands is likely to cause 
significant adverse environmental effects. 
The Designated Classes of Projects Order describes the classes of projects on federal lands that 
are designated by the Minister of Environment as causing only insignificant adverse 
environmental effects and that are, therefore, exempt from the federal lands requirements of the 
IAA. 
The IAAC is developing further guidance and materials on federal lands reviews in collaboration 
with federal authorities, including the CNSC. 
3.3 
Ongoing environmental assessments under CEAA 2012 
Projects with environmental assessments (EA) already initiated under the Canadian 
Environmental Assessment Act (2012) (CEAA 2012) and led by the CNSC will continue under 
their current processes as per the transition provision (section 182) of the IAA. 
An EA under CEAA 2012 is carried out early in the licensing process (at the beginning of the 
project’s lifecycle) and serves as a planning tool. The process for an EA under CEAA 2012 is 
described in appendix A. 
The CNSC has in place Generic Guidelines for the Preparation of an Environmental Impact 
Statement pursuant to the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, 2012. This document 
informs proponents of the information requirements for the preparation of an environmental 
impact statement (EIS) for a project that requires an EA under CEAA 2012. An EIS is a report 
written by a proponent that presents the technical studies and findings of an EA. 
3.4 
Environmental assessments under provincial regimes and land claim agreements 
Some proposed nuclear projects may be subject to provincial EA legislation but not subject to the 
IAA. Also, in certain parts of Canada (for example, Yukon, Northwest Territories, Nunavut, parts 
of Quebec and parts of Newfoundland and Labrador), EA processes established under land claim 
agreements apply, and the IAA does not. In both cases, the CNSC acts as a technical advisor and 
is an active participant at all stages of the EA process; however, the CNSC has no role in making 
the EA decision. The Commission retains decision-making authority on licensing matters, and 
uses the information gathered in the EA process to inform its licensing decision under the NSCA. 
When multiple jurisdictions are involved, these processes are harmonized as much as possible to 
reduce duplication and promote efficiency. 
3.5 
Environmental protection reviews under the NSCA 
The CNSC conducts environmental protection reviews (EPRs) for all licence applications with 
potential environmental interactions in accordance with its mandate under the NSCA to ensure 
the protection of the environment and the health of persons. An EPR is a science-based 
environmental technical assessment by CNSC staff as set out in the NSCA. Where there are 
September 2020 
REGDOC-2.9.1, Environmental Principles, Assessments and Protection Measures 
 
 
12 
 
potential environmental interactions, an EPR under the NSCA is conducted for projects not 
subject to the IAA or other applicable EA legislation (described above). 
An EPR describes the outcome of CNSC staff’s review of licensing and environmental 
compliance activities conducted under the NSCA. This review serves to assess whether the 
applicant or licensee will, in carrying on a licensed activity, make adequate provision for the 
protection of the environment and health of persons. This assessment is commensurate with the 
scale and complexity of the environmental risks associated with the nuclear facility or activity. 
An EPR under the NSCA is a component of the CNSC licensing and compliance verification 
process. It is carried out as part of the CNSC’s review of all licence applications of facilities and 
activities that have potential interactions with the environment. CNSC staff assess the 
environmental and health effects of nuclear facilities and activities at every phase of the lifecycle 
or duration. At each phase (that is, for each licence application), CNSC staff consider all future 
phases of the lifecycle, taking into consideration all available information. As with all other safety 
and control areas (SCAs), an EPR under the NSCA is a process of ongoing verification related to 
the environmental protection SCA.  
An EPR under the NSCA is primarily based on information that the applicant or licensee is 
required to submit to the CNSC through the established licensing process, such as the licence 
application and its supporting documentation, and information on environmental protection 
measures. An EPR under the NSCA is also based on compliance and technical assessment 
activities completed by CNSC staff (for example, reviews of annual environmental monitoring 
reports and environmental risk assessments). An EPR under the NSCA may also be supported by 
independent verification activities, such as the CNSC’s independent environmental monitoring 
program (IEMP), as well as relevant regional health studies, monitoring programs and Indigenous 
knowledge studies. 
Within a licensing process, the results of the EPR can be presented in a supporting report to 
accompany staff’s licensing report to the Commission, or it can be reported directly in that staff 
licensing report (known as a Commission Member Document (CMD)). Outside of a licensing 
process, the results of the EPR can be presented in a stand-alone report that is posted on the 
CNSC website. An EPR report is intended for two key audiences – members of the public and 
Indigenous groups, and within the context of a licensing process, the Commission. The EPR 
report is prepared with the following objectives: 
 
publishing a clear report or section that provides transparency to the public and Indigenous 
groups on CNSC staff’s technical assessment 
 
providing evidence-based information to inform the Commission’s licensing decision (note 
that no decision is made on the EPR report itself)

4. 
Environmental Protection Measures 
The necessary measures for environmental protection are determined on a facility- or activity-
specific basis. Note: Not every facility or activity is required to have every environmental 
protection measure described in this section. The applicant or licensee may address certain 
requirements by demonstrating that a particular measure is not necessary or does not apply to that 
facility or activity.  A licence application that describes the nature of the proposed licensed 
activities is considered sufficient for ensuring protection of the environment, provided CNSC 
staff conclude that the facility or activities do not interact with the environment. 
4.1 
Environmental risk assessment 
An ERA is a systematic process that identifies, quantifies and characterizes the risk posed by 
contaminants (nuclear or hazardous substances) and physical stressors in the environment. It is a 
practice or methodology that provides science-based information to support decision-making and 
to prioritize the implementation of mitigation measures. 
The applicant or licensee’s ERA informs an environmental review. The ERA: 
 
identifies facility- or activity-specific characteristics and site-specific environmental 
characteristics 
 
identifies interactions between those characteristics 
 
assesses the likelihood and significance of these interactions and the resulting potential 
effects on the environment and the public 
In conjunction with regulatory monitoring requirements, the ERA and its associated performance 
predictions serve as the basis for control and monitoring of releases, environmental monitoring, 
and any supplementary studies. All of these measures are interrelated and managed within the 
environmental management system (EMS). For additional information on an EMS, see 
section 4.6. 
The initial ERA for a new facility or activity is based on best estimates of the facility- or activity-
specific characteristics. These characteristics are combined with sufficient environmental 
characterization (such as baseline) to support the assessment of potential interactions with the 
environment and the potential for associated environmental effects.  
The ERA uses the facility- or activity-specific estimates of physical disturbances and chemical 
releases (both nuclear and hazardous substances) to predict: 
 
the source terms of gaseous and liquid discharges 
 
the transport of nuclear and hazardous substances through the environment 
 
public exposure and dose 
 
exposure and effects on representative biota 
 
changes in habitat and effects on species that rely on that habitat 
These predictions establish the basis for the CNSC’s compliance program for that facility or 
activity. 
The applicant or licensee incorporates the results of the initial ERA into their EMS, including the 
effluent and environmental monitoring measures. The predictions for physical disturbances and 
September 2020 
REGDOC-2.9.1, Environmental Principles, Assessments and Protection Measures 
 
 
14 
 
releases, and the associated environmental behavior and potential effects, are measured and tested 
using site-specific monitoring. 
The initial ERA submitted for licensing purposes for a new facility or activity is primarily 
predictive as it involves assessing the potential effects of a hypothetical facility or activity. As a 
facility or activity moves through its lifecycle, the ERA is periodically reviewed and revised (see 
section 4.1.2) using the accumulated site knowledge derived from operational experience, 
monitoring, special investigations, incorporation of advances in scientific knowledge and, where 
available, Indigenous traditional knowledge. 
These “living” ERAs, which are informed by real data from monitoring programs (emissions, 
effluents, environmental) and current science, are used to assess if the original environmental 
impact predictions are exceeded or may be exceeded in the future. In this manner, the initial ERA 
evolves through the life of the facility or activity, remaining current and becoming an 
increasingly more powerful site-specific tool. 
Requirements 
For Class I facilities and uranium mines and mills, the licensee shall conduct an ERA in 
accordance with CSA N288.6, Environmental risk assessments at Class I nuclear facilities and 
uranium mines and mills [6]. 
The ERA shall be completed in a systematic, scientifically defensible manner that identifies, 
quantifies and characterizes the risk posed by releases of nuclear and hazardous substances and 
physical disturbances (stressors) on representative human and non-human biota. The licensee 
shall ensure that the ERA includes, as applicable to the facility or activity, both an ecological risk 
assessment (EcoRA) for the environment and a human health risk assessment (HHRA) for 
members of the public. 
Guidance 
For facilities or activities other than Class I nuclear facilities and uranium mines and mills, for 
which the CNSC has determined that there are direct interactions with the environment, the 
licensee should use the ERA process described in CSA N288.6 [6] in a graded approach as 
appropriate to their circumstances. For many of these facilities, a simple screening assessment (as 
described in CSA N288.6) is adequate. Note: Although CSA N288.6 was developed for Class I 
facilities and uranium mines and mills, the methodology and general principles can be applied to 
other facilities and activities regulated by the CNSC. 
Early engagement with the CNSC is encouraged for facilities and activities that are not 
specifically addressed by CSA N288.6 [6]. The CNSC can provide facility- or activity-specific 
guidance to assist licensees. 
4.1.1 
Complexity of the environmental risk assessment 
Requirements 
The applicant or licensee shall identify facility characteristics and activities that may interact with 
the environment during the relevant phase of the facility or activity’s lifecycle (for example, site 
preparation, construction, operation and decommissioning). 
September 2020 
REGDOC-2.9.1, Environmental Principles, Assessments and Protection Measures 
 
 
15 
 
This characterization shall include descriptions of facility- or activity-specific performance with 
respect to: 
 
physical disturbances (for example, footprint for surface structures, below-grade 
structures, diversions or flow alterations of surface or groundwater) 
 
emissions released to the environment 
 
effluents released to the environment 
The facility or activity characterization shall be of sufficient detail to assess the potential for 
effects arising from the proposed maximum quantities and anticipated volumes and flow rates for 
releases associated with the facility or activity. 
The applicant or licensee shall present a characterization of the baseline environment (that is, the 
environment before any development of the facility or activity has started) for any portion of the 
environment where the site characterization indicates potential for interaction. 
The applicant or licensee shall use the facility- or activity-specific characterization and the local 
environmental baseline characterization to identify the potential interactions between the facility 
or activity and the surrounding environment. Note that these identified interactions will become 
the focus of further stages within the ERA. 
The applicant or licensee shall use the potential environmental interactions to support their 
justification as to the level of complexity for the ERA in accordance with CSA N288.6, 
Environmental risk assessments at Class I nuclear facilities and uranium mines and mills [6]. 
Guidance 
ERAs may be completed in a tiered manner reflecting the complexity of the disturbances and 
releases associated with the facility or activity and with the complexity or sensitivity of the 
surrounding environment. This tiered approach allows the rapid completion of simple screening 
risk assessments for facilities or activities with limited interaction with the receiving environment 
or the public. However, it also allows for progressively more complex quantitative assessments 
for facilities or activities when warranted by the severity and the spatial and temporal extent of 
potential effects (see figure 3).

Reviewing and revising the environmental risk assessment 
Where an ERA exists, the licensee shall review and revise the ERA in accordance with CSA 
N288.6, Environmental risk assessments at Class I nuclear facilities and uranium mines and 
mills [6]; taking into consideration whether there has been: 
 
a significant change in the facility or activity that could alter the nature (type or 
magnitude) of the interactions with the environment (such as modification, expansion or 
refurbishment of the facility) within the ERA predictions 
 
any transition to a new phase in the lifecycle (such as a transition to licence to operate, 
decommission or abandon) where the application for the new licensing phase includes 
any interactions with the environment that were not previously captured in the ERA 
September 2020 
REGDOC-2.9.1, Environmental Principles, Assessments and Protection Measures 
 
 
17 
 
The ERA shall be revised with site knowledge derived from: 
 
operational experience (for example, performance of mitigation measures such as effluent 
control systems) 
 
results of monitoring 
 
supplementary studies 
 
incorporation of recent developments in scientific knowledge 
The revised ERA shall be used to assess the environmental performance of the facility or activity. 
The ERA shall also be used to predict continued future performance and associated 
environmental effects of the facility or activity. 
If the revised ERA indicates that the nature, extent and significance of environmental effects are 
greater than  predicted, the licensee shall: 
 evaluate the environmental effects in terms of risk 
 investigate mitigation measures as necessary 
 identify any changes needed to the effluent and emissions monitoring measures resulting 
from any mitigation measures 
4.2 
Effluent and emissions control and monitoring 
Controls on environmental releases are established to provide protection to the environment and 
to respect the principles of sustainable development and pollution prevention. 
Requirements 
The preventive and control measures shall be based on the potential risks to the environment that 
the facility or activity may pose. 
The effluent and emissions control and monitoring shall: 
 
identify and document the infrastructure and activities (such as pipelines or storage) with the 
potential for significant accidental release to the environment of nuclear and hazardous 
substances and the barriers (such as primary and secondary containment, and liners) to 
prevent releases 
 
identify and document the points of release to the environment and the corresponding 
preventive control measures and equipment necessary to regulate and control the release of 
these nuclear and hazardous substances in the authorized manner 
 
estimate or measure, document and report the quality and quantity of releases to the 
environment 
 
verify the nature and quantity of releases against compliance criteria (such as authorized 
release limits), performance indicators (such as action levels) and the predictions of releases 
used as input parameters for the site-specific ERA 
 
evaluate mitigation measures to further control releases when the monitoring results identify 
deviations from the expected performance

4.2.1 
Control of environmental releases 
The effluent and emissions preventive and control measures are established on the basis of best 
industry practice, incorporating the application of BATEA, ALARA, process optimization, 
continuous improvement and the results of an ERA. 
Guidance 
A licensee’s effluent and emissions control should address the following: 
 
BATEA assessment of pollution prevention and control technologies: 
o design and maintenance of engineered barriers between key waste streams and 
sources of nuclear and hazardous substances (for example, double-lined piping, 
secondary containment and sumps, waste rock pads and pond liners), with 
maintenance programs to ensure the integrity of these barriers 
o wastewater treatment systems (for example, precipitation and settling systems, 
ion-exchange columns, evaporators and membrane separation systems such as 
reverse osmosis) that minimize the contaminants released to surface waters from 
liquid effluent streams with maintenance programs to ensure the availability and 
performance of these systems 
o air pollution control technology systems (for example, HEPA filters, baghouse 
filters, wet/dry scrubbers, absorption/adsorption systems) that minimize air 
pollutants released to the environment via air emissions through stacks or as 
fugitive emissions from the facilities with maintenance programs to ensure the 
availability and performance of these systems 
 
BATEA assessment of techniques: 
o a focus on BATEA optimization; that is, the application of pollution prevention 
performance standards, design objectives and best practices to minimize or 
eliminate the release of nuclear or hazardous substances to the environment: 
 
both operational and managerial practices that can influence the quality 
of releases to the environment (for example, upstream and downstream 
process optimization, adequate training of staff and effective overall 
management of the operation) 
 
application and continual review of action levels as indicators of a 
potential loss of control of the site-specific environmental protection 
measures, to ensure the process is operating within its approved design 
specification and normal operating conditions 
o ALARA assessments (minimization-focused); that is, the application of radiation 
protection principles to effectively minimize human and environmental exposure 
to nuclear substances 
 
processes and procedures to ensure effective management of the effluent and emission 
control systems within an EMS (for example, maintenance of treatment systems, timely 
replacement of filters, calibration of monitoring equipment and procedures detailing 
appropriate responses to action level exceedances) 
After the facility or activity is licensed, BATEA assessments of pollution prevention and control 
technologies for releases are necessary only where effects exceed, or may exceed, those identified 
in the ERA and adaptive management involving the modification or reduction of releases of 
specific nuclear or hazardous substances is indicated. 
September 2020 
REGDOC-2.9.1, Environmental Principles, Assessments and Protection Measures 
 
 
19 
 
Assessments of techniques and the processes and procedures for ensuring effective effluent and 
emission control programs should be reviewed as part of the EMS requirement for continuous 
improvement. 
4.2.2 
Monitoring of releases to the environment 
In conjunction with specific regulatory monitoring requirements, the ERA provides the technical 
foundation and structure for identifying the need for, and details of, effluent and emissions 
monitoring. The site-specific effluent and emissions monitoring is designed using the 
characterization of the locations, the anticipated volume, chemistry and flow rate of releases, and 
the proposed maximum quantities and concentrations of nuclear and hazardous substances 
(including their physical, chemical and radiological characteristics). 
For facilities and activities with no significant measurable releases to the environment, effluent 
and emissions monitoring is not required. In such cases, the licensee should demonstrate (through 
engineering or scientific methods) that appropriate barriers and practices are in place, and are 
monitored and maintained to prevent releases to the environment. 
For facilities and activities where the releases are of low risk or quantities are too low or too 
difficult to measure, monitoring is not required. The licensee may estimate emissions based on 
site-specific process chemistry and engineering principles. 
Requirements 
For Class I nuclear facilities and uranium mines and mills, the effluent and emissions monitoring 
shall address the requirements in CSA N288.5, Effluent monitoring programs at Class I nuclear 
facilities and uranium mines and mills [5].  
The effluent and emissions monitoring shall be designed and implemented: 
 
to demonstrate compliance with authorized release limits 
 
to respond to any action levels or other performance indicators, internal objectives or 
targets set on releases for effluent control 
 
to confirm the adequacy of controls on releases from the source 
 
to provide supportive data required to assess the level of risk on human health and safety 
and potential effects on the environment as determined by the ERA or regulation 
In addition, the licensee shall ensure that the effluent and emissions monitoring: 
 
demonstrates that controlled releases to water frequented by fish are not acutely lethal 
 
supports and assesses the adequacy of any adaptive management measures 
For Class I nuclear facilities and uranium mines and mills, the applicant or licensee shall assess 
and document the need for action levels. The applicant or licensee shall engage with CNSC staff 
on the requirements for establishing and implementing action levels for releases to the 
environment. 
For facilities and activities subject to the Uranium Mines and Mills Regulations, the licensee shall 
develop a facility-specific code of practice that includes, where appropriate, action levels for 
releases of nuclear and hazardous substances to the environment. 
September 2020 
REGDOC-2.9.1, Environmental Principles, Assessments and Protection Measures 
 
 
20 
 
The applicant or licensee shall assess for acute lethality any effluents that are released to water 
frequented by fish and that contain hazardous substances that could be considered deleterious 
under the Fisheries Act. Meeting existing federal or provincial requirements for toxicity testing 
shall be considered as satisfying this requirement. Otherwise, the method(s), frequency of testing 
and actions to be implemented as a result of a test failure shall be developed during licensing and 
shall be informed by existing standard practices applied to other industrial sectors. 
Guidance 
For facilities or activities other than Class I nuclear facilities and uranium mines and mills, for 
which the CNSC has determined that there are direct interactions with the environment, the 
licensee should use the process described in CSA N288.5 [5] in a graded approach as appropriate 
to their circumstances. Note: Although CSA N288.5 [5] was developed for Class I facilities and 
uranium mines and mills, the methodology and general principles can be applied to other 
facilities and activities regulated by the CNSC. 
The measurement and evaluation of environmental releases are key to verifying the efficacy of 
preventive and control measures. The overall process should include feedback mechanisms (both 
periodic and continual) to assess and implement actions to achieve performance targets. 
Monitoring should be conducted on a temporal scale relevant to the nature and complexity of the 
release (such as intermittent, continuous or batch), and should use a standard sampling 
methodology (or a non-standard methodology approved by CNSC staff) that is appropriate for the 
type of release (see figure 4). 
Figure 4: Types of releases that may be associated with a nuclear facility or activity that can 
influence sampling methodology and frequency (CSA N288.5 [5]) 
 
Effluent and emission monitoring addresses both the nature and quantities of releases of nuclear 
and hazardous substances (including wastes). Performance indicators for operational control, such 
as action levels (where required), should be established to serve as early indicators of potential 
loss of control or deviation from expected quality or quantity of releases. Performance indicators 
should be designed to initiate investigation of abnormal situations and, if necessary, result in 
corrective measures. Measurement and evaluation should be coordinated to permit timely 
corrective action. 
For facilities and activities other than Class I nuclear facilities and uranium mines and mills, for 
which the CNSC has determined that there are direct interactions with the environment, licensees 
should consider incorporating the development of similar environmental performance indicators, 
such as action levels, in their effluent and emission monitoring.

4.3 
Environmental monitoring 
Environmental monitoring consists of a risk-informed set of integrated and documented activities 
to sample, measure, analyze, interpret and report one or all of: 
 
the concentration of nuclear and hazardous substances in environmental media to assess 
one or both of: 
o the exposure of receptors to those substances 
o the potential effects on human health, safety and the environment 
 
the intensity of physical stressors and/or their potential effect on human health and the 
environment 
 
the physical, chemical and biological parameters of the environment normally considered 
in the design of the environmental monitoring necessary to support the interpretation of 
the results; some examples are supportive data for transport (such as wind velocity) or 
toxicity assessment (such as organic carbon or hardness) or measurements at reference 
stations (where incorporated in the monitoring) 
Requirements 
For Class I nuclear facilities and uranium mines and mills, the licensee shall ensure that the 
environmental monitoring addresses CSA N288.4, Environmental monitoring programs at 
Class I nuclear facilities and uranium mines and mills [4]. 
The licensee shall use applicable regulatory monitoring requirements and the ERA to identify the 
need for and complexity of the environmental monitoring. The licensee shall provide justification 
to support whether ERA-derived environmental monitoring is required. In the justification, the 
licensee shall address: 
 
characteristics of the licensed facility or activity 
 
characteristics of the surrounding environment 
 
nuclear and hazardous substances and physical stressors 
 
receptors that can be affected 
 
spatial extent of potential exposures 
 
severity, probability, and spatial and temporal extent of any potential biological effects 
The licensee shall ensure that the environmental monitoring measures, plans and data provide 
sufficient information to assess exposure or potential effects on human health and the 
environment due to releases or physical perturbations resulting from the facility or activity. 
The licensee shall ensure that the results of the environmental monitoring are used to confirm that 
the effects on the environment are within the licensing predictions and adequate provisions are in 
place to protect the environment. 
Guidance 
For facilities or activities other than Class I nuclear facilities and uranium mines and mills, for 
which the CNSC has determined that there are direct interactions with the environment, the 
licensee should use the process described in CSA N288.4, Environmental monitoring programs 
at Class I nuclear facilities and uranium mines and mills [4] in a graded approach, as appropriate 
to their circumstances. Note: Although CSA N288.4 [4] was developed for Class I facilities and 
September 2020 
REGDOC-2.9.1, Environmental Principles, Assessments and Protection Measures 
 
 
22 
 
uranium mines and mills, the methodology and general principles can be applied to other 
facilities and activities regulated by the CNSC. 
Monitoring for the presence of stressors (physical stressors or nuclear and hazardous substances) 
in the environment is sometimes more informative than monitoring the release at the source. The 
practice of monitoring ambient air quality is common for atmospheric emissions, especially 
fugitive or diffuse emissions (such as radon from ore pads). 
The results of the environmental monitoring should: 
 
be used to validate the predictions related to transport of nuclear and hazardous 
substances through the environment and the magnitude and extent of any effects 
predicted in the site-specific ERA to determine if the facility or activity continues to 
operate within its predicted environmental performance 
 
be periodically reviewed (in conjunction with the periodic revision and update of the 
ERA) as to its adequacy for testing the environmental predictions 
 
be modified as necessary to support and assess the adequacy of any adaptive management 
measures 
Environmental monitoring may involve three basic types of monitoring objectives (see CSA 
N288.4 [4]): 
 
pathways monitoring 
 
biological effects monitoring 
 
supplementary studies 
Pathways monitoring is the most common form of monitoring. It involves sampling and 
analyzing abiotic and biotic media that lie along the pathways connecting a source (that is, a 
release from a facility or activity) to a receptor (such as non-human biota or the public) to 
determine the concentration or level of a contaminant or physical stressor in that medium. This 
data, combined with environmental transfer parameters that describe the movement of 
contaminants or physical stressors through the environment, may be used to assess the exposure 
of the receptor. Some examples of the most common sampling media are: 
 
components of air, water, soil and sediment 
 
vegetation consumed by herbivorous receptors 
 
tissues of prey animals consumed by carnivorous receptors 
 
foodstuffs consumed by humans 
Such environmental monitoring is only necessary for those facilities or activities where the 
releases have the potential to be measurable within the environment. The monitoring details, with 
respect to the analytes being measured (physical stressors, nuclear and hazardous substances) and 
the media to be sampled (air, water, and so on), are dependent on the scale and complexity of the 
risks associated with the facility or activity. 
Biological effects monitoring is used to detect actual measurable biological responses of 
organisms to exposure to the stressor. For regulatory purposes, responses at the individual, 
population or community level of biological organization are considered to be more relevant as 
September 2020 
REGDOC-2.9.1, Environmental Principles, Assessments and Protection Measures

indicators of ecological effects. Some examples of biological effects monitoring that may be 
relevant depending on the risk posed by the facility or activity include: 
 
toxicity testing using exposure media (such as effluent receiving waters or exposed 
sediments) 
 
fish health and population indicators (such as gonadal somatic index and egg production) 
 
monitoring of plant or benthic invertebrate community composition (benthic 
invertebrates or plants) 
Supplementary studies may be conducted to achieve specific well-defined objectives such as: 
 
providing the data required to reduce uncertainty and confounding factors in the ERA 
 
increasing knowledge of the behavior of contaminants and physical stressors in the 
environment (for example, refining environmental transfer parameters) 
 
investigating monitoring results that indicate potential deviation from the transport or effects 
predictions in the ERA or the licensing basis 
4.4 
Public dose 
Radiological releases to the environment are controlled and monitored by the effluent and 
emissions control and monitoring and the environmental monitoring. Results of these monitoring 
and control activities are used to determine dose to members of the public. 
A human health risk assessment (HHRA) is completed as a sub-element of an ERA for both 
nuclear and hazardous substances. 
Requirements 
The Radiation Protection Regulations define prescribed dose limits for workers and members of 
the public, and require doses to be monitored by direct measurement or by estimation of the 
quantities and concentrations of any nuclear substance released as a result of a licensed activity. 
The Radiation Protection Regulations require licensees to implement a radiation protection 
program for protection of the public. The focus for radiation protection within the environmental 
protection framework is on radiological protection of the environment and the public. 
Guidance 
The development of a radiation protection program should be based on a sound policy, strategy 
and method for radiation protection and the achievement of ALARA, while taking into 
consideration the pathways and critical groups identified in the derived release limits (DRL) 
document (CSA N288.1, Guidelines for calculating derived release limits for radioactive 
material in airborne and liquid effluents for normal operation of nuclear facilities [3]). 
The licensee should design the radiation protection program commensurate with the radiological 
hazards associated with the licensed activities, based on an ERA and including radiation exposure 
and dose assessments. 
4.5 
Groundwater protection and monitoring 
Groundwater protection is a specialized element of the overall environmental protection 
measures. As groundwater flow and associated contaminant transport can be more difficult to 
September 2020 
REGDOC-2.9.1, Environmental Principles, Assessments and Protection Measures 
 
 
24 
 
detect and delineate than that of surface water, specific requirements and guidance are provided 
here. 
Groundwater protection is an inter-related system of initiatives, processes and activities with the 
overall goal of protecting the quality and quantity of groundwater by minimizing interactions 
with the environment from activities associated with a nuclear facility, allowing for effective 
management of groundwater resources. 
Requirements 
For Class I nuclear facilities and uranium mines and mills, the licensee shall ensure that the need 
for and design of groundwater protection programs and associated monitoring address CSA 
N288.7, Groundwater protection programs at Class I nuclear facilities and uranium mines and 
mills [7]. 
The applicant or licensee shall implement a groundwater protection program in a graded 
approach, appropriate to their circumstances, to: 
 
prevent or minimize releases of nuclear or hazardous substances to groundwater 
 
prevent or minimize the effects of physical stressors on groundwater end uses 
 
confirm that adequate measures are in place to stop, contain, control and monitor any 
releases and physical stressors that can occur under normal operation 
Guidance 
For facilities or activities other than Class I nuclear facilities and uranium mines and mills, for 
which the CNSC has determined that there are direct interactions with the environment, the 
applicant or licensee should implement a groundwater protection program and associated 
monitoring program in accordance with CSA N288.7, Groundwater protection programs at 
Class I nuclear facilities and uranium mines and mills [7] in a graded approach as appropriate to 
their circumstances. Note: Although CSA N288.7 [7] was developed for Class I facilities and 
uranium mines and mills, the methodology and general principles can be applied to other 
facilities and activities regulated by the CNSC. 
Groundwater protection programs are developed on a site-specific basis and should consider the 
following elements: 
 
identification of sources of contaminants of concern 
 
investigation of releases under normal operation and source characterization 
 
site characterization 
 
assessment of groundwater end-use 
 
assessment of groundwater vulnerability 
 
development of a groundwater monitoring program 
 
risk management (as required) 
4.6 
Environmental management system 
An environmental management system (EMS) refers to the management of an organization’s 
environmental policies, measures and procedures in a comprehensive, systematic, planned and 
documented manner. It includes the organizational structure, planning and resources for 
September 2020 
REGDOC-2.9.1, Environmental Principles, Assessments and Protection Measures 
 
 
25 
 
developing, implementing and maintaining policy for environmental protection and for 
continuous improvement by: 
 
identifying and managing environmental risks associated with a facility or activity (see 
section 3 and section 4.1) 
 
the identification, implementation and maintenance of pollution control activities and 
technologies (see section 4.2.1) 
 
monitoring of releases (see section 4.2.2) 
 
monitoring of contaminants and for their potential effects in the environment (see 
section 4.3) 
In addition, the EMS should address environmental emergency preparedness. 
The EMS serves as the management tool for integrating all of the applicant or licensee’s 
environmental protection measures in a documented, managed and auditable process by: 
 
identifying and managing non-compliances and corrective actions within the activities, 
through internal and external inspections and audits 
 
summarizing and reporting the performance of these activities, both internally (licensee’s 
management structure) and externally (to the Commission and the public) 
 
training of the personnel involved in these activities 
 
ensuring the availability of resources (such as qualified personnel, organizational 
infrastructure, technology and financial resources) 
 
defining and delegating roles, responsibilities and authorities essential to effective 
environmental management 
The EMS may be implemented within the licensee’s integrated management system. 
Requirements 
For Class I nuclear facilities and uranium mines and mills, the licensee shall manage their 
environmental protection measures within an EMS that reflects the nature and complexity of their 
environmental protection measures. 
The licensee shall: 
 
establish, implement and maintain an EMS that meets the requirements set by 
CAN/CSA ISO 14001, Environmental Management Systems – Requirements with 
Guidance for Use (2004 edition or successor editions) [1, 2] 
 
ensure that the scope of the EMS is consistent with the definition of environment, 
environmental effects and pollution prevention provided in the glossary of this regulatory 
document 
 
conduct internal audits at planned intervals so that all elements of the EMS are audited on 
at least a five-year cycle 
 
conduct an annual management review 
Guidance 
For facilities or activities other than Class I nuclear facilities and uranium mines and mills, for 
which the CNSC has determined that there are direct interactions with the environment, the 
September 2020 
REGDOC-2.9.1, Environmental Principles, Assessments and Protection Measures 
 
 
26 
 
applicant or licensee should manage their environmental protection measures within an EMS that 
reflects the nature and complexity of their environmental protection measures. 
In addition to the information provided in this regulatory document, the licensee should refer to 
the following documents: 
 
CAN/CSA ISO 14001, Environmental Management Systems – Requirements with 
Guidance for Use (2004 edition or successor editions) [1, 2] 
 
CAN/CSA ISO 14004, Environmental Management Systems – General Guidelines on 
Principles, Systems and Support Techniques [11] 
Note: The CNSC does not consider certification to CAN/CSA ISO 14001 by an authorized 
registrar or other independent third party as solely sufficient for demonstrating compliance with 
the requirements. The CNSC evaluates all activities in relation to the requirements of this 
regulatory document. The CNSC’s compliance verification focuses on the effectiveness of the 
EMS rather than on the licensee’s adherence to CAN/CSA ISO 14001 (2004 edition or successor 
editions) [1, 2]. 
During the design of an EMS, the ISO documents provide guidance and information that may be 
useful; however, the licensee should note that, as a federal agency, the CNSC has adopted certain 
key concepts in environmental protection from other federal statutes. Where applicable, the 
CNSC expects licensees to apply the more-demanding meanings from federal legislation in the 
scope of their EMS. 
To avoid misinterpretation of these concepts, the licensee should review the following differences 
between key concepts in federal legislation and those in CAN/CSA ISO 14001 (2004 edition or 
successor editions) [1, 2] and consider them in the scope of their EMS: 
 
the CNSC’s definitions of environment, environmental effect (i.e., impact) and pollution 
prevention (i.e., prevention of pollution) in this regulatory document are taken from federal 
legislation and are broader than the definitions of the related terms in CAN/CSA 
ISO 14001 (2004 edition or successor editions) [1, 2] 
 
in both the NSCA and the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999 (CEPA 1999), risk 
is a key concept in environmental protection that is not addressed in CAN/CSA 
ISO 14001 [1, 2] 
 
the licensee should use the ERA as one of the core sources to inform the significant 
environmental aspects and effects of the EMS 
 
CAN/CSA ISO 14001 [1, 2] provides only minimal guidance on the interpretation of adverse 
environmental effects 
Pollution prevention is the key principle underlying the management of hazardous substances in 
Canada. Section 64 of CEPA 1999 defines the nature of toxic substances, explicitly defining 
unreasonable risk for certain scheduled substances. For other potentially hazardous substances 
that are not subject to legislation, unreasonable risk may be interpreted in terms of likely 
significant adverse effects. This concept is nearly equivalent to the CAN/CSA ISO 14001 [1, 2] 
concept of significant environmental effects. In the CNSC licensing process for Class I nuclear 
facilities and uranium mines and mills, the process for an EPR under the NSCA or an impact 
assessment under the Impact Assessment Act provides an initial framework for identifying and 
assessing the equivalent of ISO-significant environmental aspects in an appropriate context. This 
information can provide the initial foundation for the scope of the EMS. 
September 2020 
REGDOC-2.9.1, Environmental Principles, Assessments and Protection Measures

For nuclear substances, the Radiation Protection Regulations require exposure and doses to 
persons to be managed according to the ALARA (as low as reasonably achievable) principle, 
while taking social and economic factors into account. G-129, Keeping Radiation Exposures and 
Doses “As Low As Reasonably Achievable (ALARA)” [8] provides additional information. 
The Radiation Protection Regulations define risk for workers and the public through prescribed 
dose limits, and require doses to be monitored by direct measurement or by estimation of the 
quantities and concentrations of any nuclear substance released as a result of the licensed activity. 
The EMS framework should cover the assessment of releases and potential effects, the measures 
to control releases of nuclear substances and hazardous substances into the environment, and the 
measures taken to prevent or mitigate potential effects. 
The framework should be appropriate for the type of facility or activity and the licensing phase, 
and should be commensurate with overall regulatory requirements. In addition to the 
environmental protection measures described in detail earlier, the EMS should address  
environmental emergency preparedness. 
4.6.1 
Environmental emergency preparedness 
The licensee should address environmental emergency preparedness and response in terms of: 
 
the proposed measures to prevent or mitigate the effects of accidental releases of nuclear 
and hazardous substances on the environment 
 
the proposed measures to ensure the availability and accessibility of environmental 
monitoring instrumentation during emergencies 
 
the inclusion of environmental monitoring instrumentation and equipment layouts in 
emergency plans 
The licensee should address reporting requirements for potential or real emergency situations. 
For additional guidance, refer to REGDOC-2.10.1, Nuclear Emergency Preparedness and 
Response [12]. 
4.6.2 
Other considerations 
The licensee should describe elements of the EMS related to worker training or qualifications, 
and the environmental protection obligations of workers. The licensee should demonstrate how 
training programs will enable workers to meet their obligations with respect to environmental 
protection.

Appendix A: Environmental Assessments Under CEAA 2012 
Note: Projects with environmental assessments (EA) already initiated under the Canadian 
Environmental Assessment Act (2012) (CEAA 2012) and led by the CNSC will continue under 
their current processes, as per the transition provision (section 182) of the IAA. The following 
appendix is relevant to those ongoing projects and will remain in this regulatory document for 
reference purposes until those projects are completed. 
The CNSC ensures that the environmental assessment (EA) requirements of the Canadian 
Environmental Assessment Act, 2012 (CEAA 2012) are met for designated projects (described in 
CEAA 2012) that are regulated under the Nuclear Safety and Control Act (NSCA). 
An EA under CEAA 2012: 
 
predicts the environmental effects of a proposed designated project 
 
identifies mitigation measures 
 
assesses whether the proposed project is likely to cause significant adverse environmental 
effects, taking into account the identified mitigation measures 
 
ensures a follow-up program is developed to verify the accuracy of the EA predictions 
under CEAA 2012 and the effectiveness of any mitigation measures 
An EA conducted under CEAA 2012 is a planning tool. It is carried out early in the licensing 
process (before any licence is granted) and considers the entire proposed lifecycle of a project. An 
EA under CEAA 2012 includes information prepared by the applicant and CNSC staff, as well as 
comments received from Indigenous groups and the public. After reviewing the EA, the 
Commission determines if the proposed project is likely to cause significant adverse 
environmental effects, taking into consideration the implementation of mitigation measures. 
In accordance with paragraph 15(a) of CEAA 2012, the CNSC is the sole federal responsible 
authority (RA) for conducting an EA for designated projects regulated under the NSCA and 
described in the Regulations Designating Physical Activities, as follows: 
“31 The construction, operation and decommissioning of a new uranium mine or uranium 
mill on a site that is not within the licensed boundaries of an existing uranium mine or 
uranium mill. 
32 The expansion of an existing uranium mine or uranium mill that would result in an 
increase in the area of mine operations of 50% or more. 
33 The construction, operation and decommissioning of a new 
(a) facility for the processing, reprocessing or separation of an isotope of uranium, thorium, 
or plutonium, with a production capacity of 100 t/year or more; 
(b) facility for the manufacture of a product derived from uranium, thorium or plutonium, 
with a production capacity of 100 t/year or more; or 
(c) facility for the processing or use, in a quantity greater than 1015 Bq per calendar year, of 
nuclear substances with a half-life greater than one year, other than uranium, thorium or 
plutonium. 
34 The expansion of an existing 
(a) facility for the processing, reprocessing or separation of an isotope of uranium, thorium 
or plutonium that would result in an increase in production capacity of 50% or more and 
a total production capacity of 100 t/year or more; 
September 2020

(b) facility for the manufacture of a product derived from uranium, thorium or plutonium that 
would result in an increase in production capacity of 50% or more and a total production 
capacity of 100 t/year or more; or 
(c) facility for the processing or use, in a quantity greater than 1015 Bq per calendar year, of 
nuclear substances with a half-life greater than one year, other than uranium, thorium or 
plutonium, that would result in an increase in processing capacity of 50% or more. 
35 The construction, operation and decommissioning of a new nuclear fission or fusion 
reactor. 
36 The expansion of an existing nuclear fission or fusion reactor that would result in an 
increase in power output of 50% or more. 
37 The construction and operation of a new 
(a) facility for the storage of irradiated fuel or nuclear waste, on a site that is not within 
the licensed perimeter of an existing nuclear facility; or 
(b) facility for the long-term management or disposal of irradiated fuel or nuclear waste. 
38 The expansion of an existing facility for the long-term management or disposal of 
irradiated fuel or nuclear waste that would result in an increase in the area, at ground level, of 
the facility of 50% or more.” 
The Minister of Environment and Climate Change Canada may also designate a physical activity 
that is not prescribed by the Regulations Designating Physical Activities if the project may cause 
adverse environmental effects or if there are public concerns related to those effects. 
For these designated projects: 
 
the CNSC must make an EA decision in accordance with section 52 of CEAA 2012 
before a regulatory decision can be made under the NSCA to allow the project to proceed 
 
if the CNSC determines that the project is not likely to cause significant adverse 
environmental effects in accordance with subsection 52(1) of CEAA 2012, then in 
accordance with section 53 and through the licensing process, the CNSC establishes the 
mitigation measures and, where applicable, follow-up activities that the applicant must 
implement 
 
if the CNSC determines that the project is likely to cause significant adverse 
environmental effects, then in accordance with section 52(2) of CEAA 2012, the CNSC 
will refer to the Governor in Council the matter of whether those effects are justified in 
the circumstances 
Licensing, compliance and verification activities undertaken by CNSC staff ensure that the 
applicant has implemented the mitigation measures identified in the EA. Where applicable, the 
licensing, compliance and verification activities will also be used to ensure the implementation of 
a follow-up program. 
If an applicant proposes to carry on an activity following the completion of an EA under 
CEAA 2012, the applicant must complete the CNSC licensing process, including safety and 
control measures for protection of the environment and of the health and safety of persons.

A.1 
Environmental assessment under CEAA 2012 conducted by the CNSC 
The applicant chooses whether to complete an EA under CEAA 2012 via an integrated approach 
with the CNSC licensing process, or a sequential approach. 
Under an integrated approach, the EA is conducted at the same time as the review of the 
information in the applicant’s licence application, enabling CNSC staff to present their 
recommendations for the EA and the licence application to the Commission at the same 
Commission proceeding (for example, a meeting, a hearing or an abridged hearing). 
Under a sequential approach, the EA is conducted first, with a subsequent review of the licence 
application. This approach may be more appropriate when, for example, an applicant uses the EA 
to assess the feasibility of a project. 
Note: 
 
after the EA is completed, the applicant is responsible for submitting all remaining 
documentation to fulfill the CNSC’s licensing requirements to undertake project activities 
 
if sufficient time elapses between the EA decision and the submission of the 
corresponding licence application that there is new science and/or technology, new 
policy, changes in the environment, or any project modifications with a potentially 
different impact on the environment, CNSC staff may require the applicant to update the 
previous EA information to take into account these additional considerations 
CEAA 2012 does not set regulated timelines for EAs conducted by the CNSC. However 
(pursuant to the Class I Nuclear Facilities Regulations and the Uranium Mines and Mills 
Regulations), the CNSC is committed to completing this process within the 24-month federal 
timeline for a licensing decision under the integrated approach. Furthermore, CNSC staff’s 
service standard for completing an EA under CEAA 2012 under a sequential approach is also a 
24-month federal timeline. Adherence to this schedule, for both integrated and sequential 
approaches, is facilitated by the completeness of information received from applicants, and the 
process will begin when the notice of commencement is posted.  
Note: The 24-month federal timeline applies to CNSC activities, and not to the time periods 
required for steps outside the CNSC’s control, such as time the applicant needs to prepare 
technical studies or to respond to requests for additional information or circumstances that are 
specific to the project.

A.2 
Key steps for an environmental assessment under CEAA 2012 
The process for an EA conducted by the CNSC under CEAA 2012 includes the following key 
steps. 
Step 1: Applicant conducts pre-project engagement with the CNSC 
Applicants may begin to determine the feasibility of a project before submitting a project 
description and (for an integrated approach) a licence application. Early communication with the 
CNSC is recommended, to help applicants: 
 
identify projects that must undergo an EA in accordance with CEAA 2012 
 
understand the regulatory requirements 
 
understand the CNSC’s EA and licensing processes (that is, an integrated EA compared 
to a sequential EA) and the associated anticipated timelines 
 
clarify the information to be included in the project description 
 
identify the potential involvement of other jurisdictions 
 
identify Indigenous groups whose Indigenous or treaty rights may be affected or 
Indigenous groups with an interest in the project 
 
determine the appropriate level of public and Indigenous engagement activities 
To facilitate planning, the CNSC encourages applicants and licensees to submit their project 
descriptions as early as possible. 
The CNSC may allow some applicants to apply a graded approach to the requirements for a 
project description as set out in the Prescribed Information for the Description of a Designated 
Project Regulations. This possibility should be discussed and determined during pre-project 
engagement. 
September 2020 
REGDOC-2.9.1, Environmental Principles, Assessments and Protection Measures 
 
 
33 
 
For early engagement and planning purposes, the CNSC may initiate early discussions with other 
federal, provincial or territorial authorities and Indigenous groups as soon as an applicant 
indicates their intent to seek regulatory approval for a proposed project. The objective of early 
engagement is to support a more timely and efficient process for the EA under CEAA 2012. For 
more information, see step 4, below. 
Step 2: Applicant submits a project description and/or licence application 
For a sequential approach applied to a proposed new facility (that requires a new licence 
application), the applicant submits both of the following: 
 
a project description that provides the information set out in the Prescribed Information 
for the Description of a Designated Project Regulations 
 
an initial licence application with the necessary information needed to start the EA 
process, and a schedule for submission of the remaining material 
For a sequential approach applied to an existing facility with proposed new activities (that 
requires a licence amendment), the applicant submits a project description only. 
For an integrated approach, the applicant submits both of the following: 
 
 a project description that provides the information set out in the Prescribed Information 
for the Description of a Designated Project Regulations 
 
a licence application 
The CNSC may request additional information, even if the project description generally conforms 
to these regulations, as required to complete the EA determination. 
Step 3: CNSC determines if an EA under CEAA 2012 is required 
A nuclear project undergoes an EA under CEAA 2012 if it meets the description of a designated 
project in the Regulations Designating Physical Activities or if it has been designated by the 
Minister of Environment and Climate Change Canada. Using the information provided in the 
project description, the CNSC determines if the project is a designated project, and completes an 
EA determination memorandum that documents the findings. 
If an EA under CEAA 2012 is required, the CNSC informs the applicant. 
If an EA under CEAA 2012 is not required, the applicant must still meet CNSC licensing 
requirements before the licence is issued, including submission of information that allows CNSC 
staff to conduct an EA under the NSCA to ensure the applicant or licensee will, in carrying out 
the project, ensure the protection of the environment and of the health of persons, as described in 
section 3. 
For an EA under CEAA 2012: 
 
As the sole federal responsible authority for nuclear projects, the CNSC contacts provincial 
jurisdictions to determine if there are any other provincial EA requirements. Where 
applicable, the CNSC works with other jurisdictions to determine if their EA requirements 
can be addressed through a single EA process (to reduce duplication and provide regulatory 
efficiency). Relevant federal and provincial EA agreements provide direction regarding 
jurisdictional roles and responsibilities in the assessment of such projects. 
September 2020 
REGDOC-2.9.1, Environmental Principles, Assessments and Protection Measures 
 
 
34 
 
 
The CNSC may delegate the conduct of an EA or any part thereof to another jurisdiction. In 
such cases, the responsibility for making a decision under subsection 52(1) of CEAA 2012 
remains with the Commission. Delegation of EA-related matters for a given project are 
determined on a case-by-case basis in accordance with section 26 of CEAA 2012. 
 
The CNSC contacts other federal authorities to determine if additional regulatory decisions 
are required to allow the project to proceed. The CNSC also engages the appropriate federal 
authorities to determine whether they can provide specialist or expert information or 
knowledge to support the conduct of the EA. 
 
The CNSC ensures that a notice of commencement of an EA is posted on the Canadian 
Environmental Assessment Registry (CEAR). This notice provides a brief description of the 
project, the jurisdictions involved, and CNSC contact information. The CNSC posts a similar 
notice on the CNSC website, and provides a link to the notice of commencement on CEAR. 
The CNSC also distributes the notice to its subscription list and sends a formal notice to 
identified Indigenous groups. 
Step 4: Defining participation opportunities 
Indigenous consultation activities are integrated in the EA process to the extent possible. For 
more information, see REGDOC-3.2.2, Indigenous Engagement [10]. 
The CNSC ensures that the public is provided with an opportunity to participate in the EA. The 
breadth and timing of public participation is at the discretion of the CNSC. For example, a public 
review period may be conducted on the project description to solicit the views of the public, 
Indigenous groups and other stakeholders to help inform the conduct of the EA under 
CEAA 2012. Other opportunities could include public outreach sessions (such as open houses or 
information sessions); a public review on documentation (such as the environmental impact 
statement (EIS) or EA report); or participation in a public hearing on the EA. 
Step 5: Determining the scope of the EA 
Under subsection 19(1) of CEAA 2012, the CNSC is required to consider certain factors in the 
EA under CEAA 2012 (see subsection A.3). The Commission determines the scope of these 
factors in a Commission proceeding. 
CNSC staff will notify the applicant of the final scope of factors determined by the Commission, 
including any additional requirements that are to be included in the conduct of the technical 
studies and EIS. 
September 2020 
REGDOC-2.9.1, Environmental Principles, Assessments and Protection Measures 
 
 
35 
 
Step 6: Applicant conducts technical studies and submits the EIS 
The conduct of the technical studies and preparation of an EIS are typically delegated to the 
applicant. The document Generic Guidelines for the Preparation of an Environmental Impact 
Statement pursuant to the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, 2012 [13] informs applicants 
of the information requirements for the preparation of an EIS for a project that requires an EA 
under CEAA 2012.  
The applicant submits the EIS and any supporting technical studies to the CNSC for a technical 
review. 
Note: To meet CEAA 2012 requirements, the applicant should complete a baseline 
environmental characterization (see appendix B), and an environmental effects characterization 
(see appendix C). Specific requirements under CEAA 2012 are described in subsection A.3. 
Step 7: Technical review of the EIS 
CNSC staff and, where applicable, other federal and provincial authorities perform an in-depth 
technical review of the EIS and supporting technical studies. If certain areas need to be clarified, 
confirmed or improved based on the technical review, the CNSC may ask the applicant to provide 
additional information to resolve these issues. 
When CNSC staff are satisfied that the applicant has adequately addressed all information gaps, 
the technical review is considered to be complete. 
Step 8: EA report 
The CNSC must ensure that an EA report is prepared. The EA report includes CNSC staff’s 
conclusions regarding the potential environment effects, the proposed mitigation measures, and 
whether the project is likely to result in significant adverse environmental effects, as well as 
follow-up program requirements. 
CNSC staff draft the EA report, which synthesizes the applicant’s technical information and takes 
into account the results of the technical review, including any comments received from other 
parties. 
The CNSC may request other federal agencies to review the EA report or to provide expert 
information or knowledge. Comments received will be considered in the development of the EA 
report. 
Step 9: Commission proceeding on the EA report 
CNSC staff prepare a document summarizing the EA report’s conclusions and recommendations, 
and outlining the EA-related decisions that the Commission needs to make. This document and 
the EA report are submitted to the Commission, along with any public comments received 
(including how the CNSC staff addressed the comments). The Commission uses this information 
to inform its decision. 
For public hearings, a notice of public Commission hearing is posted on the CNSC website at 
least 60 days before the scheduled hearing to inform the public and Indigenous groups with 
hearing information, including information on how to intervene at the hearing. The CNSC also 
September 2020 
REGDOC-2.9.1, Environmental Principles, Assessments and Protection Measures 
 
 
36 
 
sends a copy of the notice to identified Indigenous groups. This procedure enables interested 
parties to request intervenor status from the Commission for the public hearing and to send their 
comments on the EA report. 
Public hearings are usually held at the CNSC headquarters in Ottawa, but the Commission may 
decide to hold such a hearing in a community in the vicinity of the proposed project. 
The exact nature of the public hearing depends on whether the project is following an integrated 
or sequential EA and licensing process. This information is provided in the notice of public 
Commission proceeding. 
Where other federal authorities provided expert information or knowledge during the conduct of 
the EA under CEAA 2012, the Commission may request their participation in the public hearing. 
Following the public hearing, the Commission makes a decision, based on the EA, on whether the 
project is likely to cause significant adverse environmental effects, taking into account mitigation 
measures that were identified during the EA. This decision must be made before a licensing 
decision can be made on allowing the project to proceed. 
If the Commission concludes that a project is not likely to cause significant adverse 
environmental effects in accordance with subsection 52(1) of CEAA 2012, the Commission (in 
accordance with section 53) must establish through the licensing process, the mitigation measures 
and follow-up activities that the applicant must implement. 
If the Commission concludes that a project is likely to cause significant adverse environmental 
effects in accordance with subsection 52(2) of CEAA 2012, the Commission refers to the 
Governor in Council the matter of whether those effects are justified in the circumstances. 
The Commission’s decision is published on the CNSC website and the CEAR. Indigenous groups 
and members of the public who have expressed an interest in a particular project may be directly 
notified of the decision. 
A.3 
Specific CEAA 2012 environmental assessment requirements 
Where the information is common to both the EIS and the licence application, the applicant may 
provide the information in either the application or the EIS, with appropriate cross-referencing 
between the submissions. The applicant shall clearly indicate where the requirements of both the 
NSCA and CEAA 2012 are addressed. 
The EA of a designated project shall take into account the following factors as listed in 
subsection 19(1) of CEAA 2012: 
a) the environmental effects of the designated project, including the environmental effects 
of malfunctions or accidents that may occur in connection with the designated project and 
any cumulative environmental effects that are likely to results from the designated project 
in combination with other physical activities that have been or will be carried out 
b) the significance of those environmental effects 
c) comments from the public that are received in accordance with CEAA 2012 
d) mitigation measures that are technically and economically feasible and that would 
mitigate any significant adverse environmental effects of the designated project 
e) the requirements of the follow-up program in respect of the designated project 
September 2020 
REGDOC-2.9.1, Environmental Principles, Assessments and Protection Measures 
 
 
37 
 
f) the purpose of the designated project 
g) alternative means of carrying out the designated project that are technically and 
economically feasible and the environmental effects of any such alternative means 
h) any changes to the designated project that may be caused by the environment 
i) the results of any relevant study conducted by a committee established under section 73 
or 74 of CEAA 2012 
j) any other matter relevant to the EA that the responsible authority requires to be taken into 
account 
Pursuant to subsection 19(2) of CEAA 2012, the scope of the factors to be taken into account 
under paragraphs 19(1)(a), (b), (d), (e), (g), (h) and (j) is determined by the Commission, as a 
responsible authority. 
The EIS and supporting technical studies are completed to meet the requirements of CEAA 2012, 
paragraphs 19(1)(a), (b), (d), (e), (f), (g), (h) and, if appropriate, (i) and (j) in accordance with the 
scope of these factors as determined by the CNSC. The completion of the EIS and, as necessary, 
supporting technical studies is typically delegated to the applicant in accordance with section 23 
of CEAA 2012. This regulatory document provides requirements and guidance to support project 
planning and early development of these documents by the applicant. These requirements and 
guidance do not negate the importance of pre-project engagement or the potential for project-
specific EA guidelines. 
A.3.1 
Purpose of the project 
Paragraph 19(1)(f) of CEAA 2012 states that the EIS shall identify the purpose of the project 
(defined as what is to be achieved by carrying out the project). 
For further guidance, consult Addressing “Purpose of” and “Alternative Means” under the 
Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, 2012 [14]. 
A.3.2 
Alternative means for carrying out the project 
Paragraph 19(1)(g) of CEAA 2012 states that the EIS shall identify and describe alternative 
means to carry out the project that are, from the perspective of the applicant, technically and 
economically feasible. As identified by the proponent, the alternative means include options for 
locations, development, and implementation methods, routes, designs, technologies, mitigation 
measures, and so on. Alternative means may also be related to the construction, operation, 
expansion, decommissioning and abandonment of a physical work. 
The approach and level of effort applied to addressing alternative means is established on a 
project-by-project basis taking into consideration: 
 
the characteristics of the project 
 
the environmental effects associated with the potential alternative means 
 
the health or status of valued components (VCs) that may be impacted by the alternative 
means 
 
the potential for mitigation and the extent to which mitigation measures may address 
potential environmental effects 
 
the level of concern expressed by the public and Indigenous groups 
The EIS should also describe the environmental effects of each alternative means. The criteria 
used to identify alternative means as unacceptable, and how these criteria were applied, should be 
September 2020 
REGDOC-2.9.1, Environmental Principles, Assessments and Protection Measures 
 
 
38 
 
described, as should the criteria used to examine the environmental effects of each remaining 
alternative means to identify the preferred alternative. 
For further guidance, consult Addressing “Purpose of” and “Alternative Means” under the 
Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, 2012 [14]. 
A.3.3 
Environmental effects 
Paragraph 19(1)(a) of CEAA 2012 states that the EA must take into account the environmental 
effects of the designated project. 
The environmental effects that must be considered in an EA under CEAA 2012 are also 
requirements under the NSCA. As described in section 4, the applicant should conduct an ERA in 
accordance with CSA 288.6, Environmental risk assessments at Class I nuclear facilities and 
uranium mines and mills [6]. 
A.3.4 
Malfunctions and accidents 
Paragraph 19(1)(a) of CEAA 2012 states that malfunctions and accidents shall be assessed in the 
EA. Malfunctions and accidents should be separated into radiological and non-radiological 
(conventional). 
The applicant should provide an assessment of potential health and environmental effects 
resulting from postulated radiological and conventional malfunctions or accidents. The EIS 
should also include any mitigation measures such as monitoring, contingency, clean-up or 
restoration work in the surrounding environment that would be required during or immediately 
following the postulated malfunction and accident scenarios. 
The EIS should provide a description of postulated malfunction and accident sequences leading to 
a radiological or non-radiological release considering, as appropriate, internal events, external 
events and human-induced events, including their frequency and an explanation of how these 
events were identified, and any modeling that was performed. 
The applicant can use a bounding approach or use facility- or activity-specific information (for 
example, design, operation, projected environmental releases) in the assessment of radiological 
accidents and malfunctions. If a bounding approach is used, the applicant should provide a 
detailed rationale for the selection of each bounding scenario. 
The EIS should include the source, quantity, mechanism, pathway, rate, form and characteristics 
of contaminants and other materials (physical and chemical) likely to be released to the 
surrounding environment during the postulated malfunctions and accidents. 
Note: Malfunctions and accidents are reviewed in depth under the NSCA for licensing purposes 
(for example, under REGDOC-2.4.1, Deterministic Safety Analysis [15], REGDOC-2.4.2, 
Probabilistic Safety Assessments for Nuclear Power Plants [16] and REGDOC-1.1.1, Site 
Evaluation and Site Preparation for New Reactor Facilities [17]). These scenarios should be 
taken into consideration by the applicant when designing environmental protection measures (see 
section 4). 
If applicable, the applicant should use operating experience (OPEX) to identify any past abnormal 
operations, accidents and spills to the extent that they are relevant to the current assessment for 
the purposes of identifying malfunction and accident scenarios to be assessed.

A.3.5 
Cumulative effects 
Paragraph 19(1)(a) of CEAA 2012 states that the applicant shall assess any residual adverse 
environmental effects of the project in combination with other past, present or reasonably 
foreseeable projects and/or activities within the study area. 
The applicant should explain the approach and methods used to identify and assess cumulative 
effects. The approach and methods should be consistent with Assessing Cumulative 
Environmental Effects under the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, 2012 [18]. 
A.3.6 
Significance of residual effects 
Paragraph 19(1)(b) of CEAA 2012 states that the applicant shall assess the significance of any 
residual effects that persist, taking into consideration the proposed mitigation measures. These 
residual effects are identified during the ERA or a characterization of the environmental effects. 
In the EIS, the applicant should include a detailed analysis of the significance of each residual 
effect. The applicant should clearly explain the method and definitions used to describe the level 
of the residual adverse effect (for example, low, medium, or high) for each of the issues. The 
applicant should also describe any cumulative environmental effects that are likely to result from 
the designated project in combination with other physical activities that have been or will be 
carried on and how these levels were combined to reach an overall conclusion on the significance 
of the adverse effects for each valued component (VC). 
Guidance 
Some specific issues to be assessed are: 
 
magnitude of the effect 
 
spatial extent of the effect 
 
duration and frequency of the effect 
 
degree to which the effect can be reversed or mitigated 
 
ecological importance  
The method used to describe the level of the adverse effect should be transparent and 
reproducible. 
The EIS should identify additional criteria used to assign significance ratings to any predicted 
adverse effects. It should contain clear and sufficient information to enable the CNSC and the 
public to understand and review the applicant’s judgement of the significance of effects. The 
applicant should define the terms used to describe the level of significance. In assessing 
significance against the criteria, the EIS should, where possible, employ relevant existing 
regulatory documents, environmental standards, guidelines or objectives such as prescribed 
maximum levels of emissions or discharges of specific hazardous substances into the 
environment or maximum acceptable levels of specific hazardous substances in the environment. 
A.3.7 
Socio-economic environment 
The applicant should characterize the socio-economic environment and identify all indirect socio-
economic effects. 
An indirect effect is a secondary environmental effect that occurs as a result of a change that a 
project may cause to the environment. Paragraph 5(2)(b) of CEAA 2012 refers to any change to 
September 2020 
REGDOC-2.9.1, Environmental Principles, Assessments and Protection Measures 
 
 
40 
 
the environment caused by the project on health and socio-economic conditions, physical and 
cultural heritage, or any structure, site or thing that is of historical, archaeological, 
paleontological or architectural significance. 
For additional guidance, refer to Technical Guidance for Assessing Physical and Cultural 
Heritage or any Structure, Site or Thing that is of Historical, Archeological, Paleontological or 
Architectural Significance under the Canadian Environment Assessment Act, 2012 [19]. 
A.3.8 
Community and Aboriginal traditional knowledge 
Subsection 19(3) of CEAA 2012 states that community and Aboriginal traditional knowledge 
may be considered in the EA. CNSC staff will provide guidance to the applicant at the earliest 
possible stage in the EA process concerning the extent to which community and Aboriginal 
traditional knowledge shall be considered in the EA. 
For additional information, refer to: 
 
Considering Aboriginal traditional knowledge in environmental assessments conducted 
under the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, 2012 [20] 
 
REGDOC-3.2.2, Indigenous Engagement [10] (for further information on the CNSC’s 
expectations of applicants for Indigenous engagement) 
A.3.9 
Assessment of effects of the environment on the project 
Paragraph 19(1)(h) of CEAA 2012 states that the EIS shall take into account how the 
environment could adversely affect the project. The applicant shall also take into account any 
potential effects of climate change on the project, including an assessment of whether the project 
might be sensitive to changes in climate conditions during its lifecycle. 
Some adverse environmental conditions are flooding, severe weather, biophysical hazards (such 
as algae), geotechnical hazards and seismic events. 
A.3.10 
EA follow-up program 
Paragraph 19(1)(e) of CEAA 2012 states that the EIS shall include a framework or preliminary 
program upon which EA follow-up actions will be managed throughout the life of the project. 
The applicant should design the follow-up program to verify the accuracy of the EA predictions 
and to determine the effectiveness of the measures implemented to mitigate the potential adverse 
environmental effects of the project. 
The applicant should also design the follow-up program to incorporate pre-project information 
that would provide the baseline data; compliance data such as established environmental quality 
criteria; regulatory documents, standards or guidelines; and real-time data consisting of observed 
data gathered in the field. As part of the follow-up program, the applicant should describe the 
compliance reporting methods to be used, including reporting frequency, methods and format. 
Note: The CNSC, in collaboration with other federal authorities (where applicable), verifies and 
monitors all EA follow-up activities through the CNSC licensing and compliance process. EA 
follow-up monitoring activities may be integrated within the applicant’s environmental protection 
measures.

Appendix B: Characterization of the Baseline Environment for an 
Environmental Assessment Under CEAA 2012 
Note: Projects with environmental assessments (EA) already initiated under the Canadian Environmental 
Assessment Act (2012) (CEAA 2012) and led by the CNSC will continue under their current processes, as 
per the transition provision (section 182) of the IAA. The following appendix is relevant to those ongoing 
projects and will remain in this regulatory document for reference purposes until those projects are 
completed. 
For a new licence, the applicant should use the information in this appendix to develop a characterization 
of the baseline environment. During the lifecycle of the facility or activity, the licensee should use this 
information to review and update the characterization, and also use the information in appendix C to 
document and predict the future environmental effects compared to this baseline characterization. 
For additional information, see appendix D for a sample matrix for mapping the facility/activity-
environmental-component interactions. 
B.1 
Atmospheric environment

study areas, with emphasis on characterizing radiological and non-radiological analytes. 
The description should include meteorological information such as air temperature, relative 
humidity, precipitation, wind speed and direction, atmospheric pressure, and solar radiation. It 
should also include the occurrence of weather phenomena (for example, lightning, temperature 
inversions and fog). Special consideration should be given to the analysis of extreme and rare 
meteorological phenomena (for example, tornadoes).Uncertainties should be described and taken 
into account when discussing the reliability of the information presented. 
The description should also include current ambient daytime and nighttime noise levels at the site 
and local study areas, and include information on its source(s), geographic extent and temporal 
variations. The description should provide ambient noise levels for other areas that could be

 
increased traffic along transportation corridors to and from the site during construction 
 
receptors at residences and sensitive sites (such as hospitals, schools, daycare facilities, 
seniors’ residences, and places of worship) 
The applicant or licensee should describe the influence of regional topography or other features 
that could affect weather conditions in the study areas. 
The baseline information should be sufficient to support the use of an atmospheric dispersion 
model to conduct the site-specific ERA and to support an assessment of the effects of the 
environment on the project (for example, tornadoes).

Appendix C: Environmental Effects for an Environmental Assessment Under 
CEAA 2012 
Note: Projects with environmental assessments (EA) already initiated under the Canadian Environmental 
Assessment Act (2012) (CEAA 2012) and led by the CNSC will continue under their current processes, as 
per the transition provision (section 182) of the IAA. The following appendix is relevant to those ongoing 
projects and will remain in this regulatory document for reference purposes until those projects are 
completed. 
The licensee should have already developed a characterization of the baseline environment (see 
appendix B) and should use the information in this appendix to document the environmental effects of a 
facility or activity. For additional information, see appendix D for a sample matrix for mapping the 
facility/activity-environmental-component interactions. 
C.1 
Atmospheric environment 
The licensee should characterize the effects of the facility or activity on the atmospheric 
environment during all phases of the lifecycle for the facility or activity, including postulated 
accident and malfunction scenarios. 
The licensee should identify and characterize all atmospheric emissions (radiological and non-
radiological) expected to be generated during all phases of the lifecycle for the facility or activity, 
including postulated accident and malfunction scenarios. This information should include average 
and maximum emissions from planned discharges, point sources and fugitive (non-point source) 
releases (including greenhouse gases). 
The licensee should complete modelling that incorporates baseline (or existing ambient) air 
quality in combination with the predicted site-specific atmospheric characteristics (such as 
shoreline fumigation) to assess potential effects on air quality, the transport of atmospheric 
contaminants and any associated exposure to humans and non-human biota receptors. 
The licensee should describe predicted effects of noise on terrestrial and aquatic species as well 
as on nearby residents and communities. The description should include both daytime and 
nighttime noise levels and tonal noise. The predicted sound levels should be compared against 
baseline levels and any guidelines published by recognized organizations. 
C.2 
Surface water environment 
The licensee should describe the effects of the facility or activity on the surface water 
environment during all phases of the lifecycle for the facility or activity, including accident and 
malfunction scenarios. 
The licensee should identify and characterize all liquid effluents that could be generated during 
all phases of the facility or activity. Some examples are: 
 
average and maximum emissions from point sources (concentrations/activity levels and 
volumes) 
 
planned discharges 
 
fugitive releases 
 
deposition from airborne particulates 
 
surface runoff

C.3 
Aquatic environment 
For all phases of the lifecycle for the facility or activity, the licensee should describe the effects of 
the facility or activity on aquatic flora and fauna, and include a full accounting of effects on 
species of natural conservation status and their habitat. This evaluation should be based on results 
of field monitoring studies or predictions from an ecological risk assessment.  
The description should be clear on how predicted effects to the biota exposed to the stressor 
compare to the expected reference condition for unexposed biota on a biological population basis, 
taking natural variation into account. Predictions of effects should include sufficient detail to 
allow follow-up verification. 
Some potential effects are: 
 
effects on habitat, including aquatic vegetation and sensitive areas such as spawning 
grounds, nursery areas, winter refuges and migration corridors 
 
effects on aquatic species, including rare or sensitive species 
 
effects of blasting on fish and fish habitat on local aquatic systems 
 
contaminant exposures through environmental and food-chain transport 
 
effects on aquatic biota due to impingement and entrainment 
 
effects of infilling on loss of fish habitat and changes to productive capacity 
 
effects of thermal plume(s) on fish and fish habitat 
 
effects on wetlands 
Under the NSCA, the CNSC assesses the ongoing operation of nuclear facilities and activities to 
ensure protection of the environment and the health and safety of persons. 
Under the Memorandum of Understanding between CNSC and Fisheries and Oceans Canada 
(DFO), the CNSC is responsible for conducting reviews of licence applications to assess the 
potential effects on fish and fish habitat, and to ensure that the assessment process considers the 
intent and requirements of the Fisheries Act, the Species at Risk Act and their associated 
regulatory and policy frameworks. 
C.4 
Geological and hydrogeological environment 
The geological and hydrogeological environment includes the bedrock and overburden geology at 
both the local and regional scales. 
C.4.1 
Geology 
The licensee should fully describe any changes to the geology and geomorphology resulting from 
the facility or activity, including any interrelationships with the groundwater regime. 
The licensee should describe any changes to the environment resulting from the removal of 
bedrock and/or unconsolidated deposits. The licensee should also describe the disturbance of soils 
or sediments that may be stockpile, used for construction purposes or otherwise perturbed. 
The licensee should include an assessment of changes made that would affect coastal processes 
and features (such as changes to the shoreline morphology due to construction, erosion or 
sediment transport). 
September 2020 
REGDOC-2.9.1, Environmental Principles, Assessments and Protection Measures 
 
 
49 
 
C.4.2 
Hydrogeology 
The licensee should describe and assess any effects the facility or activity may have on the 
groundwater regime including the quantity and quality of groundwater and how these effects may 
influence surface waters. The licensee should carry out modelling as needed to develop and test 
the predicted effects. 
C.5 
Terrestrial environment 
The licensee should describe the effects of the facility or activity on terrestrial fauna and flora and 
include a full accounting of effects on species with elevated conservation status and their habitat. 
This evaluation should be based on results of field monitoring studies or predictions from an 
ecological risk assessment. The description should be clear on how predicted effects to the biota 
exposed to the stressor compare to the expected “reference condition” for unexposed biota on a 
biological population basis taking into account natural variation. Predictions of the effects should 
include sufficient detail to allow follow-up verification. 
Some potential effects that should be considered are: 
 
loss of terrestrial habitat and the quality of lost habitat for relevant species 
 
disturbance of feeding, nesting or breeding habitats 
 
physical barriers to wildlife 
 
disruption, blockage, impediment and sensory disturbance (such as light effects, noise 
and vibration) of daily or seasonal wildlife movements (such as migration or home 
ranges) 
 
direct and indirect wildlife mortality 
 
reduction in wildlife productivity 
 
contaminant exposures through environmental and food-chain transport 
 
effects on biodiversity 
C.6 
Ambient radioactivity 
The licensee should describe the effects of the facility or activity on ambient radioactivity. 
Humans and non-human biota exposed to ambient radioactivity should be assessed for all 
relevant routes of exposure (both internal and external exposure scenarios). 
To support the assessment of human health (see section 3.2.7), the licensee should provide 
information on radiation levels to which members of the public may be exposed, including 
consideration of consumers of country food whose exposure pathways may differ due to cultural 
norms; for example, any dietary characteristics of Indigenous peoples. 
C.7 
Human health 
The licensee should describe the potential effects of the facility or activity on the physical well-
being of Indigenous groups and other people resulting from biophysical effects, including the 
effects of the facility or activity on all environmental components (for example, atmospheric 
environment) and the resulting effects on human health. 
Some examples are: 
 
an analysis of the effects of the facility or activity on the health and safety of the public, 
including the possible effects from malfunctions and accidents (radiological and 
conventional) 
September 2020 
REGDOC-2.9.1, Environmental Principles, Assessments and Protection Measures 
 
 
50 
 
 
the predicted radiation doses to members of the public resulting from activities within the 
scope of the facility or activity and any resulting health effects 
 
a description of quantitative risk assessment modeling conducted, where necessary, for 
any malfunctions and accidents 
 
an assessment of the potential effects on human health from all non-radiological 
contaminants released from the facility or activity, through all potential exposure 
pathways 
 
potential effects of noise generated from the facility or activity on human receptors 
within the study area(s) 
C.8 
Indigenous land and resource use 
The licensee should identify any change that the facility or activity is likely to cause in the 
environment and any effect of any such change on the health and socio-economic conditions, 
physical and cultural heritage and on the current use of lands and resources for traditional 
purposes by any Indigenous group including effects on hunting, trapping, fishing and gathering. 
The licensee should identify any concerns raised by Indigenous people about the facility or 
activity in relation to any Indigenous or treaty rights.
