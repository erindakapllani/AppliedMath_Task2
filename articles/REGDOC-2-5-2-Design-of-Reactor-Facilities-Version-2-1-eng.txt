Preface 
This regulatory document is part of the CNSC’s physical design series of regulatory documents, which 
also covers design of uranium mines and mills, design of fixed radiography installations, design of 
nuclear substance laboratories and nuclear medicine rooms, and exposure devices. The full list of 
regulatory document series is included at the end of this document and can be found on the 
CNSC’s website. 
REGDOC-2.5.2, Design of Reactor Facilities, sets out requirements and guidance for new licence 
applications for water-cooled reactor facilities. It establishes a set of comprehensive design requirements 
and guidance that are risk informed and align with accepted international codes and practices. 
This document provides criteria pertaining to the safe design of new water-cooled reactor facilities. All 
aspects of the design are taken into account, and multiple levels of defence are promoted in design 
considerations. To the extent practicable, the requirements and guidance provided herein are technology 
neutral with respect to water-cooled reactor facilities. An applicant or licensee may put forward a case to 
demonstrate that the intent of a requirement is addressed by other means and demonstrated with 
supportable evidence. 
REGDOC-2.5.2, Design of Reactor Facilities, Version 2.1, supersedes both REGDOC-2.5.2, Design of 
Reactor Facilities: Nuclear Power Plants, which was published in May 2014, and RD-367, Design of 
Small Reactor Facilities, which was published in June 2011. 
To a large degree, this regulatory document represents the CNSC’s adoption of the principles set forth by 
the International Atomic Energy Agency in SSR-2/1, Safety of Nuclear Power Plants: Design, as adapted 
to align with Canadian requirements. 
This regulatory document considers all licensing phases, as information from the design process feeds 
into the processes for reviewing an application for a licence to construct a water-cooled reactor facility, 
and other licence applications. 
For proposed new facilities: This document will be used to assess new licence applications for reactor 
facilities. 
For existing facilities1: The requirements contained in this document do not apply unless they have been 
included, in whole or in part, in the licensing basis. 
Guidance contained in this document exists to inform the applicant, to elaborate on requirements, or to 
provide direction to licensees and applicants on how to meet requirements. It also provides more 
information about how CNSC staff evaluate specific problems or data during their review of licence 
applications. Licensees are expected to review and consider this guidance; if they choose not to follow it, 
they should explain how their selected approach still meets regulatory requirements. 
For information on the implementation of regulatory documents and on the graded approach, see 
REGDOC-3.5.3, Regulatory Fundamentals.

Design of Reactor Facilities 
1. 
Introduction 
1.1 
Purpose 
This regulatory document sets out the requirements of the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission 
(CNSC) for the design of new water-cooled reactor facilities. It establishes a set of comprehensive 
design requirements and guidance that are risk-informed and align with accepted national and 
international codes and practices. 
1.2 
Scope 
This regulatory document deals with a wide variety of topics related to the design of new reactor 
facilities. To the extent practicable, this document is technology-neutral with respect to water-cooled 
reactor facilities, and includes requirements and guidance for: 
1. establishing the safety goals and objectives for the design 
2. utilizing safety principles in the design 
3. applying safety management principles 
4. designing structures, systems and components (SSCs) 
5. interfacing engineering aspects, plant features and facility layout 
6. integrating safety assessments into the design process 
To a large degree, this document represents the CNSC’s adoption of the principles set forth in the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) document SSR-2/1, Safety of Nuclear Power Plants: 
Design, and the adaptation of those principles to align with Canadian practices. 
It is recognized that specific technologies may use alternative approaches. If a design other than a 
water-cooled reactor is to be considered for licensing in Canada, the design is subject to the safety 
objectives, high-level safety concepts and safety management requirements associated with this 
regulatory document. However, the CNSC will review such designs on a case-by-case basis. 
When an applicant proposes to construct more than 1 reactor on a site, the design of the multi-reactor 
site shall meet the safety objectives in this regulatory document.  
Conventional industrial safety is addressed only from a high-level perspective, with a focus on design 
requirements that are related to nuclear safety. 
1.3 
Relevant legislation 
The following provisions of the Nuclear Safety and Control Act (NSCA) and the regulations under it 
are relevant to this document: 
• 
NSCA, subsection 24(4) and 24(5) 
• 
General Nuclear Safety and Control Regulations (GNSCR), paragraphs 3(1)(i), 12(1)(f) 
• 
Class I Nuclear Facilities Regulations, paragraphs 3(b), 5(a), (d), (e), (f), (i) (k) and 6(a), (b), (h), 
(j), (k) and 7(f) 
• 
Other sections of the Class I Nuclear Facilities Regulations, as well as sections of the Radiation 
Protection Regulations and the Nuclear Security Regulations that pertain to the design of a new 
reactor facility 
May 2023 
REGDOC-2.5.2, Design of Reactor Facilities, Version 2.1

2. 
Safety objectives and concepts 
The safety objectives and concepts described in this section apply to a reactor facility during operation 
or during an accident. 
Four common plant states are defined: normal operation, anticipated operational occurrence (AOO), 
design-basis accident (DBA), and beyond-design-basis accident (BDBA). This document also 
introduces the plant state “design extension conditions” (DECs), as a subset of BDBAs that are 
considered in the plant design. 
2.1 
General nuclear safety objective 
In support of the NSCA and its associated regulations, the CNSC endorses the objective established by 
the IAEA that reactor facilities be designed and operated in a manner that will protect individuals, 
society and the environment from harm. This objective relies on the establishment and maintenance of 
effective defences against radiological hazards in reactor facilities. 
The general nuclear safety objective is supported by 3 complementary safety objectives, which deal 
with radiation protection, the technical aspects of the design, and environmental protection. The 
technical safety objective is interdependent with administrative and procedural measures that are taken 
to ensure defence against hazards due to ionizing radiation. 
2.1.1 
Radiation protection objective 
The radiation protection objective is to ensure that during normal operation, or during anticipated 
operational occurrences, radiation exposures within the reactor facility or due to any planned release of 
radioactive material from the reactor facility are kept below prescribed limits and as low as reasonably 
achievable (ALARA). 
Provisions shall be made for the mitigation of the radiological consequences of any accidents 
considered in the design. 
2.1.2 
Technical safety objectives 
The technical safety objectives are to provide all reasonably practicable measures to prevent accidents 
in the reactor facility, and to mitigate the consequences of accidents if they do occur. This takes into 
account all possible accidents considered in the design, including those of very low probability. 
When these objectives are achieved, any radiological consequences will be below prescribed limits, and 
the likelihood of accidents with serious radiological consequences will be extremely low. 
2.1.3 
Environmental protection objective 
The environmental protection objective is to provide all reasonably practical mitigation measures to 
protect the environment during the operation of a reactor facility and to mitigate the consequences of an 
accident. 
The design shall include provisions to control, treat and monitor releases to the environment and shall 
minimize the generation of radioactive and hazardous wastes.

2.2 
Application of the technical safety objectives 
The NSCA and the technical safety objectives provide the basis for the following criteria and goals: 
1. dose acceptance criteria 
2. safety goals 
Safety analyses shall be performed to confirm that these criteria and goals are met, to demonstrate 
effectiveness of measures for preventing accidents and mitigating radiological consequences of 
accidents if they do occur. 
2.2.1 
Dose acceptance criteria 
The acceptance criteria for normal operations are provided in section 4.4. 
The committed whole-body dose for average members of the critical groups who are most at risk, at or 
beyond the site boundary, shall be calculated in the deterministic safety analysis for a period of 30 days 
after the analyzed event. 
This dose shall be less than or equal to the dose acceptance criteria of: 
1. 0.5 millisievert (mSv) for any AOO or 
2. 20 mSv for any DBA 
The values adopted for the dose acceptance criteria for AOOs and DBAs are consistent with accepted 
international practices, and take into account the recommendations of the IAEA and the International 
Commission on Radiological Protection. 
2.2.2 
Safety goals 
Qualitative safety goals 
A limit is placed on the societal risks posed by reactor facility operation. For this purpose, the following 
2 qualitative safety goals have been established: 
Individual members of the public shall be provided a level of protection from the consequences of 
reactor facility operation, such that there is no significant additional risk to the life and health of 
individuals. 
Societal risks to life and health from reactor facility operation shall be comparable to or less than the 
risks of generating electricity by viable competing technologies, and shall not significantly add to other 
societal risks. 
Quantitative application of safety goals 
For practical application, the following 3 quantitative safety goals have been established so as to 
achieve the intent of the qualitative safety goals: 
1. core damage frequency 
2. small release frequency 
3. large release frequency 
May 2023 
REGDOC-2.5.2, Design of Reactor Facilities, Version 2.1 
11 
 
A core damage accident results from a postulated initiating event (PIE) followed by the failure of 1 or 
more safety system(s) or safety support system(s). Core damage frequency is a measure of the plant’s 
accident prevention capabilities. 
Small release frequency and large release frequency are measures of the plant’s accident mitigation 
capabilities. They also represent measures of risk to society and to the environment due to the operation 
of reactor facilities. 
Core damage frequency 
The sum of frequencies of all event sequences that can lead to significant core degradation shall be less 
than 10-5 per reactor year. 
Small release frequency 
The sum of frequencies of all event sequences that can lead to any release to the environment that 
requires temporary evacuation of the local population or a release to the environment of more than 1015 
becquerels of iodine-131 shall be less than 10-5 per reactor year.  
Large release frequency 
The sum of frequencies of all event sequences that can lead to any release to the environment that 
requires long-term relocation of the population or a release to the environment of more than 
1014 becquerels of cesium-137 shall be less than 10-6 per reactor year. 
Guidance 
A comprehensive probabilistic safety assessment (PSA) considers the probability, progression and 
consequences of equipment failures or transient conditions, to derive numerical estimates for the safety 
of the plant. Core damage frequency is determined by a Level 1 PSA, which identifies and quantifies 
the sequence of events that may lead to significant core degradation. The small release frequency and 
large release frequency are determined by a Level 2 PSA, which starts from the results of a 
Level 1 PSA, analyzes the containment behaviour, evaluates the radionuclides released from the failed 
fuel, and quantifies the releases to the environment. An exemption from performing a Level 2 PSA is 
granted if it is shown that core damage frequency in the Level 1 PSA is sufficiently low (i.e., less than 
the large release frequency limit). 
Calculations of the safety goals include all internal and external events as per REGDOC-2.4.2, 
Probabilistic Safety Assessment (PSA) for Nuclear Power Plants [1]. However, aggregation of internal 
events and other hazard risk metrics performed through simple addition to demonstrate that the risk 
metrics (core damage frequency, small release frequency and large release frequency) are not exceeded 
might not be appropriate. It is recognized that when the risk metrics for external events are 
conservatively estimated, their summation with the risk metrics for internal events can lead to 
misinterpretation. Should the aggregated total exceed the safety goals, conclusions should not be 
derived from the aggregated total until the scope of the conservative bias in the other hazards is 
investigated. 
Further details on PSAs are contained in section 7.5 of this document and REGDOC-2.4.2. 
2.2.3 
Safety analyses 
To demonstrate achievement of the safety objectives, a comprehensive hazard analysis, a deterministic 
safety analysis, and a probabilistic safety assessment shall be carried out. These analyses shall identify 
May 2023 
REGDOC-2.5.2, Design of Reactor Facilities, Version 2.1 
12 
 
all sources of exposure in order to evaluate potential radiation doses to workers at the plant and to the 
public, and to evaluate potential effects on the environment. 
The safety analyses shall examine plant performance for: 
1. normal operation 
2. AOOs 
3. DBAs 
4. BDBAs, including DECs (DECs could include severe accident conditions) 
Based on these analyses, the capability of the design to withstand PIEs and accidents shall be 
confirmed, the effectiveness of the items important to safety demonstrated, and requirements for 
emergency response established. The results of the safety analyses shall be fed back into the design. 
The safety analyses are discussed in further detail in section 7.0. 
2.2.4 
Accident mitigation and management 
The design shall include provisions to limit radiation exposure in normal operation and AOOs to 
ALARA levels, and to minimize the likelihood of an accident that could lead to the loss of normal 
control of the source of radiation. However, given that there is a remaining probability that an accident 
may occur, measures shall be taken to mitigate the radiological consequences of accidents. 
These measures shall include: 
1. consideration of inherent safety features 
2. incorporation of engineered design features 
3. onsite accident management procedures established by the operating organization 
4. establishment of offsite intervention measures by responsible authorities 
The design shall apply the principle that plant states that could result in high radiation doses or 
radioactive releases have a very low frequency of occurrence, and that plant states with significant 
frequency of occurrence have only minimal – if any – potential radiological consequences. 
The design shall facilitate the clear transfer of control between procedures for operational states, 
accident conditions, severe accident management and onsite emergency response.

2.3 
Safety concepts 
2.3.1 
Defence in depth 
The concept of defence in depth shall be applied to all organizational, behavioural, and design-related 
safety and security activities to ensure that they are subject to overlapping provisions. The levels of 
defence in depth shall be independent to the extent practicable. 
If a failure were to occur, the defence-in-depth approach allows the failure to be detected, and to be 
compensated for or corrected. 
This concept shall be applied throughout the design process and operation of the plant to provide a 
series of levels of defence aimed at preventing accidents and ensuring appropriate protection in the 
event that prevention fails. 
The design shall provide all of the following 5 levels of defence during normal operation; however, 
some relaxations may be specified for certain shutdown states. These levels are introduced in general 
terms below and are discussed in greater detail in section 4.1. 
Level 1 
The aim of the first level of defence is to prevent deviations from normal operation, and to prevent 
failures of SSCs important to safety. 
Level 2 
The aim of the second level of defence is to detect and intercept deviations from normal operation in 
order to prevent AOOs from escalating to accident conditions and to return the plant to a state of normal 
operation. 
Level 3 
The aim of the third level of defence is to minimize the consequences of accidents by providing 
inherent safety features, fail-safe design, additional equipment and mitigating procedures. 
Level 4 
The aim of the fourth level of defence is to ensure that radioactive releases caused by severe accidents 
are kept as low as practicable. 
Level 5 
The aim of the fifth level of defence is to mitigate the radiological consequences of potential releases of 
radioactive materials that may result from accident conditions. 
Section 4.1 discusses the application of levels of defence in further detail.

2.3.2 
Physical barriers 
An important aspect of implementing defence in depth in the reactor facility design shall be the 
provision of a series of physical barriers to confine radioactive material at specified locations. Physical 
barriers are discussed in further detail in section 4.1.1. 
2.3.3 
Operational limits and conditions 
Operational limits and conditions (OLCs) are the set of limits and conditions that can be monitored by 
or on behalf of the operator and that can be controlled by the operator. 
OLCs shall be established to ensure that plants operate in accordance with design assumptions and 
intent (parameters and components), and include the limits within which the facility has been shown to 
be safe. OLCs shall be documented in a manner that is readily accessible for control room personnel, 
with the roles and responsibilities clearly identified. Some OLCs may include combinations of 
automatic functions and actions by personnel. 
OLCs shall include: 
1. safety limits 
2. limiting safety system settings 
3. OLCs for normal operation and AOOs, including shutdown states 
4. control system constraints and procedural constraints on process variables and other important 
parameters 
5. requirements for surveillance, maintenance, testing and inspection of the plant to ensure that SSCs 
function as intended in the design and comply with the requirement for optimization by keeping 
radiation exposures ALARA, as per the Radiation Protection Regulations 
6. specified operating configurations, including operational restrictions in the event of the 
unavailability of SSCs important to safety 
7. action statements, including completion times for actions in response to deviations from the 
operational limits and conditions 
The basis on which the OLCs are derived shall be readily available in order to facilitate the ability of 
plant personnel to interpret, observe and apply the OLCs. 
Guidance 
The approaches and terminologies used for OLCs may vary as a result of the practices and regulatory 
systems that have been established in the country of origin for the plant’s design. 
Regardless of the approaches and terminologies used, the design authority should provide clear 
definitions of OLC terminology. The design should also include clear objectives and goals for the 
OLCs. 
The information related to OLCs should list the relevant standards (national or international) used, and 
document how the requirements from these standards have been met. 
OLCs should be defined for a suitable set of bounding plant operating configurations, and be based on 
the final design of the plant.

responsibility for the design. Prior to plant start-up, this authority shall be transferred to the operating 
organization. 
The design authority may assign responsibility for the design of specific parts of the plant to other 
organizations, known as responsible designers. The tasks and functions of the design authority and any 
responsible designer shall be established in formal documentation; however, the overall responsibility 
remains with the design authority.

for the design: 
1. established a knowledge base of all relevant aspects of the plant design and kept it up to date, while 
taking experience and research findings into account 
2. ensured the availability of the design information that is needed for safe plant operation and 
maintenance 
3. established the requisite security provisions in accordance with the Nuclear Security Regulations 
and associated regulatory documents 
4. maintained design configuration control 
5. reviewed, verified, approved and documented design changes 
6. established and controlled the necessary interfaces with responsible designers or other suppliers 
engaged in design work 
7. ensured that the necessary engineering and scientific skills and knowledge have been maintained

Design management 
Appropriate design management shall achieve the following objectives: 
1. SSCs important to safety meet their respective design requirements. 
2. Due account is taken of the human capabilities and limitations of personnel. 
3. Safety design information - necessary for safe operation and maintenance of the plant and for any 
subsequent plant modifications - is preserved. 
4. OLCs are provided for incorporation into the plant administrative and operational procedures. 
5. The plant design facilitates maintenance and aging management throughout the life of the plant. 
6. The results of the hazard analysis, deterministic safety analysis and probabilistic safety assessment 
are taken into account. 
7. Due consideration is given to the prevention of accidents and mitigation of their consequences. 
8. The generation of radioactive and hazardous waste is limited to minimum practicable levels, in 
terms of both activity and volume. 
9. A change control process is established to track design changes in order to provide configuration 
management during manufacturing, construction, commissioning and operation. 
10. Physical protection systems and cyber security programs are provided to address design-basis 
threats. 
3.3 
Design control measures 
Processes, procedures and practices shall be established as part of the overall management system so as 
to achieve the design objectives. This shall include identifying all performance and assessment 
parameters for the plant design, as well as detailed plans for each SSC, in order to ensure consistent 
quality of the design and the selected components. 
The design controls shall be such that the initial design, and any subsequent change or safety 
improvement, is carried out in accordance with established processes and procedures, which call on 
appropriate standards and codes and address applicable requirements and design bases. 
Appropriate design control measures shall also facilitate identification and control of design interfaces. 
The adequacy of the design, including design tools and design inputs and outputs, shall be verified or 
validated by individuals or groups that are independent from those who originally performed the work. 
Verifications, validations, and approvals shall be completed before the detailed design is implemented. 
The computer software used for design and analysis calculations shall be qualified in accordance with 
applicable standards. 
Guidance 
Design control measures, in the form of processes, procedures and practices, include: 
• 
design initiation, including identification of scope 
• 
work control and planning of design activities 
• 
selection of competent staff 
• 
identification and control of design inputs 
• 
establishment of design requirements 
• 
evaluation of design concepts and selection of preferred concept

CSA N286, Management system requirements for nuclear facilities [9], is the Canadian standard 
identifying management system requirements for the design, purchasing, construction, installation, 
commissioning, operating, and decommissioning of reactor facilities. CSA N286.7, Quality 
assurance of analytical, scientific, and design computer programs [13], and CSA N286.7, Quality 
Assurance of Analytical, Scientific and Design Computer Programs for Nuclear Power Plants [14], 
provide complementary requirements and guidance for analytical, scientific and design computer 
programs. 
Organizations from nations not using the aforementioned documents should identify the codes, 
standards, and specifications on which their design and safety analysis control measures are based, 
whether national or international – such as IAEA GS-G-3.5, The Management System for Nuclear 
Installations Safety Guide, referenced publications, and ISO 9001:2008 Quality Management Systems – 
Requirements [10]. Such control measures should be mapped to the requisite CSA N286 clauses to 
demonstrate that they satisfy Canadian requirements. Where gaps are identified, the measures to 
address them should be described. 
Organizational processes and procedures can be specific to design and safety analysis, or be part of an 
overall management system (or quality assurance program) for other reactor facility lifecycle activities. 
In the latter case, the organization should identify those processes and procedures applicable to design 
and safety analysis. 
There are no specific platforms, styles or format requirements for documenting design control 
measures; however, design organizations should identify the types of documents, the style, the format 
and the media (paper-based, electronic or Web-based) they intend to use to control their design 
activities.

Proven engineering practices 
The design authority shall identify the modern codes and standards that will be used for the plant 
design, and evaluate those codes and standards for applicability, adequacy, and sufficiency to the design 
of SSCs important to safety. 
May 2023 
REGDOC-2.5.2, Design of Reactor Facilities, Version 2.1 
19 
 
Where needed, codes and standards shall be supplemented to ensure that the final quality of the design 
is commensurate with the necessary safety functions. 
SSCs important to safety shall be of proven design, and shall be designed according to the standards 
and codes identified for the reactor facility. 
When a new SSC design, feature or engineering practice is introduced, adequate safety shall be 
demonstrated by a combination of supporting research and development programs and by examination 
of relevant experience from similar applications. An adequate qualification program shall be established 
to verify that the new design meets all applicable safety requirements. New designs shall be tested 
before being brought into service and shall be monitored while in service so as to verify that the 
expected behaviour is achieved. 
The design authority shall establish an adequate qualification program to verify that the new design 
meets all applicable design safety requirements. 
In the selection of equipment, due attention shall be given to spurious operation and to unsafe failure 
modes (e.g., failure to trip when necessary). Where the design has to accommodate an SSC failure, 
preference shall be given to equipment that exhibits known and predictable modes of failure, and that 
facilitates repair or replacement. 
3.5 
Operational experience and safety research 
The reactor facility design shall draw on operational experience that has been gained in the nuclear 
industry, and on the results of relevant research programs. 
Guidance 
The design authority should describe the major design features, changes and improvements that have 
been incorporated as a result of operational experience and safety research, including:

3.6 
Safety assessment 
Safety assessment is a systematic process applied throughout the design phase to ensure that the design 
meets all relevant safety requirements. The safety assessment for the design shall include the 
requirements set by the operating organization and by regulatory authorities. The basis for the safety 
assessment shall be the data derived from the safety analysis, previous operational experience, results of 
supporting research, and proven engineering practices. 
The safety assessment shall be part of the design process, with iteration between the design and 
analyses, and shall increase in scope and level of detail as the design process progresses. 
Before the design is submitted, an independent peer review of the safety assessment shall be conducted 
by individuals or groups separate from those carrying out the design. 
Safety assessment documentation shall identify those aspects of operation, maintenance and 
management that are important to safety. This documentation shall be maintained in a dynamic suite of 
documents, to reflect changes in design as the plant evolves. 
Safety assessment documentation shall be presented clearly and concisely, in a logical and 
understandable format, and shall be made readily accessible to designers, operators and the CNSC. 
Guidance 
As per IAEA GSR Part 4, Safety Assessment for Facilities and Activities [18], aspects considered in the 
safety assessment should include: 
• 
defence in depth 
• 
safety margins 
• 
multiple barriers

Safety requirements 
4.1 
Application of defence in depth 
The design of a reactor facility shall incorporate defence in depth. The levels of defence in depth shall 
be independent to the extent practicable. 
Defence in depth shall be achieved at the design phase through the application of design provisions 
specific to the 5 levels of defence. 
Level 1 
Achievement of Level 1 defence in depth shall include conservative design and high-quality 
construction to provide confidence that plant failures and deviations from normal operations are 
minimized and accidents are prevented. 
May 2023 
REGDOC-2.5.2, Design of Reactor Facilities, Version 2.1 
22 
 
This shall entail careful attention to selection of appropriate design codes and materials, design 
procedures, equipment qualification, control of component fabrication and plant construction, and use 
of operational experience. 
Level 2 
Level 2 shall be achieved by controlling plant behaviour during and following a postulated initiating 
event (PIE) using both inherent and engineered design features to minimize or exclude uncontrolled 
transients to the extent possible. 
Level 3 
Achievement of Level 3 defence in depth shall include the provision of inherent safety features, fail-
safe design, engineered design features, and procedures that minimize the consequences of DBAs. 
These provisions shall be capable of leading the plant first to a controlled state, and then to a safe 
shutdown state, and maintaining at least 1 barrier for the confinement of radioactive material. 
Automatic activation of the engineered design features shall minimize the need for operator actions in 
the early phase of a DBA. 
Level 4 
Level 4 shall be achieved by providing equipment and procedures to manage accidents and mitigate 
their consequences as far as practicable. 
Most importantly, adequate protection shall be provided for the confinement function by way of a 
robust containment design. This includes the use of complementary design features to prevent accident 
progression and to mitigate the consequences of DECs. The confinement function shall be further 
protected by severe accident management procedures. 
Level 5 
The design shall provide adequately equipped emergency support facilities, and plans for onsite and 
offsite emergency response. 
Guidance 
IAEA INSAG-10, Defence in Depth in Nuclear Safety, provides information regarding the concept and 
application of defence in depth [5]. 
Guidance on performing a systematic assessment of the defence in depth can be obtained from the 
IAEA safety reports series No. 46, Assessment of Defence in Depth for Nuclear Power Plants. 
The application of defence in depth in the design should ensure the following: 
• 
The approach to defence in depth used in the design should ensure that all aspects of design at the 
SSCs level have been covered, with emphasis on SSCs that are important to safety. 
• 
The defence in depth should not be significantly degraded if the SSC has multiple functions (e.g., 
for CANDU reactors, the moderator and end-shield cooling systems may serve the functions of a 
process system and include the functions of mitigating DECs). 
• 
The principle of multiple physical barriers to the release of radioactive material should be 
incorporated in the design; there should be a limited number of cases where there is a reduction in 
the number of physical barriers (as may be the case where some components carrying radioactive 
May 2023 
REGDOC-2.5.2, Design of Reactor Facilities, Version 2.1 
23 
 
material serve the function of primary coolant barrier and containment), and adequate justification 
should exist for such design choices. 
• 
The design (e.g., in safety design guides, management system programs) should provide: 
• 
levels of defence in depth that are addressed by individual SSCs 
• 
supporting analysis and calculation 
• 
evaluation of operating procedures 
• 
The safety analysis should demonstrate that the challenges to the physical barriers do not exceed 
their physical capacity. 
• 
The structure for defence in depth provisions at each level of defence should be established for a 
given plant design, and the evaluation of the design from the point of view of maintaining each 
safety function should be carried out. This evaluation should consider each and every one of the 
provisions for mitigation of a given challenge mechanism, and confirm that it is well founded, 
sufficient, feasible, and correctly engineered within the design. 
• 
Special attention should be paid to the feasibility of a given provision and the existence of 
supporting safety analyses. Deficiencies in the completeness of the supporting safety analyses 
should be documented and flagged as issues to be queried. 
To ensure that different levels of defence are independently effective, any design features that aim to 
prevent an accident should not belong to the same level of defence as design features that aim to 
mitigate the consequences of the accident. 
The independence between all levels of defence should be achieved, in particular, through diverse 
provisions. The strengthening of each of these levels separately would provide, as far as reasonably 
achievable, an overall reinforcement of defence in depth. For example, the use of dedicated systems to 
deal with DECs ensures the independence of the fourth defence level. 
4.1.1 
Physical barriers 
To ensure that the overall safety concept of defence in depth is maintained, the design shall provide 
multiple physical barriers to the uncontrolled release of radioactive materials to the environment. Such 
barriers shall include the fuel matrix, the fuel cladding, the reactor coolant pressure boundary, and the 
containment. In addition, the design shall provide for an exclusion zone. 
To the extent practicable, the design shall prevent: 
1. challenges to the integrity of physical barriers 
2. failure of a barrier when challenged 
3. failure of a barrier as a consequence of failure of another barrier 
4. the possibility of failure of engineered barriers from errors in operation and maintenance that could 
result in harmful consequences 
 
The design shall also allow for the fact that the existence of multiple levels of defence does not 
normally represent a sufficient basis for continued power operation in the absence of 1 defence level. 
4.2 
Safety functions 
The reactor facility design shall provide adequate means to: 
1. maintain the plant in a normal operational state 
2. ensure the proper short-term response immediately following a PIE 
3. facilitate the management of the plant in and following DBAs and DECs 
May 2023 
REGDOC-2.5.2, Design of Reactor Facilities, Version 2.1 
24 
 
The following fundamental safety functions shall be available in operational states, DBAs and DECs, 
except where the postulated accident involves a loss of that function: 
1. control of reactivity 
2. removal of heat from the fuel 
3. confinement of radioactive material 
4. shielding against radiation 
5. control of operational discharges and hazardous substances, as well as limitation of accidental 
releases 
6. monitoring of safety-critical parameters to guide operator actions 
These safety functions shall apply to the reactor as well as fuel storage and handling. 
SSCs necessary to fulfill safety functions following a PIE shall be identified. This approach shall 
identify the need for such functions as reactor shutdown, emergency core cooling, containment, 
emergency heat removal and power systems. 
4.3 
Accident prevention and plant safety characteristics 
The design shall apply the principles of defence in depth to minimize sensitivity to PIEs. Following a 
PIE, the plant is rendered safe by: 
1. inherent safety features 
2. passive safety features 
3. specified procedural actions 
4. action of control systems 
5. action of safety systems 
6. action of complementary design features 
4.4 
Radiation protection and acceptance criteria 
Achievement of the general nuclear safety objective (discussed in section 2.1) depends on all actual and 
potential sources of radiation being identified, and on provision being made to ensure that sources are 
kept under strict technical and administrative control. 
Radiation doses to the public and to site personnel shall be as low as reasonably achievable. During 
normal operation, including maintenance and decommissioning, doses shall be regulated by the limits 
prescribed in the Radiation Protection Regulations. 
The design shall include provisions for the prevention and mitigation of radiation exposures resulting 
from DBAs and DECs. 
The design shall also ensure that potential radiation doses to the public from AOOs and DBAs do not 
exceed dose acceptance criteria provided in section 2.2.1. The calculated overall risk to the public shall 
meet the safety goals in section 2.2.2. 
Guidance 
A detailed radiation dose assessment should include estimated annual collective and individual effective 
and equivalent radiation doses to site personnel and members of the public for normal operation, 
potential radiation doses to the public for AOOs and DBAs, and potential releases into the environment 
for DECs. 
May 2023 
REGDOC-2.5.2, Design of Reactor Facilities, Version 2.1 
25 
 
The assessment process should be clearly documented and should include the process for consideration 
and evaluation of dose-reduction changes in the reactor facility design. Radiation doses resulting from 
the operation of the reactor facility should be reduced by means of engineered controls and radiation 
protection measures to levels such that any further expenditure on design, construction and operational 
measures would not be warranted by the expected reduction in radiation doses. 
The radiation dose assessment should include the expected occupancy of the reactor facility’s radiation 
areas, along with estimated annual person-Sievert doses associated with major functions, including 
radioactive waste handling, normal maintenance, special maintenance, refuelling and in-service 
inspection. Such assessments should include information as to how ALARA and operating experience 
are used in the design to deal with dose-significant contributors.

4.5 
Exclusion zone 
The design shall include adequate provision for an appropriate exclusion zone. The appropriateness of 
the exclusion zone shall be based on several factors, including: 
1. evacuation needs 
2. land usage needs 
3. security requirements 
4. environmental factors 
Guidance 
The exclusion zone for reactor facilities in Canada has been typically defined as 914 metres from the 
reactor building. Rather than prescribe a particular size for the exclusion zone, this regulatory document 
specifies factors that must be considered in establishing an appropriate size, including evacuation needs, 
land usage needs, security requirements and environmental factors. 
Evacuation needs 
The design should take into account emergency response requirements based on the size of the 
exclusion zone and the facilities and infrastructures that are within the zone. 
The exclusion zone boundary should be defined with consideration for the capabilities of onsite and 
offsite emergency response. Environmental factors that can affect the response times should be taken 
into consideration. The design also considers projected changes over time in land use and population 
density, which could adversely affect response times, or the ability to shelter or evacuate persons from 
both the site itself and associated emergency planning regions. 
Evacuation needs are generally based on existing provincial nuclear emergency response plans. 
 
 
May 2023 
REGDOC-2.5.2, Design of Reactor Facilities, Version 2.1 
26 
 
Land usage needs 
The design should ensure that the exclusion zone is large enough to accommodate the site for the 
nuclear plant (accounting for the full number of units postulated to be built at the site, whether or not 
they would be built immediately). 
The design activities should seek to optimize land usage by the plant as part of determining the 
exclusion zone. 
Security requirements 
The design should provide security requirements based on the size of the exclusion zone, the facilities 
and infrastructures that are within the zone, and the design of the facility. Generally, a larger exclusion 
zone would require more security capabilities, in order to avoid a longer response time. Physical 
characteristics of the site itself (which include geographical characteristics, such as proximity to 
elevated land) also play a role in determining these requirements. 
The design authority may decide to mitigate these risks while maintaining a smaller exclusion zone by 
choosing highly robust facility designs, applying engineered security measures to the site, and having a 
well-designed security program. These engineered measures should be described. 
In establishing the radius of the exclusion zone boundary, the design should take into account: 
• 
the site selection and threat assessment report 
• 
facility robustness against natural and human induced external hazards (including malevolent acts) 
• 
the capability of the onsite security program, along with any offsite security resources that will 
supplement the onsite security program 
In each of the above parameters, the design should take into account projected changes over time in 
land use and population density, which could adversely affect that parameter. The design should be 
such that the exclusion zone, as established at the design stage, will be sustainable for the full lifecycle 
of the facility. 
The acceptability of the information to be provided in support of the above is discussed in section 5.22 
of this document. 
Environmental factors 
Environmental factors that may have an impact on the size of the exclusion zone include local 
meteorological conditions that could affect the radiological dose received by members of the public. 
The design authority may use generic site data and conservative assumptions regarding meteorological 
conditions in the absence of a specific site. 
The Radiation Protection Regulations establish an effective dose limit of 1 mSv per year for members 
of the public. This limit implies that a hypothetical member of the public who lives at the exclusion 
zone boundary for 1 year (since no permanent dwelling is permitted within the exclusion zone) would 
not accumulate a dose of more than 1 mSv from normal operation of the reactor facility.

4.6 
Reactor facility layout 
The reactor facility layout shall take into account PIEs to enhance protection of SSCs important to 
safety. 
The design shall take into account the interfaces between the safety, security and safeguard provisions 
of the reactor facility and other aspects of the facility layout, such as: 
1. access routes for normal operational actions and maintenance 
2. access control to minimize radiation exposures 
3. actions taken in response to internal or external events 
4. egress routes 
5. movement of hazardous substances, nuclear materials, and radioactive materials 
6. movement of authorized and unauthorized personnel 
7. interaction of building and support functions 
It is likely that some design requirements associated with these factors will conflict with others in the 
determination of facility layout requirements. The design, therefore, shall reflect an assessment of 
options, demonstrating that an optimized configuration has been sought for the facility layout. 
4.6.1 
Requirements for multiple units 
The design shall take due account of challenges to multiple units at a site. Specifically, the risk 
associated with common-cause events affecting more than 1 unit at a time shall be considered. 
Guidance 
The presence of multiple units at a site or common-cause events could exacerbate challenges that the 
plant personnel would face during an accident. The events and consequences of an accident at 1 unit 
may affect the accident progression or hamper accident management activities at the neighbouring unit; 
available resources (personnel, equipment and consumable resources) would need to be shared among 
several units. These challenges should be identified and the available resources and mitigation strategies 
shown to be adequate. 
5. 
General design requirements 
5.1 
Safety classification of structures, systems and components 
The design authority shall classify SSCs using a consistent and clearly defined classification method. 
The SSCs shall then be designed, constructed, and maintained such that their quality and reliability is 
commensurate with this classification. 
In addition, all SSCs shall be identified as either important or not important to safety. The criteria for 
determining safety importance is based on: 
1. safety function(s) to be performed 
2. consequence(s) of failure 
3. probability that the SSC will be called upon to perform the safety function 
4. the time following a PIE at which the SSC will be called upon to operate, and the expected duration 
of that operation 
 
May 2023 
REGDOC-2.5.2, Design of Reactor Facilities, Version 2.1 
28 
 
SSCs important to safety shall include: 
1. safety systems 
2. complementary design features 
3. safety support systems 
4. other SSCs whose failure may lead to safety concerns (e.g., process and control systems) 
Appropriately designed interfaces shall be provided between SSCs of different classes in order to 
minimize the risk of having SSCs less important to safety adversely affect the function or reliability of 
SSCs of greater importance. 
Guidance 
The method for classifying the safety significance of SSCs should be based primarily on deterministic 
methodologies, complemented (where appropriate) by probabilistic methods and engineering judgment. 
The safety classification of SSCs should be an iterative process that continues throughout the design 
process. 
The SSC classification process should include the following activities: 
• 
review and definition of PIEs 
• 
grouping and identification of bounding PIEs 
• 
identification of plant-specific safety functions to prevent or mitigate the PIEs 
• 
safety categorization of the safety functions, in accordance with their safety significance and role in 
achieving fundamental safety functions 
• 
identification of SSCs that provide the safety functions 
• 
assignment of SSCs to a safety class corresponding to the safety category 
• 
verification of SSC classification 
• 
identification of engineering design rules for classified SSCs 
This approach should be used for all SSCs including pressure retaining components, electrical, 
instrumentation and control (I&C) and civil structures. 
The identified PIEs should be grouped into limiting cases, which are referred to as bounding or 
enveloping PIEs. Once these bounding PIEs are known and understood, the required safety functions 
can be identified. The number of categories and classes may be chosen to allow for graded design rules. 
The time following the PIE captures the need for automatic action for short timescales, or manual 
actions being acceptable for longer-term actions. The expected duration of the operation is also 
important since some systems may need to operate for months. Others (such as shutdown means) can 
complete their mission within seconds. 
The potential severity of the consequences of a function failure should be evaluated. The severity 
should be based on the consequences that could arise if the function was not performed. The 
consequences of a function failure should be determined assuming that the safety functions belonging to 
the subsequent level of defence in depth remain functional. 
Some specific SSCs classification guidelines are given below: 
• 
SSCs whose failure cannot be accepted because the failure will certainly result in unacceptable 
consequences should be allocated to the highest safety class. 
May 2023 
REGDOC-2.5.2, Design of Reactor Facilities, Version 2.1 
29 
 
• 
Supporting SSCs that are essential to achieve the safety function of the frontline SSCs to be 
supported should be assigned to the same class as that of the frontline SSCs. 
• 
An SSC that contributes to the performance of several safety functions of different categories 
should be assigned to the class corresponding to the highest category of those safety functions 
requiring the commensurate design rules. 
• 
Any SSC that is not part of a safety function group, but whose failure could adversely affect this 
safety function group in accomplishing its safety function (if this cannot be precluded by design) 
should be classified in accordance with the safety category of that safety function group. 
• 
Where the safety class of connecting or interacting SSCs is not the same (including cases where 1 
SSC belonging to a safety class is connected to another SSC not important to safety), the 
interference between the SSCs should be separated by a device (e.g., a physical or optical isolator) 
classified in the higher safety class. This is to ensure that the failure of a lower safety class SSC will 
not propagate to an SSC belonging to a higher safety class. 
The adequacy of the safety classification should be verified using deterministic safety analysis, which 
should cover all PIEs and all the credited safety functions. This verification should be complemented, 
as appropriate, by insight from probabilistic safety assessment and by engineering judgment. 
The appropriate design rules and limits as indicated in section 5.5 are specified in accordance with the 
safety class of SSCs. 
Although the probability of SSCs being called upon during DECs is very low, the failure of safety 
functions for the mitigation of DECs may lead to very severe consequences. SSCs that provide these 
safety functions should be assigned a safety category commensurate with the safety significance. For 
certain complementary design features (such as onsite portable equipment) with high redundancy and 
extremely low probability of being called upon, a low safety class may be appropriate. It should be 
noted that not all portable equipment is included in SSCs important to safety. 
Firstly, SSCs are identified as important or not important to safety. By virtue of their roles, safety 
systems, complementary design features and safety support systems will be identified as important to 
safety. Additionally, other SSCs that can have a significant impact on nuclear safety will also be 
identified as important to safety. 
After the SSCs important to safety are identified, they are classified. The safety classification considers 
a number of factors as listed above. The safety classification enables appropriate design rules to be 
selected as described in section 5.5. 
5.2 
Plant design envelope 
The design authority shall establish the plant design envelope, which comprises all plant states 
considered in the design: normal operation, AOOs, DBAs and DECs, as shown in figure 1.

The design basis shall specify the capabilities that are necessary for the plant in operational states and 
DBAs. 
Conservative design measures and sound engineering practices shall be applied in the design basis for 
operational states and DBAs. This will provide a high degree of assurance that no significant damage 
will occur to the reactor core, and that radiation doses will remain within established limits. 
Complementary design features address the performance of the plant in DECs. 
Guidance 
The design basis for each SSC important to safety should be systematically defined and justified. The 
design should also provide the necessary information for the operating organization to run the plant 
safely. 
The design should adopt deterministic design principles of appropriate conservatism. For example, 
SSCs should be robust, tolerant of a large spectrum of faults with a gradual degradation in their 
effectiveness, and should not fail catastrophically under operational states, DBAs and DECs. 
The conditions for deviating from conservative and deterministic design principles should be clearly 
stated, including the basis by which such deviation would be justified case by case; such a basis may 
include a more sophisticated calculation methodology that has been well established, or a multiplicity 
of ways in which a particular function can be fulfilled. 
A complementary design feature is a design feature added to the design as a stand-alone SSC (including 
portable equipment), or added capability to an existing SSC to cope with DECs. 
The design principles for complementary design features to deal with DECs do not necessarily need to 
incorporate the same degree of conservatism as those applied to the design up to and including DBAs. 
However, the design authority should provide reasonable assurance that the complementary design 
features will function as designed when called upon.

REGDOC-2.5.2, Design of Reactor Facilities, Version 2.1

5.3 
Plant states 
Plant states considered in the design shall be grouped into the following 4 categories: 
1. Normal operation is an operation within specified OLCs, including start-up, power operation, 
shutting down, shutdown, maintenance, testing, and refuelling. 
2. An anticipated operational occurrence (AOO) is a deviation from normal operation that is expected 
to occur once or several times during the operating lifetime of the reactor facility but that, in view 
of the appropriate design provisions, does not cause any significant damage to items important to 
safety, or lead to accident conditions. 
3. Design-basis accidents (DBAs) are accident conditions for which a reactor facility is designed 
according to established design criteria, and for which damage to the fuel and the release of 
radioactive material are kept within regulated limits. 
4. Design extension conditions (DECs) are a subset of beyond-design-basis accidents (BDBAs) that 
are considered in the design process of the facility in accordance with best-estimate methodology to 
keep releases of radioactive material within acceptable limits. DECs could include severe accidents. 
Acceptance criteria shall be assigned to each plant state considered in the design, taking into account 
the principle that frequent PIEs will have only minor or no radiological consequences, and that any 
events that may result in severe consequences will be of extremely low probability. 
Guidance 
Plant states considered in the design are divided into normal operation, AOOs, DBAs and DECs. The 
design requirements of SSCs should then be developed to ensure that the plant is capable of meeting 
applicable deterministic and probabilistic requirements for each plant state. Note that the plant states 
diagram in section 5.2 identifies BDBA as a plant state. However, only a subset of BDBAs is 
considered in the design. These are DECs. 
The design should include the following: 
• 
criteria for transition to normal operation following an AOO or DBA (e.g., the safety functions are 
provided, and the OLC limits for the operating configurations are met) 
• 
key parameters and characteristics for operational states, including nominal values and deviations 
due to uncertainties and settings of instruments, controls, trips, equipment action time, or due to 
process fluctuations 
• 
permissible conditions for different operating configurations (e.g., cold and pressurized) including 
transient time (e.g., power level of reactor or turbine, normal planned power transient rate, heat-up 
and cool-down rates) for the reactor facility’s operating life 
• 
methods of transferring the plant between different operating configurations 
• 
final safe configurations after AOOs, DBAs, and DECs 
5.3.1 
Normal operation 
The design shall facilitate the safe operation of the plant within a defined range of parameters, with an 
assumed availability of a minimum set of specified support features for safety systems. 
The design shall minimize the unavailability of safety systems. It shall address the potential for 
accidents to occur when the availability of safety systems may be reduced, such as during shutdown, 
start-up, low power operation, refuelling and maintenance. 
 
May 2023 
REGDOC-2.5.2, Design of Reactor Facilities, Version 2.1 
32 
 
The design shall establish a set of requirements and limitations for safe normal operation, including: 
1. limits important to safety 
2. constraints on control systems and procedures 
3. plant maintenance, testing, and inspection requirements to ensure that SSCs function as intended, 
taking the ALARA principle into consideration 
4. clearly defined operating configurations, such as start-up, power production, shutdown, 
maintenance, testing, surveillance, and refuelling – these configurations shall include relevant 
operational restrictions in the event of safety system and safety support system outages 
These requirements and limitations, together with the results of safety analysis, shall form the basis for 
establishing the OLCs according to which the plant will be authorized to operate, as discussed in 
section 2.3.3 of this document. 
Guidance 
The design ensures that normal operations are carried out safely, thereby ensuring that radiation doses 
to workers and members of the public, as well as any planned discharges and releases of radioactive 
material from the plant, will be within the prescribed limits specified in the Radiation Protection 
Regulations, and will meet the requirements of section 2.1.1 of this regulatory document. 
Operating configurations for normal operation are addressed by the OLCs described in section 2.3.3. 
These typically include: 
• 
normal reactor start-up (from shutdown, through criticality, to full power) 
• 
power operation, including full-power and low-power operation 
• 
changes in reactor power, including load-follow modes (if applicable) and return to full-power after 
an extended period at low-power 
• 
operation during transition between configurations, such as reactor shutdown from power operation 
(hot shutdown, cool-down) 
• 
refuelling during normal operation, where applicable 
• 
shutdown in a refuelling mode or other maintenance condition that opens the reactor coolant or 
containment boundary 
• 
handling of fresh and irradiated fuel 
The key parameters and unique characteristics of each operational configuration, including the specific 
design provision for maintaining the configuration, should be identified. The permissible periods of 
operation at different configurations (e.g., power level) in the event of a deviation from normal 
operating configurations should also be identified. 
5.3.2 
Anticipated operational occurrences 
The design shall include provisions such that releases to the public following an AOO do not exceed the 
dose acceptance criterion provided in section 2.2.1. 
The design shall also provide that, to the extent practicable, SSCs not involved in the initiation of an 
AOO shall remain operable following the AOO. 
The response of the plant to a wide range of AOOs shall allow safe operation or shutdown, if necessary, 
without the need to invoke provisions beyond Level 1 defence in depth or, at most, Level 2. 
May 2023 
REGDOC-2.5.2, Design of Reactor Facilities, Version 2.1 
33 
 
The facility layout shall be such that equipment is placed at the most suitable location to ensure its 
immediate availability when operator intervention is required, allowing for safe and timely access 
during an AOO. 
Guidance 
The guidance in this subsection also covers elements common to AOO and DBA. 
In accordance with the requirements of section 2.3.1 of this regulatory document for Level 2 and 
Level 3 defence in depth, the design should include the results of the analyses of AOOs and DBAs in 
order to provide a demonstration of the robustness of the fault tolerance in the engineering design and 
the effectiveness of the safety systems. The analysis should cover the full range of events over the full 
range of reactor power. The analysis should also cover all normal operating configurations, including 
low-power and shutdown states. 
For a wide range of AOOs, the design should be such that any deviations from normal operation can be 
detected, and that the control systems can be expected to return the plant to a safe state, normally 
without the activation of safety systems. For both AOOs and DBAs, there should be high confidence 
that qualified systems (as identified in REGDOC-2.4.1, Deterministic Safety Analysis) can mitigate the 
event even when acting alone [20]. 
In the analysis of AOOs and DBAs for each group of PIEs, it may be sufficient to analyze only a 
limited number of bounding initiating events, which can represent a bounding response for a group of 
events. The rationale for the choice of these selected bounding events should be provided. The plant 
parameters that are important to the outcome of the safety analysis should also be identified. These 
parameters would typically include: 
• 
reactor power and its distribution 
• 
core component temperatures 
• 
fuel cladding oxidation and deformation 
• 
pressures in the primary and secondary systems 
• 
containment parameters 
• 
temperatures and flows 
• 
reactivity coefficients 
• 
reactor kinetics parameters 
• 
reactivity worth of reactivity devices 
Those characteristics of the safety systems, including the operating conditions in which the systems are 
actuated, the time delays, and the systems’ capacity after the actuation claimed in the design, should be 
specified and demonstrated to be consistent with the overall functional and performance requirements 
of the systems.

designed. 
May 2023 
REGDOC-2.5.2, Design of Reactor Facilities, Version 2.1 
34 
 
The design shall be such that releases to the public following a DBA will not exceed the dose 
acceptance criterion provided in section 2.2.1. 
In order to prevent progression to a more severe condition that may threaten the next barrier, the design 
shall include provisions to automatically initiate the necessary safety systems when prompt and reliable 
action is required in response to a PIE. 
Provision shall also be made to support timely detection of, and manual response to, conditions when 
prompt action is not necessary. This shall include responses such as manual initiation of systems or 
other operator actions. 
The design shall take into account operator actions that may be necessary to diagnose the state of the 
plant and to put it into a stable long-term shutdown condition in a timely manner. Such operator actions 
shall be facilitated by the provision of adequate instrumentation to monitor plant status, and controls for 
manual operation of equipment. 
Any equipment necessary for manual response and recovery processes shall be placed at the most 
suitable location to allow safe and timely worker access when needed. 
Guidance 
The design identifies the set of DBAs and associated conditions for which the reactor facility is 
designed. This includes such responses as manual initiation of systems or other operator actions. 
See also section 5.3.2 of this regulatory document for guidance common to AOOs and DBAs.

CNSC, REGDOC-2.4.1, Deterministic Safety Analysis, Ottawa, Canada [20] 
5.3.4 
Design extension conditions 
The design authority shall identify the set of design extension conditions (DECs) based on deterministic 
and probabilistic methods, operational experience, engineering judgment and the results of research and 
analysis. These DECs shall be used to further improve the safety of the reactor facility by enhancing the 
plant’s capabilities to withstand, without significant radiological releases, accidents that are either more 
severe than DBAs or that involve additional failures. 
The design shall be such that plant states that could lead to significant radioactive releases are 
practically eliminated. For plant states that are not practically eliminated, only protective measures that 
are of limited scope in terms of area and time shall be necessary for protection of the public, and 
sufficient time shall be made available to implement these measures. 
Complementary design features shall be provided to cope with DECs. Their design shall be based on a 
combination of phenomenological models, engineering judgment, and probabilistic methods. 
The rules and practices that have been applied to the complementary design features shall be identified. 
These rules and practices do not necessarily need to incorporate the same degree of conservatism as 
those applied to the design basis. 
May 2023 
REGDOC-2.5.2, Design of Reactor Facilities, Version 2.1 
35 
 
The design shall identify a radiological and combustible gas accident source term, for use in the 
specification of the complementary design features for DECs. This source term is referred to as the 
reference source term and shall be based on a set of representative core damage accidents established by 
the design authority. 
To the extent practicable, the design shall provide biological shielding of appropriate composition and 
thickness in order to protect operational personnel during DECs. 
In the case of plants with multiple units at a site, the use of available support from other units shall only 
be relied upon if the safe operation of the other units is not compromised. 
Guidance 
DECs are the subset of BDBAs that are considered in the design. BDBAs are all events less frequent 
than DBAs; there is no lower frequency bound. 
For identifying DECs, consideration should be given to: 
• 
factors of the accident progression (i.e., physical conditions, processes and phenomena) 
• 
BDBA (including severe accident) scenarios resulting from initiating events, human actions, and 
SSC operability (success or failure) 
• 
selection of bounding events that are considered in design and determination of limiting values and 
ranges of the parameters of these events 
The design should identify the features that are designed for use in, or that are capable of preventing or 
mitigating events considered in DECs. These features include complementary design features and other 
SSCs that may be credited for DECs. These features should: 
1. be independent, to the extent practicable, of those used in more frequent accidents 
2. have a reliability commensurate with the function that they are required to fulfill 
The choice of the DECs to be analyzed should be explained and justified, indicating whether it has been 
made on the basis of a PSA or other analysis that identifies potential vulnerabilities of the plant. 
For use in the specification of the complementary design features for DECs, the reference source term 
should be calculated for a set of representative accident scenarios based on the best-estimate models. 
This should take into account the uncertainties of key parameters and the possible changes in governing 
physical processes. 
Accidents in this category are, typically, sequences involving more than 1 failure (unless these are taken 
into account in the DBAs at the design stage). Such sequences may include DBAs with degraded 
performance of a safety system, and sequences that could lead to containment bypass. The analysis of 
those accidents may: 
• 
use best-estimate models and assumptions 
• 
take credit for realistic system action and performance beyond original intended functions, 
including the potential use of safety, non-safety and temporary systems 
• 
take credit for realistic operator actions 
Where this is not possible, reasonably conservative assumptions should be made in which the 
uncertainties in the understanding of the physical processes being modelled are considered. The 
analysis should justify the approach taken. 
May 2023 
REGDOC-2.5.2, Design of Reactor Facilities, Version 2.1 
36 
 
Accident conditions with a significant release are considered to have been practically eliminated: 
• 
if it is physically impossible for the condition to occur, or 
• 
if the condition can be considered with a high degree of confidence to be extremely unlikely to arise 
Physical impossibility can be demonstrated by a design feature that would preclude initiation or further 
progress of an accident scenario. Care should be taken when assumptions are used to support the 
demonstration. Such assumptions should be adequately acknowledged and addressed. 
To demonstrate practical elimination as extremely unlikely with a high degree of confidence, the 
following should be considered: 
• 
The degree of substantiation provided for the demonstration of practical elimination should take 
account of the assessed frequency of the situation to be eliminated and of the degree of confidence 
in the assessed frequency. 
• 
Practical elimination of an accident should not be claimed solely based on compliance with a 
probabilistic cut-off value. Even if the probability of an accident sequence is very low, any 
additional design features, operational measures or accident management procedures to lower the 
risk further should be implemented to the extent practicable. 
• 
The most stringent requirements for the demonstration of practical elimination should apply in the 
case of an event with the potential to lead directly to a severe accident – i.e., from Level 1 to Level 
4 for defence in depth. For example, demonstration of practical elimination of a heterogeneous 
boron dilution event in a pressurized water reactor (would require a detailed substantiation. 
• 
The necessary high confidence in low likelihood should, wherever possible, be supported by means 
such as: 
• 
multiple layers of protection 
• 
application of the safety principles of independence, diversity, separation, redundancy 
• 
use of passive safety features 
• 
use of multiple independent controls 
• 
It should be ensured that the practical elimination provisions remain in place and valid throughout 
the plant lifetime: for example, through in-service and periodic inspections. 
In each case, the demonstration should show sufficient knowledge of the accident sequence analyzed 
and of the phenomena involved, substantiated by relevant evidence. 
To minimize uncertainties and to increase the robustness of a plant’s safety case, demonstration of 
practical elimination should preferably rely on the criterion of physical impossibility, rather than the 
second probabilistic criterion (extreme unlikelihood with high confidence). 
Portable equipment should be classified based on its safety importance. 
There may be different options available to fulfill the fundamental safety functions during DECs. 
However, when called upon, the portable onsite or offsite equipment credited is expected to be effective 
with reasonable confidence. 
Portable onsite or offsite equipment may be one of the means for mitigation in support of the severe 
accident management guidelines.

5.3.5 
Severe accidents within design extension conditions 
The design shall be balanced such that no particular design feature or event makes a dominant 
contribution to the frequency of severe accidents, taking uncertainties into account. 
Early in the design process, the various potential barriers to core or fuel degradation shall be identified, 
and features that can be incorporated to halt core or fuel degradation at those barriers shall be provided. 
The design shall also identify the equipment to be used in the management of severe accidents, 
including equipment that is available onsite and offsite. 
The design shall include redundant connection points to provide for water and electrical power that may 
be needed to support severe accident management actions. 
Provisions for testing the equipment shall be provided to the extent practicable. 
A reasonable level of confidence that this equipment will perform as intended in the case of a severe 
accident shall be demonstrated by fire and seismic assessments, and consideration of environmental 
conditions. 
Consideration shall be given to the plant’s full design capabilities, including the possible use of safety, 
non-safety, and temporary systems, beyond their originally intended function. This shall apply to any 
system that can be shown with a reasonable degree of assurance to be able to function in the 
environmental conditions expected during a severe accident. 
For DECs with severe core damage, the containment shall maintain its role as a leak-tight barrier for a 
period that allows sufficient time for the implementation of offsite emergency procedures following the 
onset of core damage. Containment shall also prevent uncontrolled releases of radioactivity after this 
period. 
Particular attention shall be placed on the prevention of potential containment bypass in severe 
accidents. 
The design authority shall establish initial severe accident management guidelines, taking into account 
the plant design features, including requirements for multiple units at a site, and the understanding of 
accident progression and associated phenomena. 
Consideration shall be given to the prevention of recriticality following severe accidents. 
Guidance 
“Severe accidents” refer to accidents that involve significant fuel degradation, either in-core or in-fuel 
storage. 
Detailed analysis should be performed and documented to identify and characterize accidents that can 
lead to significant fuel damage or offsite releases of radioactive material (severe accidents). In addition, 
evaluations should be carried out on the capability of complementary design features to cope with 
May 2023 
REGDOC-2.5.2, Design of Reactor Facilities, Version 2.1 
38 
 
DECs. The challenges to the plant presented by such events, and the extent to which the design may be 
reasonably expected to mitigate their consequences, should be considered in establishing the initial 
severe accident management guidelines, which will facilitate meeting the expectations of REGDOC-
2.3.2, Accident Management [3]. 
Containment leakage in a severe accident should remain below the design leakage rate limit (as defined 
in section 6.6.4) for sufficient time to allow implementation of emergency measures. Beyond this time, 
containment leakage that would lead to exceeding the small and large release safety goals should be 
precluded. This may be achieved by provision of adequate filtered containment venting along with 
other features. 
The design should include the analysis performed for severe accident progression and consequence 
evaluation including assessments on topical issues, as applicable, such as: 
• 
corium stratification 
• 
thermal-chemical interaction between corium, steel components and vessel 
• 
heat transfer from corium to vessel or end-shield 
• 
hydrogen burn 
• 
steam explosion due to molten fuel-coolant interaction 
• 
corium-concrete interaction 
The results of the severe accident analysis should be taken into account when developing initial severe 
accident management guidelines and for emergency preparedness. 
Redundant connection points for water and electrical power that may be needed to support severe 
accident management actions should use standard connections and be readily accessible. These 
connection points should also be physically separated, to minimize risks from common-cause events. 
The design should facilitate the use of equipment and supplies from onsite and offsite locations, such as 
fuel supply, batteries, onsite and offsite temporary pumps, generators and battery chargers.

5.4 
Postulated initiating events 
The design for the reactor facility shall apply a systematic approach to identifying a comprehensive set 
of postulated initiating events, such that all foreseeable events with the potential for serious 
consequences or with a significant frequency of occurrence are anticipated and considered. 
Postulated initiating events can lead to AOOs, DBAs or BDBAs, and include credible failures or 
malfunctions of SSCs, as well as operator errors, common-cause internal hazards, and external hazards. 
For a site with multiple units, the design shall take due account of the potential for specific hazards 
simultaneously impacting several units on the site. 
Guidance 
The postulated initiating events (PIEs) are identified using engineering judgment and deterministic and 
probabilistic assessment. A justification of the extent of usage of deterministic safety analyses and 
May 2023 
REGDOC-2.5.2, Design of Reactor Facilities, Version 2.1 
39 
 
probabilistic safety analyses should be provided, in order to show that all foreseeable events have been 
considered. 
Sufficient information should be provided regarding the methods used to identify PIEs, their scope and 
classification. In cases where the identification methods have made use of analytical tools (e.g., master 
logic diagrams, hazard and operability analysis, failure modes and effect analysis), detailed information 
is expected. 
A systematic approach to event classification should consider all internal and external events, all 
normal operating configurations, various plant and site conditions, and failure in other plant systems 
(e.g., storage for irradiated fuel and tanks for radioactive substances). 
The design should take into account failure of equipment that is not part of the reactor facility, if the 
failure has a significant impact on nuclear safety. 
REGDOC-2.4.1, Deterministic Safety Analysis [20], and REGDOC-2.4.2, Probabilistic Safety 
Assessments [1], provide the requirements and guidance for establishing the scope of PIEs, and for 
classifying the PIEs in accordance with their anticipated frequencies and other factors, as appropriate. 
For further information on the safety analysis for the identified PIEs, refer to section 7.0 of this 
document.

5.4.1 
Internal hazards 
SSCs important to safety shall be designed and located in a manner that minimizes the probability and 
effects of hazards (e.g., fires and explosions) caused by external or internal events. 
The plant design shall take into account the potential for internal hazards, such as flooding, missile 
generation, pipe whip, jet impact, fire, smoke, and combustion by-products, or release of fluid from 
failed systems or from other installations on the site. Appropriate preventive and mitigation measures 
shall be provided to ensure that nuclear safety is not compromised. 
Internal events that the plant is designed to withstand shall be identified, and AOOs, DBAs and DECs 
shall be determined from these events. 
The possible interaction of external and internal events shall be considered, such as external events that 
may initiate internal fires or floods, or that may lead to the generation of missiles. 
Guidance 
The design should take into account specific loads and environmental conditions (temperature, pressure, 
humidity, radiation) imposed on structures or components by internal hazards. 
The following potential initiators of flooding should be considered: 
• 
leaks and breaks in pressure-retaining components 
• 
flooding by water from neighbouring buildings 
May 2023 
REGDOC-2.5.2, Design of Reactor Facilities, Version 2.1 
40 
 
• 
spurious actuation of the fire-fighting system 
• 
overfilling of tanks 
• 
failures of isolating devices 
The design considers internal missiles that can be generated by failure of rotating components (such as 
turbines), or by failure of pressurized components. For those potential missiles considered to be 
credible, the following actions should be taken: 
• 
a realistic assessment is made of the postulated missile size and energy, and its potential trajectories 
• 
potentially impacted components associated with systems required to achieve and maintain a safe 
shutdown state are identified 
• 
a loss of these potentially impacted components is evaluated to determine if sufficient redundancy 
remains to achieve and maintain a safe shutdown state 
The civil design takes into account loads generated by internal hazards in the environmental loading 
category consistent with section 5.15. 
5.4.2 
External hazards 
All natural and human-induced external hazards that may be linked with significant radiological risk 
shall be identified. External hazards that the plant is designed to withstand shall be selected and 
classified as DBAs or DECs. 
Various interactions between the plant and the environment, such as population in the surrounding area, 
meteorology, hydrology, geology and seismology shall be identified during the site evaluation and 
environmental assessment processes. These interactions shall be taken into account in determining the 
design basis for the reactor facility. 
Applicable natural external hazards shall include such hazards as earthquakes, droughts, floods, high 
winds, tornadoes, tsunami, and extreme meteorological conditions. Human induced external hazards 
shall include those that are identified in the site evaluation, such as potential aircraft crashes, ship 
collisions, and terrorist activities. 
Guidance 
The design should take into account all site characteristics that may affect the safety of the plant, and 
should identify the following: 
• 
site-specific hazard evaluation for external hazards (of human or natural origin) 
• 
design assumptions or values, in terms of recurrence probability of external hazards 
• 
definition of the design basis for external hazards 
• 
collection of site reference data for the plant design (geotechnical, seismological, hydrological, 
hydrogeological and meteorological) 
• 
evaluation of the impact of the site-related issues to be considered in the application, concerning 
emergency preparedness and accident management 
• 
arrangements for the monitoring of site-related parameters throughout the life of the plant  
Natural external hazards other than earthquakes may be categorized as: 
• 
hazards that have potential to damage SSCs important to safety hazards that are evaluated and 
screened out 
May 2023 
REGDOC-2.5.2, Design of Reactor Facilities, Version 2.1 
41 
 
Natural external hazards considered in the design process should include: 
• 
earthquakes 
• 
extreme meteorological conditions of temperature, snow, freezing rain, hail, frost, subsurface 
freezing and drought 
• 
floods due to tides, tsunamis, seiches, storm surges, precipitation, waterspouts, dam forming and 
dam failures, snow melt, land slides into water bodies, channel changes and work in the channel 
• 
cyclones (e.g., hurricanes, tornadoes) and straight winds 
• 
abrasive dust and sandstorms 
• 
lightning 
• 
volcanoes (site is sufficiently remote from volcanoes) 
• 
biological phenomena 
• 
collision of floating debris (e.g., ice, logs) with accessible safety-related structures, such as water 
intakes and ultimate heat sink components 
• 
geomagnetic storm (solar flare and electromagnetic pulses) 
• 
combinations of extreme weather conditions that could reasonably be assumed to occur at the same 
time 
Natural external hazards that are evaluated and screened out may be based on the following criteria: 
• 
a phenomenon that occurs slowly or with adequate warning with respect to the time required to take 
appropriate protective action 
• 
a phenomenon that in itself has no significant impact on the operation of a reactor facility and its 
design basis 
• 
an individual phenomenon that has an extremely low probability of occurrence 
• 
the reactor facility is located sufficiently distant from or above the postulated phenomenon (e.g., 
fire, flooding) 
• 
a phenomenon that is already included or enveloped by design in another phenomenon (e.g., storm-
surge and seiche included in flooding or accidental small aircraft crash enveloped by tornado loads) 
Human induced hazards considered in the design process should include: 
• 
aircraft crashes (general aviation) 
• 
explosions (deflagrations and detonations) with or without fire, with or without secondary missiles, 
originating from offsite and onsite sources (but external to safety-related buildings), such as 
hazardous or pressurized materials in storage, transformers, pressure vessels, or high-energy 
rotating equipment 
• 
release of hazardous gases (asphyxiant, toxic) from offsite and onsite storage 
• 
release of corrosive gases and liquids from offsite and onsite storage 
• 
release of radioactive material from offsite sources 
• 
fire generated from offsite sources (mainly for its potential for generating smoke and toxic gases) 
• 
collision of ships or floating debris with accessible safety-related structures, such as water intakes 
and ultimate heat sink components 
• 
collision of vehicles at the site with SSCs 
• 
electromagnetic interference from off the site (e.g., from communication centres and portable phone 
antennas) and on the site (e.g., from the activation of high voltage electrical switchgear and from 
unshielded cables) 
• 
any combination of the above, as a result of a common initiating hazard (such as an explosion with 
fire and release of hazardous gases and smoke) 
Malevolent acts, including aircraft crashes, are considered separately in section 5.22. 
May 2023 
REGDOC-2.5.2, Design of Reactor Facilities, Version 2.1 
42 
 
For civil design, human induced hazards classified as DBAs are taken into account as loads in the 
abnormal or extreme environmental load category, consistent with section 5.15. Less frequent human 
induced hazards are considered part of DECs.

Combination of events 
Combinations of randomly occurring individual events that could credibly lead to AOOs, DBAs, or 
DECs shall be considered in the design. Such combinations shall be identified early in the design phase, 
and shall be confirmed using a systematic approach. 
Events that may result from other events, such as a flood following an earthquake, shall be considered 
to be part of the original PIE. 
Guidance 
Where the results of engineering judgment, deterministic safety assessments and probabilistic safety 
assessments indicate potential combinations of events, such combinations should be considered to be 
AOOs, DBAs or DECs, depending on their likelihood of occurrence. 
5.5 
Design rules and limits 
The design authority shall specify the engineering design rules for all SSCs. These rules shall comply 
with appropriate accepted engineering practices. 
The design shall also identify SSCs to which design limits are applicable. These design limits shall be 
specified for operational states, DBAs and DECs. 
Guidance 
Methods to ensure a robust design are applied, and proven engineering practices are adhered to in the 
design, as a way to ensure that the fundamental safety functions would be achieved in all operational 
states, DBAs and DECs. 
The engineering design rules for all SSCs should be determined based on their importance to safety, in 
accordance with the criteria in section 5.1. The design rules should include, as applicable: 
• 
identified codes and standards 
• 
conservative safety margins 
• 
reliability and availability: 
• 
material selection 
• 
single-failure criterion 
May 2023 
REGDOC-2.5.2, Design of Reactor Facilities, Version 2.1 
43 
 
• 
redundancy 
• 
separation 
• 
diversity 
• 
independence 
• 
fail-safe design 
• 
equipment qualification: 
• 
environmental qualification 
• 
seismic qualification 
• 
qualification against electromagnetic interference 
• 
operational considerations: 
• 
testability 
• 
inspectability 
• 
maintainability 
• 
aging management 
• 
management system 
The design of complementary design features should be such that they are effective for fulfilling the 
actions credited in the safety analysis, with a reasonable degree of confidence. Other SSCs that are 
credited for DECs should also meet this expectation. 
Design rules should include relevant national and international codes and standards. In cases of SSCs 
for which there are no appropriate established codes or standards, an approach derived from existing 
codes or standards for similar SSCs may be applied; in the absence of such codes and standards, the 
results of experience, tests, analysis or a combination of these may be applied, and this approach should 
be justified. 
A set of design limits consistent with the key physical parameters for each SSC important to safety for 
the reactor facility should be specified for all operational states, DBAs and DECs. The design limits 
specified are consistent with relevant national and international codes and standards. 
5.6 
Design for reliability 
All SSCs important to safety shall be designed with sufficient quality and reliability to meet the design 
limits. A reliability analysis shall be performed for each of these SSCs. 
Where possible, the design shall provide for testing to demonstrate that the reliability requirements will 
be met during operation. 
The safety systems and their support systems shall be designed to ensure that the probability of a safety 
system failure on demand from all causes is lower than 10-3. 
The reliability model for each system may use realistic failure criteria and best-estimate failure rates, 
considering the anticipated demand on the system from PIEs. 
Design for reliability shall take account of mission times for SSCs important to safety. 
The design shall take into account the availability of offsite services upon which the safety of the plant 
and protection of the public may depend, such as the electricity supply and external emergency 
response services. 
May 2023 
REGDOC-2.5.2, Design of Reactor Facilities, Version 2.1 
44 
 
Guidance 
The design for reliability is based on meeting applicable regulatory requirements and industry 
standards. The design should provide assurance that the requirements of 
REGDOC-2.6.1, Reliability Programs for Nuclear Power Plants, will be met during operation. 
Not all SSCs important to safety identified in the design phase will necessarily be included in the 
reliability program. 
The following principles are applied for SSCs important to safety: 
• 
the plant is designed, constructed, and operated in a manner that is consistent with the assumptions 
and risk importance of these SSCs 
• 
these SSCs do not degrade to an unacceptable level during plant operations 
• 
the frequency of transients posing challenges to SSCs is minimized 
• 
these SSCs function reliably when challenged 
The reliability of SSCs assumed in the design stage needs to be realistic and achievable. 
Deterministic analysis or other methods may be used if the PSA lacks effective models or data to 
evaluate the reliability of SSCs. 
5.6.1 
Common-cause failures 
The potential for common-cause failures (CCFs) of items important to safety shall be considered in 
determining where to apply the principles of separation, diversity and independence so as to achieve the 
necessary reliability. Such failures could simultaneously affect a number of different items important to 
safety. The event or cause could be a design deficiency, a manufacturing deficiency, an operating or 
maintenance error, a natural phenomenon, a human-induced event, or an unintended cascading effect 
from any other operation or failure within the plant. 
Guidance 
Failure of a number of devices or components to perform their functions could occur as a result of a 
single specific event or cause. CCFs could also occur when multiple components of the same type fail 
at the same time. This could be caused by occurrences such as a change in ambient conditions, 
saturation of signals, repeated maintenance error or design deficiency.

5.6.2 
Separation 
The design shall provide sufficient physical separation between: 
1. redundant divisions of a safety system 
2. redundant divisions of a safety support system 
3. a safety support system and a process system 
This shall apply to equipment and to the routing of items, including: 
1. electrical cables for power and control of equipment 
2. piping for service water for the cooling of fuel and process equipment 
3. tubing and piping for compressed air or hydraulic drives for control equipment 
Where physical separation by horizontal distance alone may not be sufficient for some CCFs (such as 
flooding), vertical separation or other protection shall be provided. 
Where physical separation is not possible, safety support system equipment may share physical space. 
In such cases, the reasons for the lack of separation and justification for the space sharing arrangement 
shall be explained in the design documentation. 
Where space sharing is necessary, services for safety systems and for other process systems important 
to safety shall be arranged in a manner that incorporates the following considerations: 
1. A safety system designed to act as backup shall not be located in the same space as the primary 
safety system. 
2. If a safety system and a process system must share space, then the associated safety functions shall 
also be provided by another safety system in order to counter the possibility of failures in the 
process system. 
The design shall provide effective protection against common-cause events where sufficient physical 
separation among individual services or groups of services does not exist. The design authority shall 
assess the effectiveness of specified physical separation or protective measures against common-cause 
events. 
Guidance 
Physical separation may be achieved by barriers, distance (both horizontal and vertical) or a 
combination of the two. For example, the design may provide elevation differences of redundant 
equipment to protect against flooding. 
5.6.3 
Diversity 
Diversity shall be applied to redundant systems or components that perform the same safety function by 
incorporating different attributes into the systems or components. Such attributes shall include different 
principles of operation, different physical variables, different conditions of operation, or production by 
different manufacturers. 
It is important that any diversity used achieves the desired increase in reliability. For example, to reduce 
the potential for a CCF, the application of diversity shall be examined for any similarity in materials, 
components, and manufacturing processes, or subtle similarities in operating principles or common 
support features. If diverse components or systems are used, there shall be a reasonable assurance that 
such additions are of overall benefit, taking into account associated disadvantages such as the extra 
May 2023 
REGDOC-2.5.2, Design of Reactor Facilities, Version 2.1 
46 
 
complication in operational, maintenance, and test procedures, or the consequent use of equipment of 
lower reliability. 
Guidance 
The design should implement adequate diversity, such as: 
• 
design diversity 
• 
equipment diversity 
• 
functional diversity 
• 
human factor engineering diversity 
The design for I&C systems should also consider: 
• 
signal diversity 
• 
software diversity 
For I&C systems important to safety, an automated diverse backup system is recommended. A manual 
diverse backup system could be used; its justification should include a human factor engineering 
analysis. 
The following diversity strategies should be considered: 
• 
different technologies 
• 
different approaches within the same technology 
• 
different architectures within the same technology 
A diversity and defence in depth analysis should be conducted to assess design vulnerabilities to CCF. 
If the defence in depth analysis reveals that certain safety functions could be affected by CCF, the 
design should provide for a diverse backup system to perform the safety functions affected by the CCF. 
5.6.4 
Independence 
Interference between safety systems or between redundant elements of a safety system shall be 
prevented by means such as electrical isolation, functional independence, and independence of 
information (e.g., data transfer), as appropriate. 
Guidance 
Means for providing independence include physical separation, functional independence and 
independence from the effects of data communication errors. Generally, a combination of these 
methods should be applied to achieve an acceptable level of independence. 
Functional independence (such as electrical isolation) should be used to reduce the likelihood of 
adverse interaction between equipment and components of redundant or connected systems resulting 
from normal operation or failure of any component in the systems. 
SSCs important to safety should be independent of the effects of an event to which they are required to 
respond. For example, an event should not cause the failure or loss of a safety system or safety function 
that is necessary to mitigate the consequences of that event. 
May 2023 
REGDOC-2.5.2, Design of Reactor Facilities, Version 2.1 
47 
 
Redundant portions of a safety group should be independent from each other to ensure that the safety 
group can perform its safety function during (and following) any event that requires that function. 
The functional failure of the support features of a safety system should not compromise the 
independence between redundant portions of a safety system, or between a safety system and a system 
of lower safety classification. 
The potential for harmful interactions between SSCs important to safety that might be required to 
operate simultaneously should be evaluated, and the effects of any harmful interactions should be 
prevented. 
In the analysis of the potential for harmful interactions of SSCs important to safety, due account should 
be taken of physical interconnections, and of the possible effects of 1 system’s operation, maloperation 
or malfunction on the local environmental conditions for other essential systems. This would ensure 
that changes in environmental conditions do not affect the reliability of systems or components while 
functioning as intended. 
5.6.5 
Single-failure criterion 
All safety groups shall function in the presence of a single failure. The single-failure criterion (SFC) 
requires that each safety group can perform all safety functions required for a PIE in the presence of any 
single component failure, as well as: 
1. all failures caused by that single failure 
2. all identifiable but non-detectable failures, including those in the non-tested components 
3. all failures and spurious system actions that cause (or are caused by) the PIE 
Each safety group shall be able to perform the required safety functions under the worst permissible 
systems configuration, taking into account such considerations as maintenance, testing, inspection and 
repair, and equipment outage. 
Analysis of all possible single failures, and all associated consequential failures, shall be conducted for 
each component of each safety group until all safety groups have been considered. 
Unintended actions and failure of passive components shall be considered as 2 of the modes of failure 
of a safety group. 
The single failure shall be assumed to occur prior to the PIE, or at any time during the mission time for 
which the safety group is required to function following the PIE. Passive components may be exempt 
from this requirement. 
Exceptions to the SFC shall be infrequent, and clearly justified. 
Exemptions for passive components may be applied only to those components that are designed and 
manufactured to high standards of quality, that are adequately inspected and maintained in service, and 
that remain unaffected by the PIE. Design documentation shall include justification of such exemptions, 
by analysis, testing or a combination of analysis and testing. The justification shall take loads and 
environmental conditions into account, as well as the total period of time after the PIE for which the 
functioning of the component is necessary. 
Check valves shall be considered to be active components if they must change state following a PIE. 
May 2023 
REGDOC-2.5.2, Design of Reactor Facilities, Version 2.1 
48 
 
Guidance 
The application of the SFC in design should follow a systematic approach applied to all safety groups. 
The approach should be adequately verified, such as by using failure modes and effects analysis. The 
SSCs inside the safety group should include both the primary SSCs and the supporting SSCs. 
The detectability of failures is implicit in the application of the SFC. Detectability is a function of the 
system design and the specified tests. A failure that cannot be detected through periodic testing, or 
revealed by alarm or anomalous indication, is non-detectable. An objective in a single-failure analysis is 
to identify non-detectable failures. To deal with identifiable but non-detectable failures, the following 
actions should be considered: 
• 
preferred action: the system or the test scheme should be redesigned to make the failure detectable 
• 
alternative action: when analyzing the effect of each single failure, all identified non-detectable 
failures should be assumed to have occurred. Therefore, the design should take appropriate 
measures to address these non-detectable failures, such as adequate redundancy and diversity 
Justification in support of an exception to the SFC should consider the consequences of failure, 
practicality of alternatives, added complexity and operational considerations. The integrated effect of all 
exceptions should not significantly degrade safety; in particular, defence in depth should be preserved. 
For passive components that are exempt from the SFC, the following should be considered in order to 
demonstrate a high degree of performance assurance: 
• 
adequate testing during the manufacturing stage 
• 
sample testing from those components received from the manufacturer 
• 
adequate testing during construction and commissioning stages 
• 
necessary testing to verify their reliability after the components have been removed from service 
during the operation stage 
Any consideration for an exception to the SFC during testing and maintenance should fall into 1 of the 
following permissible categories: 
• 
the safety function is provided by 2 redundant, independent systems (e.g., 2 redundant, fully 
effective, independent cooling means) 
• 
the expected duration of testing and maintenance is shorter than the time available before the 
function is required following an initiating event (e.g., spent fuel storage pool cooling) 
• 
the loss of safety function is partial and unlikely to lead to significant increase in risk even in the 
event of failure (e.g., small area containment isolation) 
• 
the loss of system redundancy has minor safety significance (e.g., control room air filtering) 
• 
the loss of system redundancy may slightly increase PIE frequency, but does not impact accident 
progression (e.g., leak detection) 
A request for an exception during testing and maintenance should also be supported by a satisfactory 
reliability argument covering the allowable outage time. 
The OLCs should clearly state the allowable testing and maintenance time, along with any additional 
operational restrictions, such as suspension of additional testing or maintenance on a backup system for 
the duration of the exception.

5.6.6 
Fail-safe design 
The concept of fail-safe design shall be incorporated, as appropriate, into the design of systems and 
components important to safety. To the greatest extent practicable, the application of this principle shall 
enable plant systems to pass into a safe state if a system or component fails, with no necessity for any 
action. 
Guidance 
Knowing the failure modes of SSCs is important in applying the fail-safe concept to SSCs important to 
safety. An analysis, such as a failure modes and effects analysis, should be performed to identify the 
potential failure modes of SSCs important to safety. 
Failures of SSCs important to safety should be detectable by periodic testing, or revealed by alarms or 
another reliable indication. 
5.6.7 
Allowance for equipment outages 
The design shall include provisions for adequate redundancy, reliability, and effectiveness, to allow for 
online maintenance and online testing of systems important to safety, except where these activities are 
not possible due to access control restrictions. 
The design shall take into account the time allowed for each equipment outage and the respective 
response actions. 
Guidance 
If the design does not allow online maintenance or online testing for certain equipment, the design 
should adequately demonstrate that the equipment can maintain its reliability target between outages. 
The time allowed for each equipment outage and the respective response actions should be specified in 
the OLCs. 
5.6.8 
Shared systems 
In cases where a system performs both process functions and safety functions, the following design 
requirements shall apply: 
1. the process and safety functions are not required or credited at the same time 
2. if the process function is operating, and a PIE in that system is postulated, it can be shown that all 
essential safety functions of the system that are required to mitigate the PIE are unaffected 
3. the system is designed to the standards of the function of higher importance with respect to safety 
4. if the process function is used intermittently, then the availability of the safety function after each 
use, and its continued ability to meet requirements, can be demonstrated by testing 
5. the requirements for instrumentation sharing are met 
May 2023 
REGDOC-2.5.2, Design of Reactor Facilities, Version 2.1 
50 
 
5.6.9 
Shared instrumentation for safety systems 
Instrumentation shall not typically be shared between safety systems. 
Where justified, there may be sharing between a safety system and a non-safety system (such as a 
process or control system). 
The reliability and effectiveness of a safety system shall not be impaired by normal operation, by partial 
or complete failure in other systems, or by any cross-link generated by the proposed sharing. 
The design shall include provisions to ensure that the sharing of instruments does not result in an 
increased frequency in demand on the safety system during operation. 
If the design includes sharing of instrumentation between a safety system and a non-safety system, then 
the following requirements shall apply: 
1. sharing shall be limited to the sensing devices and their pre-amplifiers or amplifiers as needed to get 
the signal to the point of processing 
2. the signal from each shared sensing device shall be electrically isolated so that a failure of a non-
safety system cannot be propagated to a safety system 
3. an isolation device shall always be associated with the safety system and shall be classified and 
qualified accordingly 
5.6.10 Sharing of SSCs between reactors 
SSCs important to safety shall typically not be shared between 2 or more reactors. 
In exceptional cases when SSCs are shared between 2 or more reactors, such sharing shall exclude 
safety systems and turbine generator buildings that contain high-pressure steam and feedwater systems, 
unless this contributes to enhanced safety. 
If sharing of SSCs between reactors is arranged, then the following requirements shall apply: 
1. safety requirements shall be met for all reactors during operational states, DBAs and DECs 
2. in the event of an accident involving 1 of the reactors, orderly shutdown, cool down, and removal of 
residual heat shall be achievable for the other reactor(s) 
When a reactor facility is under construction adjacent to an operating plant, and the sharing of SSCs 
between reactors has been justified, the availability of the SSCs and their capacity to meet all safety 
requirements for the operating units shall be assessed during the construction phase. 
5.7 
Pressure-retaining structures, systems and components 
All pressure-retaining SSCs shall be protected against overpressure conditions, and shall be classified, 
designed, fabricated, erected, inspected, and tested in accordance with established standards. For DECs, 
relief capacity shall be sufficient to provide reasonable confidence that pressure boundaries credited in 
severe accident management will not fail. 
All pressure-retaining SSCs of the reactor coolant system and auxiliaries shall be designed with an 
appropriate safety margin to ensure that the pressure boundary will not be breached, and that fuel 
design limits will not be exceeded in operational states, or DBA conditions. 
May 2023 
REGDOC-2.5.2, Design of Reactor Facilities, Version 2.1 
51 
 
The design shall minimize the likelihood of flaws in pressure boundaries. This shall include timely 
detection of flaws in pressure boundaries important to safety. 
Unless otherwise justified, all pressure boundary SSCs shall be designed to withstand static and 
dynamic loads anticipated in operational states, and DBAs. 
SSC design shall include protection against postulated pipe ruptures, unless otherwise justified. 
The operation of pressure relief devices shall not lead to significant radioactive releases from the plant. 
Where 2 fluid systems operating at different pressures are interconnected, failure of the interconnection 
shall be considered. Both systems shall either be designed to withstand the higher pressure, or provision 
shall be made so that the design pressure of the system operating at the lower pressure will not be 
exceeded. 
Adequate isolation shall be provided at the interfaces between the reactor coolant system and 
connecting systems operating at lower pressures, in order to prevent the overpressure of such systems 
and possible loss-of-coolant accidents. Consideration shall be given to the characteristics and 
importance of the isolation and its reliability targets. Isolation devices shall either be closed or close 
automatically on demand. The response time and speed of closure shall be in accordance with the 
acceptance criteria defined for postulated initiating events. 
All pressure boundary piping and vessels shall be separated from electrical and control systems to the 
greatest extent practicable. 
Pressure-retaining components whose failure will affect nuclear safety shall be designed to permit 
inspection of their pressure boundaries throughout the design life. If full inspection is not achievable, 
then it shall be augmented by indirect methods such as a program of surveillance of reference 
components. Leak detection is an acceptable method when the SSC is leak-before-break qualified. 
Guidance 
For the design of pressure-retaining systems and components, the design authority should ensure that 
the selection of codes and standards is commensurate with the safety class and is adequate to provide 
confidence that plant failures are minimized. This is achieved by using industry standards – such as 
CSA N285, General requirements for pressure-retaining systems and components in CANDU nuclear 
power plants [33], and ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code – to meet the requirements of different 
classes of pressure-retaining systems, components, piping and their supports [34]. Alternative codes and 
standards may be used if this would result in an equivalent or superior level of safety; justifications 
should be provided in such cases. 
The design should make provisions to limit stresses and deformation of SSCs important to safety during 
and after PIEs. The list of PIEs should be comprehensive, and the loads generated by them should be 
included in the design analysis. The loads generated by these PIEs should be included in the stress 
analyses required by the design. 
REGDOC-2.5.2 requires the design to minimize the likelihood of flaws in pressure boundaries. For 
example, the reactor coolant pressure boundary should be designed with sufficient margin to ensure 
that, under all operating configurations, the material selected will behave in a non-brittle manner and 
minimize the probability of rapidly propagating fractures. 
The pressure boundary components in a reactor facility almost invariably contain process fluids at very 
high temperature and pressure. The design should take into account the location of high-energy lines in 
May 2023 
REGDOC-2.5.2, Design of Reactor Facilities, Version 2.1 
52 
 
relation to SSCs important to safety, in order to limit or reduce pipe whip concerns. This includes 
consideration, where applicable, of items such as: 
• 
components in the means of shutdown 
• 
main coolant pumps 
• 
headers 
• 
emergency core cooling system components 
• 
steam generators 
• 
steam lines 
• 
turbine 
Leak-before-break 
A qualified leak-before-break (LBB) system design will permit the design authority to optimize 
protective hardware – such as pipe whip restraints and jet impingement barriers – and to redesign pipe-
connected components, their supports and their internals. 
A qualified LBB methodology should include the following: 
• 
LBB should be applied only to high-energy, ASME Code Class 1 or 2 piping or the equivalent. 
Applications to other high-energy piping may be performed based on an evaluation of the proposed 
design and in-service inspection requirements. 
• 
No uncontrolled active degradation mechanism should exist in the piping system to be qualified for 
LBB. 
• 
An evaluation of phenomena such as water hammer, creep damage, flow accelerated corrosion and 
fatigue should be performed to cover the entire life of the high-energy piping systems. To 
demonstrate that water hammer is not a significant contributor to pipe rupture, reliance on historical 
frequencies of water hammer events in specific piping systems coupled with reviews of operating 
procedures and conditions may be used for this evaluation. 
• 
Leak detection methods for the reactor coolant should ensure that adequate detection margins exist 
for the postulated through-wall flaw used in the deterministic fracture mechanics evaluation. The 
margins should cover uncertainties in the determination of leakage from a piping system. 
• 
Stress analyses of the piping that is considered for LBB should be in accordance with the 
requirements of section III of the ASME code or equivalent. 
• 
The LBB evaluation should use design basis loads and, after construction, be updated to use the as-
built piping configuration, as opposed to the design configuration. 
• 
The methodology should take account of potential for degradation by erosion, corrosion, and 
erosion-cavitation due to unfavourable flow conditions and water chemistry. 
• 
The methodology should take account of material susceptibility to corrosion, the potential for high 
residual stresses, and environmental conditions that could lead to degradation by stress corrosion 
cracking. 
In addition, leak detection methods for the reactor coolant should be examined to ensure that adequate 
detection margins exist for the postulated through-wall flaw used in the deterministic fracture 
mechanics evaluation. 
Finite element methods 
The design authority customarily uses finite element methods to show that all of the pressure boundary 
components (both vessels and piping) meet the structural integrity requirements imposed by applicable 
May 2023 
REGDOC-2.5.2, Design of Reactor Facilities, Version 2.1 
53 
 
design codes and standards. When finite element methods are used for design analyses covering all 
ASME (or equivalent) class components, the design authority should ensure that: 
• 
finite element modelling and analysis assumptions are checked to make sure they are justified and 
conservative 
• 
finite element mesh is properly refined to account for geometric structural discontinuities with 
proper element shapes and aspect ratios 
• 
loads and boundary conditions are correct and properly applied in the finite element models 
• 
load combinations and scale factors applied to unit load cases conform to design or load 
specifications 
• 
linearized stress results, obtained from load combinations, are compared with ASME code (or 
equivalent) allowable limits 
5.8 
Equipment environmental qualification 
The design shall include an equipment environmental qualification (EQ) program. Development and 
implementation of this program shall ensure that the following functions can be carried out: 
1. the reactor can be safely shut down and kept in a safe shutdown state during and following AOOs 
and DBAs 
2. residual heat can be removed from the reactor after shutdown, and also during and following AOOs 
and DBAs 
3. potential for release of radioactive material from the plant can be limited, and the resulting dose to 
the public from AOOs and DBAs can be kept within the dose acceptance criteria 
4. post-accident conditions can be monitored to indicate whether the above functions are being carried 
out 
The environmental conditions to be accounted for shall include those expected during normal operation, 
and those arising from AOOs and DBAs. Operational data and applicable design assist analysis tools, 
such as the probabilistic safety assessment, shall be used to determine the envelope of environmental 
conditions. 
The equipment qualification program for SSCs important to safety shall include the consideration of 
aging effects due to service life. 
Equipment qualification shall also include consideration of any unusual environmental conditions that 
can reasonably be anticipated, and that could arise during normal operation or AOOs (such as periodic 
testing of the containment leak rate). 
Equipment and instrumentation credited to operate during DECs shall be demonstrated, with reasonable 
confidence, to be capable of performing their intended safety function(s) under the expected 
environmental conditions. A justifiable extrapolation of equipment and instrumentation behaviour may 
be used to provide assurance of operability, and is typically based on design specifications, 
environmental qualification testing, or other considerations. 
Guidance 
The designer should provide detailed processes and specifications for an equipment EQ program, for 
qualifying safety-related equipment associated with systems that are essential to perform the credited 
safety functions. The EQ program should address qualification criteria and methods used, and all 
anticipated environmental conditions upon which the qualification of the equipment (mechanical, 
electrical, I&C and certain post accident monitoring) is based. 
May 2023 
REGDOC-2.5.2, Design of Reactor Facilities, Version 2.1 
54 
 
The designer should identify the EQ-related standards and codes (e.g., CSA, IEEE and ASME). The 
latest editions of the applicable standards for use in the equipment qualification are preferred; any 
deviations should be justified. 
At a minimum, the basic EQ program elements should be provided as described below. 
Identification of equipment requiring harsh environmental qualification 
The design should identify: 
• 
systems and equipment required to perform safety functions in a harsh environment, including their 
safety functions and applicable DBAs 
• 
non-safety-related equipment whose failure due to a harsh post-accident environment could prevent 
safety-related equipment from accomplishing its safety function 
• 
accident monitoring equipment 
Identification of equipment service conditions 
Service conditions should be identified to determine required qualification methods as they apply to 
various types of qualification (e.g., harsh environments, mild environments, radiation-only harsh 
environments). 
The design should provide for: 
• 
a distinction between mild and harsh environments (e.g., specific criteria to define plant 
environments as either mild or harsh) 
• 
a list of bounding harsh DBAs for qualification of equipment 
• 
the environmental conditions (e.g., temperature, pressure, radiation, humidity, steam, chemicals, 
submergence) for each applicable DBA to which equipment is exposed in various plant locations 
• 
temperature, pressure and radiation profiles for harsh environment qualification 
• 
typical equipment mission time during DBAs 
• 
mild environmental conditions (e.g., temperature, pressure, humidity, radiation) for operational 
states, including the assumed duration of the AOOs to which equipment is exposed in various plant 
locations 
Qualification methods 
The design should describe methods used to demonstrate the performance of safety-related equipment 
when subjected to a range of environmental conditions during operational states or DBAs. The methods 
should determine whether equipment should be qualified for mild or harsh environments. 
For harsh environment qualification, the design should include the following: 
• 
For equipment and components located in a DBA harsh environment, type tests are the preferred 
method of qualification (particularly for electrical equipment); where type tests are not feasible, 
justification by analysis or operating experience (or a combination of both) may be used. 
• 
Equipment should be reviewed in terms of design, function, materials and environment, to identify 
significant aging mechanisms caused by operational and environmental conditions occurring during 
normal operation. Where a significant aging mechanism is identified, that aging should be taken 
into account in the equipment qualification. 
May 2023 
REGDOC-2.5.2, Design of Reactor Facilities, Version 2.1 
55 
 
• 
The qualification should systematically address the sequence of age conditioning, including 
sequential, simultaneous, synergistic effects, and the method for accelerating radiation degradation 
effects. 
• 
Appropriate margins, as given in EQ-related standards, should be applied to the specified 
environmental conditions. 
• 
For certain equipment (e.g., digital I&C equipment, and new advanced analog electronics), 
additional environmental conditions – such as electromagnetic interference, radio frequency 
interference, and power surges – should be addressed. 
For mild environment qualification, equipment may be considered qualified, provided that: 
• 
the environmental conditions are set out in a design specification 
• 
the manufacturer provides certification that the equipment meets the specification 
Equipment and instrumentation credited under design extension conditions 
A demonstration of equipment and instrumentation operability should include the following: 
• 
the accident timeframes for each function 
• 
the equipment type and location used to perform necessary functions in each timeframe 
• 
the functions credited in the accident timeframes that need to be performed to achieve a safe 
shutdown state for DECs 
• 
the postulated harsh environment of DECs within each timeframe 
• 
a reasonable assurance that the equipment will survive to perform its function in the accident 
timeframes, in the DEC environment 
Protective barriers 
The design should address protective barriers, if applicable. When protective barriers are designed to 
isolate equipment from possible harsh environmental conditions, the barriers themselves should be 
addressed in a qualification program. Examples of protective barriers include: 
• 
steam-protected rooms and enclosures 
• 
steam doors 
• 
water-protected rooms (for flooding)

5.9 
Instrumentation and control 
5.9.1 
General 
The design shall include provision of instrumentation to monitor plant variables and systems over the 
respective ranges for operational states, DBAs and DECs, in order to ensure that adequate information 
can be obtained on plant status. 
This shall include instrumentation for measuring variables that can affect the fission process, the 
integrity of the reactor core, the reactor cooling systems, and containment, as well as instrumentation 
for obtaining any plant information that is necessary for its reliable and safe operation. 
The design shall be such that the safety systems and any necessary support systems can be reliably and 
independently operated, either automatically or manually, when necessary. 
The design shall include provision for testing, including self-checking capabilities. 
The design shall provide for periodic testing of the entire channel of instrumentation logic, from sensing 
device to actuating device. 
The design shall facilitate maintenance, detection and diagnosis of failure, safe repair or replacement, 
and recalibration. 
The design shall also include the capability to trend and automatically record measurement of any 
derived variables that are important to safety. 
Instrumentation shall be adequate for measuring plant parameters for emergency response purposes. 
The design shall include reliable controls to maintain plant variables within specified operational 
ranges. 
The safety systems shall be designed so that, once initiated automatically or manually, the intended 
sequence of protective actions shall continue until completion. 
The design shall minimize the likelihood of operator action defeating the effectiveness of safety and 
control systems in normal operation and AOOs, without negating correct operator actions following a 
DBA. 
System control interlocks shall be designed to minimize the likelihood of inadvertent manual or 
automatic override, and to provide for situations when it is necessary to override interlocks to use 
equipment in a non-standard way. 
Various safety actions shall be automated so that operator action is not necessary within a justified 
period of time from the onset of AOOs or DBAs. In addition, appropriate information shall be available 
to the operator to confirm the safety action. 
Guidance 
Particular attention should be paid to the provision of start-up instrumentation for measuring variables 
that can affect the fission process, the integrity of the reactor core, the reactor cooling systems and 
May 2023 
REGDOC-2.5.2, Design of Reactor Facilities, Version 2.1 
57 
 
containment, as well as instrumentation for obtaining any plant information that is necessary for reliable 
and safe operation. 
The monitoring should not be limited to process variables of safety and safety-related systems. It should 
include the monitoring of radiation, hydrogen, seismic, vibration, and, as applicable, loose parts and 
fatigue. 
The measurements should include continuous and discrete plant variables. Detection and testing should 
also consider failure, degradation, unsafe conditions, and deviation from specified limits, operator 
errors, and self-diagnosis. Correction of invalid, inauthentic and corrupted functions or data should be 
applied to maintain the reliability of systems. 
Once safety systems are initiated, the reset of safety system functions should require separate operator 
actions for each system-level function. Deliberate operator action should be required to return the safety 
systems to normal. However, this should not prevent the use of essential equipment protective devices 
(such as protection for electrical or mechanical components) or the provision for deliberate operator 
interventions (such as trip and isolation of the switchgear). Seal-in of safety system actuation is 
generally required at system or subsystem level, but not required at individual channel level. 
The design should provide for the capability to record, store and display historical information, if such 
displays will help plant staff to identify patterns and trends, understand the past or current state of the 
system, perform post-accident analysis, or predict future progressions. 
The design should take into account redundancy, independence, common-cause failure, interaction with 
other systems, and signal validation, so as to meet the reliability target. 
When a safety system has been taken out of service for testing or maintenance, clear indication should 
be provided for the duration of testing or maintenance activities. For any safety systems being 
bypassed, the bypassed condition should also be clearly annunciated. 
If the use of a system for testing or maintenance can impair an I&C function, the interfaces should be 
subject to hardware interlocking in order to ensure that interaction with the test or maintenance system 
is impossible without deliberate manual intervention. 
Testing provisions that are permanently connected to safety systems should be part of the safety 
systems, and should be the same class as the safety systems unless reliable buffering is in place or 
system performance is not negatively impacted. 
The interlock systems important to safety should either reduce the probability of occurrence for specific 
events, or maintain safety systems in an available state during an accident. The interlock systems should 
be described and justified. 
Means should be provided to automatically initiate and control all safety actions, except those for which 
manual action alone has been justified. Examples of situations in which manual action alone might be 
justified include: 
• 
initiation of safety tasks after completion of automatic sequences 
• 
initiation of safety actions that are not required until a considerable time after the PIE 
• 
control actions to bring the plant to a safe state in the long term after an accident 
The value of each input parameter used in safety system functions, the status of each trip and actuation 
function in each division, and the status of each system initiation should be available to plant operators.

5.9.2 
Use of computer-based systems or equipment 
Appropriate standards and practices for the development and testing of computer hardware and 
software shall be established and implemented throughout the lifetime of the system or equipment, and 
in particular, throughout the software development cycle. 
A top-down software development process shall be used to facilitate verification and validation 
activities. This approach shall include verification at each step of the development process to 
demonstrate that the respective product is correct, and validation to demonstrate that the resulting 
computer-based system or equipment meets its functional and performance requirements. 
If pre-developed software is used in systems or equipment important to safety, then the software (and 
any subsequent release of the software) shall be developed, inspected, and tested in accordance with 
standards of a category commensurate with the safety function provided by the given system or 
equipment. 
The software development process, including control, testing, and commissioning of design changes, as 
well as the results of independent assessment of that process, shall be reviewable and systematically 
documented in the design documentation. 
Where a function important to safety is computer-based, the following requirements shall apply: 
1. Functions not essential to safety are separate from and shown not to impact the safety function. 
2. The safety function is normally executed in processors separate from software that implements 
other functions, such as control, monitoring, and display. 
3. The requirements associated with diversity apply to computer-based systems that perform similar 
safety functions – the choice of diversity type shall be justified. 
May 2023 
REGDOC-2.5.2, Design of Reactor Facilities, Version 2.1 
59 
 
4. The design incorporates fail-safe and fault tolerance features, and the additional complexity ensuing 
from these features results in an overall gain in safety. 
Guidance 
The standards and practices used for computer-based systems or equipment are identified prior to the 
design. The I&C development lifecycle, which implements the identified requirements, should be 
coordinated with the human factors engineering lifecycle and the cyber security lifecycle, since they 
have a strong influence on I&C development. 
The I&C development lifecycle includes verification and validation activities. These activities should 
be identified and use appropriate engineering approaches; e.g., a top-down or bottom-up approach. The 
relationship between design, verification and validation should be indicated, and the outcome of 
verification and validation activities should be documented. 
The pre-developed software should have the same level of qualification as software that is written 
specifically for the application. The qualification of software should be verified through the national or 
international standards relevant to the qualification activities of pre-developed software. 
When the pre-developed software was not developed to equivalent standards, it may be used to 
implement IEC 61226 category B and C functions. However, a qualification plan and qualification 
report should be prepared to demonstrate that this software is fit for its intended purpose and meets the 
requirements in IEC 62138. 
The software development process should include consideration of consistency, modularity, 
structuredness, traceability, understandability and verifiability: 
• 
consistency applies to uniform notations, terminology, comments, symbology, and implementation 
techniques 
• 
modularity ensures that any change to 1 component has minimal impact on the others 
• 
structuredness means that the design should proceed in an orderly and systematic manner (e.g., top-
down design) and have minimized coupling between modules and subsystems 
• 
traceability provides a thread to antecedent and subsequent documents, and refers to the ability to 
trace the design decision history and reasons for changes 
• 
understandability means that the development processes and outputs should be clear to a third party 
• 
verifiability refers to the extent to which the development processes and outputs have been created 
to facilitate verification using both static methods and testing 
The complete software development documentation should provide all information throughout the 
software development lifecycle.

Accident monitoring instrumentation 
Instrumentation and recording equipment shall be such that essential information is available to support 
plant procedures during and following DBAs and DECs by: 
1. indicating plant status 
2. identifying the locations of radioactive material 
3. supporting estimation of quantities of radioactive material 
4. recording vital plant parameters 
5. facilitating decisions in accident management 
Guidance 
Instrumentation is provided to ensure that essential information is available for assessing plant 
conditions, monitoring safety system performance, making decisions related to plant responses to 
abnormal events, and predicting radioactive material releases. Instrumentation is also provided for 
recording vital plant parameters and variables, such as: 
• 
temperature at various locations 
• 
pressure of containment, and primary coolant system 
• 
level of radioactivity at various locations 
• 
reactor vessel water level for a light water reactor (LWR), or heat transport system 
water level and 
moderator level for a CANDU reactor 
• 
containment water level 
• 
hydrogen concentration 
The design should provide the design basis, design criteria, and display criteria for the accident 
monitoring parameters. 
Accident monitoring instrumentation should meet performance criteria, such as measurement range, 
accuracy, response time, operating time and reliability target. Appropriate design analysis should be 
performed to confirm that the performance criteria have been met. 
Accident monitoring instrumentation meets the single-failure criterion (section 5.6.5). The design 
should ensure that there are no common causes that can lead to the failure of instrumentation providing 
redundant measurements. 
To the extent practicable, the same variables and displays should be used for both normal operation and 
accident monitoring. 
The design should: 
• 
incorporate testing capability to verify operability requirements on a periodic basis 
• 
facilitate maintenance, repair and calibration 
• 
permit administrative access control for instrument channel calibration and testing 
Accident monitoring instrumentation is demonstrated to be qualified to perform its required functions 
for the length of time when its function is required under DBAs and DECs.

Safety support system 
The safety support systems shall ensure that the fundamental safety functions are available in 
operational states, DBAs and DECs. Safety support systems provide services such as electrical power, 
compressed air, water, and air conditioning and ventilation to systems important to safety. 
Where normal services are provided from external sources, backup safety support systems shall also be 
available onsite. 
The design shall incorporate emergency safety support systems to cope with the possibility of loss of 
normal service and, where applicable, concurrent loss of backup systems. 
The systems that provide normal services, backup services and emergency services shall have: 
1. sufficient capacity to meet the load requirements of the systems that perform the fundamental safety 
functions 
2. availability and reliability commensurate with the systems to which they supply the service 
The emergency support systems shall: 
1. be independent of normal and backup systems 
2. support continuity of the fundamental safety functions until long-term (normal or backup) service is 
re-established: 
a. without the need for operator action to connect temporary onsite services for at least 8 hours 
b. without the need for offsite services and support for at least 72 hours 
3. have a capacity margin that allows for future increases in demand 
4. be testable under design load conditions, where practicable 
Guidance 
The design basis for any compressed air system that serves an item important to safety at the reactor 
facility should specify the quality, flow rate and cleanness of the air to be provided. 
Systems for air conditioning, air heating, air cooling and ventilation should be provided (as appropriate) 
in auxiliary rooms or other areas at the nuclear power plant, so as to maintain the required 
environmental conditions for systems and components important to safety, in all plant states. 
Pre-installed equipment can be credited for accident mitigation after 30 minutes where only control 
room actions are needed or after 1 hour if field actions are needed. These actions should be limited to 
May 2023 
REGDOC-2.5.2, Design of Reactor Facilities, Version 2.1 
62 
 
operating valves, starting pumps, etc. Guidance is provided in section 6.10.5 for justification of such 
actions. 
If equipment is not pre-installed, but is stored onsite, it can normally be credited after 8 hours. 
However, this should be justified based on an assessment of the actions required and the availability of 
procedures and training to support those actions. It is possible that longer times may be necessary for 
complex actions. Equipment or supplies stored offsite or support staff from offsite should not normally 
be credited for 72 hours. Again, the value used should be justified and may be longer. 
Guidance on redundant connection points for temporary services is described in section 5.3.5. 
5.11 
Guaranteed shutdown state 
The design authority shall define the guaranteed shutdown state (GSS) that will support safe 
maintenance activities of the reactor facility. 
The design shall provide 2 independent means of preventing recriticality from any pathway or 
mechanism when the reactor is in the GSS. 
The shutdown margin for GSS shall be such that the core will remain subcritical for any credible 
changes in the core configuration and reactivity addition. Where possible, this shall be achieved without 
operator intervention. 
Guidance 
A GSS refers to a reactor remaining in a stable, sub-critical state, independent of any perturbation in 
reactivity produced by any change in core configuration, core properties, or process system failure. 
The design should describe the GSSs that are expected to be used over the life of the facility, including 
steps for GSS placement and removal, and functional tests to be performed. 
5.12 
Fire safety 
The design of the reactor facility, including that of external buildings and SSCs integral to plant 
operation, shall include provisions for fire safety. 
5.12.1 General 
Suitable incorporation of operational procedures, redundant SSCs, physical barriers, spatial separation, 
fire protection systems, and design for fail-safe operation shall achieve the following general objectives: 
1. prevent the initiation of fires 
2. limit the propagation and effects of fires that do occur by: 
a. quickly detecting and suppressing fires to limit damage 
b. confining the spread of fires and fire by-products that have not been extinguished 
3. prevent loss of redundancy in safety and safety support systems 
4. provide assurance of safe shutdown 
5. ensure that monitoring of safety-critical parameters remains available 
6. prevent exposure, uncontrolled release, or unacceptable dispersion of hazardous substances, nuclear 
material, or radioactive material due to fires 
7. prevent the detrimental effects of event mitigation efforts, both inside and outside of containment 
8. ensure structural sufficiency and stability in the event of fire 
May 2023 
REGDOC-2.5.2, Design of Reactor Facilities, Version 2.1 
63 
 
Buildings or structures shall be constructed using non-combustible or fire retardant and heat resistant 
material. 
Fire is considered an internal hazard. The essential safety functions shall be available during a fire. 
Fire suppression systems shall be designed and located such that rupture, or spurious or inadvertent 
operation, will not significantly impair the capability of SSCs important to safety. 
Guidance 
Effective fire protection is achieved by: 
• 
fire protection features such as programs and procedures, fire prevention, fire detection, fire 
warning, emergency communication, fire by-product management, fire suppression and fire 
containment, non-combustible construction, seismic and environmental qualification of fire 
protection equipment 
• 
the use of physical barriers to segregate redundant SSCs important to safety 
The design should address protection from fire by demonstrating that a defence in depth approach has 
been implemented. Supporting documents are expected to include a comprehensive design report, code 
compliance review, a fire hazard assessment, fire safe shutdown analysis, and a fire protection program. 
An independent third-party review of the design should be performed to assess compliance with the 
applicable fire codes and standards used for protection from fires and explosions. The review should 
provide a definitive statement that the design conforms to the identified codes and standards, meets 
good engineering practices, and achieves fire protection objectives. 
The design should comply with the requirements of the following codes and standards: 
• 
CSA Group, N293, Fire protection for nuclear power plants [58] 
• 
NRC, National Building Code of Canada [26] 
• 
NRC, National Fire Code of Canada [59] 
Although CSA N293 is considered acceptable to provide technology-neutral design criteria, it does not 
fully address some fire safety aspects, such as: 
• 
operator-initiated manual actions 
• 
associated fire safe shutdown circuit analysis 
• 
multiple spurious operations

5.12.2 Safety to life 
The design shall provide protection to workers and the public from event sequences initiated by fire or 
explosion in accordance with established radiological, toxicological, and human factor criteria so that 
the following objectives are achieved: 
1. Persons not intimate with the initial event (including the public, occupants, and emergency 
responders) are protected from injury and loss of life. 
2. Persons intimate with the initial event have a low probability of injury or death. 
To demonstrate that the above life safety objectives have been achieved, the design shall provide: 
1. effective and reliable means of fire detection in all areas 
2. effective and reliable means of emergency notification, including the nature of the emergency and 
protective actions to be taken 
3. multiple and separate safe egress routes from any area 
4. easily accessible exits 
5. effective and reliable identification and illumination of egress routes and exits 
6. sufficient exiting capacity for the number of workers (taking into account the emergency movement 
of crowds) 
7. protection of workers from fires and fire by-products (i.e., combustion products, smoke, heat, etc.) 
during egress and in the areas of refuge 
8. protection of workers performing plant control and mitigation functions during or following a fire 
9. adequate supporting infrastructure (lighting, access, etc.) for workers to perform emergency 
response, plant control, and mitigation activities during or following a fire 
10. sufficient structural integrity and stability of buildings and structures to ensure the safety of workers 
and emergency responders during and after a fire 
11. protection of workers from the release or dispersion of hazardous substances, radioactive material, 
or nuclear material as a result of fire 
May 2023 
REGDOC-2.5.2, Design of Reactor Facilities, Version 2.1 
65 
 
Guidance 
The National Building Code of Canada (NBCC) [26] and the National Fire Code of Canada (NFCC) 
[59] are objective-based national model codes. The provisions of the NBCC and NFCC are considered 
the minimum acceptable measures for meeting the objectives of safety, health, structural protection, and 
fire protection of buildings. As such, additional fire protection measures may be required to meet the 
regulatory requirements detailed in this regulatory document. Additional fire safety provisions are 
usually assessed and documented in the code compliance and fire hazard assessment, as required by 
CSA N293, Fire protection for nuclear power plants [58]. 
5.12.3 Environmental protection and nuclear safety 
The design shall minimize the release and dispersion of hazardous substances or radioactive material to 
the environment, and shall minimize the impact of any releases or dispersions, including those resulting 
from fire. 
Guidance 
As indicated in section 5.12.2 and 5.12.3, the NBCC and the NFCC cover the minimum fire safety and 
fire protection features that must be incorporated at the time of building design and construction. 
Additional fire safety provisions are usually assessed and documented in the code compliance, fire 
hazard assessment and fire safe shutdown analysis, as required by CSA N293. 
5.13 
Seismic qualification and design 
The seismic qualification of all SSCs shall meet the requirements of Canadian national or equivalent 
standards. 
The design shall include instrumentation for monitoring seismic activity at the site for the life of the 
plant. 
5.13.1 Seismic design and classification 
The design authority shall ensure that seismically qualified SSCs important to safety are qualified to a 
design-basis earthquake (DBE), and ensure that they are categorized accordingly. This shall apply to: 
1. SSCs whose failure could directly or indirectly cause an accident leading to core damage 
2. SSCs restricting the release of radioactive material to the environment 
3. SSCs that assure the subcriticality of stored nuclear material 
4. SSCs such as radioactive waste tanks containing radioactive material that, if released, would exceed 
regulatory dose limits 
The design of these SSCs shall also meet the DBE criteria to maintain all essential attributes, such as 
pressure boundary integrity, leak-tightness, operability, and proper position in the event of a DBE. 
The design shall ensure that no substantive damage to these SSCs will be caused by the failure of any 
other SSC under DBE conditions. 
Seismic fragility levels shall be evaluated for SSCs important to safety by analysis or, where possible, 
by testing. 
A beyond-design-basis earthquake (BDBE) shall be identified that meets the requirements for 
identification of DECs as described in section 5.3.4. SSCs credited to function during and after a BDBE 
May 2023 
REGDOC-2.5.2, Design of Reactor Facilities, Version 2.1 
66 
 
shall be demonstrated to be capable of performing their intended function under the expected 
conditions. Such demonstration shall provide high confidence of low probability of failure (HCLPF) 
under BDBE conditions for these SSCs. This demonstration need not be seismic qualification by 
testing. 
Guidance 
The seismic design of a reactor facility should account for: 
• 
technical safety objectives and corresponding load categories 
• 
seismic input motion 
• 
seismic classification 
• 
structural layout criteria 
• 
seismic analysis and design of structural systems, subsystems and equipment 
• 
seismic testing and instrumentation 
Design and beyond design load categories are defined to demonstrate structural performance in 
operational states, DBAs and DECs. In addition, beyond design load categories are considered for 
structural performance in DECs. Earthquake load is not part of the normal load category corresponding 
to normal operation. Site design earthquake load, according to the CSA N289 series on seismic design 
and qualification, is defined under the severe load category corresponding to AOO [73]. A DBE is 
defined as a part of the abnormal or extreme load category corresponding to DBA. BDBE load should 
be considered under DECs. 
Seismic input motion, derived from the DBE, should be based on seismicity and geologic conditions at 
the site and expressed in such a manner that it can be applied for the qualification of SSCs. The DBE is 
defined by multiplying the mean site-specific uniform hazard spectrum with a probability of occurrence 
of 10-4/yr by a design factor, defined in the standard ASCE 43-05, Seismic Design Criteria for 
Structures, Systems and Components in Nuclear Facilities [75]. The probability of occurrence of the 
defined DBE is therefore equivalent to the probability of DBAs. A minimum seismic input motion, 
consistent with national or international standards, should be considered in the design phase for the 
DBE. The minimum seismic input motion should take into account frequencies of interest for SSCs. 
Structural layout criteria, including structural separation, should follow best engineering practices and 
lessons learned from past earthquakes. 
Modelling of soil-structure interaction (SSI) should be based on geotechnical investigation, and should 
take into account the random nature of soil material properties and inherent uncertainties incorporated 
in soil constitutive models used in the analysis. To account for uncertainties in soil properties, a range 
with at least 3 values (upper limit, best estimate and lower limit) should be taken into account in the 
analysis according to CSA N289.3, Design procedures for seismic qualification of nuclear power 
plants, clause 5.2.3 [73]. 
The analysis of SSI should take into account all effects due to kinematic interaction (effect of applied 
seismic ground motion on massless structure) and inertial interaction (inertial forces developed in the 
structure due to the seismic ground motion). The detail and sophistication of soil-structure models 
should be in accordance with the purposes of the analyses. The frequency range of interest determines 
aspects of the structure model and the SSI model parameters. 
The frequency range of interest should be based on the combination of the frequency range of the 
earthquake input, the soil properties, the frequency range of building response (including response of 
subsystems modelled in the main building or structure model), and the frequency range of the response 
May 2023 
REGDOC-2.5.2, Design of Reactor Facilities, Version 2.1 
67 
 
parameter of interest. Refined finite element meshes and increased analytical rigor are required to 
transmit higher frequencies through the analytical models. 
Damping ratios for structural systems and sub-systems should be taken into account according to 
recognized standards such as ASCE 43-05 [75] and CSA N289.3 [73]. For generating the in-structure 
response spectra to be used as input to the structure mounted systems and components, Response Level 
1 damping of the structure is more appropriate, unless the structure response generally exceeds demand 
over capacity factor given in ASCE 43-05 [75]. 
The seismic design of structural systems should be categorized according to seismic design category 
(SDC) 1 to 5 as per ASCE 43-05 [75]. 
SDC 1 and 2 structural systems should be in accordance with the National Building Code of Canada 
[26], Division B, Part 4. According to the Code, SDC 1 should be as normal and SDC 2 as post-disaster. 
All structures important to safety are classified as SDC 5. However, the designer may still classify some 
structures as SDC 3, 4 and 5 provided that they include proper justification. Guidance on SDC 3, 4 and 
5 (if SDC 3 and 4 are used) structural systems is provided as follows: 
• 
for concrete containment, the design should be based on the American Society of Civil Engineers, 
ASCE 43-05 (SDC 5, limit state D) [79] and CSA N287.3, Design Requirements for Concrete 
Containment Structures for CANDU Nuclear Power Plants [82] 
• 
for steel containment, the design should be based on ASCE 43-05 (SDC 5) [79]; 2010 ASME 
Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code, Section III: Rules for Construction of Nuclear Power Plant 
Components, Division 1, Subsection NE: Class MC Components [34]; and U.S. NRC Regulatory 
Guide 1.57, Design Limits and Loading Combinations for Metal Primary Reactor Containment 
System Components [85] 
• 
for concrete and steel safety related structures, the design should be based on ASCE 
43-05 (SDC 5, 
limit state D) [79] 
• 
CSA N291, Requirements for Safety-Related Structures for CANDU Nuclear Power Plants [86] 
For all safety design categories in a reactor facility, ductility requirements should be in accordance with 
CSA-A23.3, Design of Concrete Structures [76] and CSA S16, Design of Steel Structures [77], 
assuming that the structures are ductile or type D. These ductility requirements should provide margins 
for the BDBE. 
Sub-system analysis should follow the guidance presented for structural systems with the following 
criteria specific to sub-system supports: 
• 
in-structure response spectra 
• 
in-structure time response histories 
The methods of defining in-structure response spectra or in-structure time-histories, as well as 
application of this seismic input to sub-systems and components, should be in accordance with 
ASCE 04, Seismic Analysis for Safety-Related Nuclear Structures [87]. 
Multiple support seismic input of sub-systems and components should take into account their inertial 
and kinematic components. The analysis should follow ASCE 04 [87] or CSA N289.3, Design 
procedures for seismic qualification of nuclear power plants [73]. 
May 2023 
REGDOC-2.5.2, Design of Reactor Facilities, Version 2.1 
68 
 
Determination of the number of earthquake cycles for sub-system analysis should be in accordance with 
U.S. NRC NUREG-0800, Standard Review Plan, section 3.7.3, Seismic Subsystem Analysis, as well as 
seismic analysis of above-ground tanks [88]. 
Seismic design of sub-systems and components should be in accordance with ASCE 43-05, section 
8.2.3 [79], which follows the ASME Code [12]. 
For equipment qualified by testing, multi-axis, multi-frequency testing is acceptable for the DBE in 
accordance with the requirement of IEEE 344-2004 – IEEE Recommended Practice for Seismic 
Qualification of Class 1E Equipment for Nuclear Power Generating Stations [89]; the testing response 
spectrum should be at least a factor of 1.4 times the required response spectrum throughout the 
frequency range. Any deviation from this should be conservatively justified on a case-by-case basis. 
Any evaluation for BDBE should utilize the methodology in Electrical Power Research Institute (EPRI) 
TR-103959, Methodology for Developing Seismic Fragilities [90], to determine if an HCLPF goal is 
met. 
Seismic instrumentation design should follow CSA-N289.5, Seismic Instrumentation Requirements for 
Nuclear Power Plants and Nuclear Facilities [91], which itemizes the requirements for single and 
multiple unit site seismic instrumentation. 
Beyond-design-basis margin should be such that seismically induced SSC failure probabilities do not 
contribute to the total core damage frequency and small and large release frequency to the extent that 
they do not meet the safety goals. To support achievement of the safety goals, the acceptance criterion 
for BDBE should demonstrate that the plant HCLPF is at least 1.67 times the DBE. 
Assessment and validation of margins for beyond-design-basis earthquakes should be considered, 
including the metric HCLPF. 
The seismic isolation of SSCs is an acceptable design approach to limit seismic demand. Seismic 
isolation devices should be designed, manufactured and installed to withstand a seismic action defined 
by a DBE without any failure, preserving its mechanical resistance and full load bearing capacity during 
and after the earthquake. Moreover, the devices and the whole structural system should be designed to 
withstand a BDBE up to 2 times the spectral accelerations of the DBE without major damage and while 
preserving its function. It includes the provisions to accommodate the structural displacements up to 2 
times the displacements under DBE conditions.

In-service testing, maintenance, repair, inspection and monitoring 
In order to maintain the reactor facility within the boundaries of the design, the design shall be such that 
the SSCs important to safety can be calibrated, tested, maintained and repaired (or replaced), inspected, 
and monitored over the lifetime of the plant. 
These activities shall be performed to standards commensurate with the importance of the respective 
safety functions of the SSCs, with no significant reduction in system availability or undue exposure of 
the site personnel to radiation. 
SSCs that have shorter service lifetimes than the plant lifetime shall be identified and described in the 
design documentation. 
In cases where SSCs important to safety cannot be designed to support the desirable testing, inspection, 
or monitoring schedules, 1 of the following approaches shall be taken: 
1. Proven alternative methods, such as surveillance of reference items or use of verified and validated 
calculation methods, shall be specified. 
2. Conservative safety margins shall be applied, or other appropriate precautions shall be taken, to 
compensate for possible unanticipated failures. 
Details of alternate approaches to SSC monitoring shall be provided in the design documentation. 
The design shall provide facilities for monitoring chemical conditions of fluids and of metallic and non-
metallic materials. In addition, the means for adding or modifying the chemical constituents of fluid 
streams shall be specified. 
The design shall identify the needs for related testing when specifying the commissioning requirements 
for the plant. 
May 2023 
REGDOC-2.5.2, Design of Reactor Facilities, Version 2.1 
70 
 
The design shall provide the means to gather baseline data in order to support maintenance-related 
testing, inspection and monitoring. 
Guidance 
While in-service testing, maintenance, repair, inspection and monitoring take place primarily during the 
operating phase of the plant’s lifecycle, the reactor facility is designed to permit the effective 
implementation of these activities during operation. In particular, the reactor core should be designed to 
permit the implementation of a material surveillance program to monitor the effects of service 
conditions on material properties throughout the operating life of the reactor. 
The design should establish a technical basis of SSCs that require in-service testing, maintenance, 
repair, inspection and monitoring. 
The development of strategies and programs to address in-service testing, maintenance, repair, 
inspection and monitoring is a necessary aspect of the plant design phase. The strategies and programs 
to be implemented for these in-service activities should be developed so as to ensure that plant SSCs 
remain capable and available to perform their safety functions. The design should incorporate 
provisions recognizing the need for in-service testing, maintenance, repair, inspection and monitoring, 
as well as to permit the repair, replacement and modification of those SSCs likely to require such 
actions, due to anticipated operating conditions. In addition, activities that need to be carried out during 
the construction and commissioning phases should be identified, in order to provide meaningful 
baseline data of the plant, at the outset of its operating life. 
The strategies should include well-planned and effective programs for evaluating and trending SSC 
performance, coupled with an optimized preventive maintenance program. 
The strategies and programs should demonstrate consideration of the following: 
• 
the intended design life, design loading conditions, operational requirements and safety significance 
of SSCs

Civil structure 
5.15.1 Design 
The reactor facility design shall specify the required performance for the safety functions of the civil 
structures in operational states, DBAs and DECs. 
Civil structures important to safety shall be designed and located so as to minimize the probabilities and 
effects of internal hazards such as fire, explosion, smoke, flooding, missile generation, pipe whip, jet 
impact, or release of fluid due to pipe breaks. 
External hazards such as earthquakes, floods, high winds, tornadoes, tsunamis, and extreme 
meteorological conditions shall be considered in the design of civil structures. 
Settlement analysis and evaluation of soil capacity shall include consideration of the effects of 
fluctuating ground water on the foundations, and identification and evaluation of potential liquefiable 
soil strata and slope failure. 
Civil structures important to safety shall be designed to meet the serviceability, strength, and stability 
requirements for all possible load combinations under the categories of normal operation, AOO, DBA 
and DEC conditions, including external hazards. The serviceability considerations shall include, 
without being limited to, deflection, vibration, permanent deformation, cracking, and settlement. 
The design specifications shall also define all loads and load combinations, with due consideration 
given to the probability of concurrence and loading time history. 
May 2023 
REGDOC-2.5.2, Design of Reactor Facilities, Version 2.1 
72 
 
Environmental effects shall be considered in the design of civil structures and the selection of 
construction materials. The choice of construction material shall be commensurate with the designed 
service life and potential life extension of the plant. 
The plant safety assessment shall include structural analyses for all civil structures important to safety. 
Guidance 
The design authority should provide the design principles, design basis requirements and criteria, 
applicable codes and standards, design and analysis procedures, the assumed boundary conditions and 
the computer codes used in the analysis and design. 
All internal and external hazard loads are specified in section 5.4. Earthquake design input loads and 
impacts of malevolent acts, including large aircraft crash, can be found in sections 5.13 and 5.22, 
respectively. 
Load categories corresponding to the plant states are defined in this section so as to demonstrate 
structural performances as follows: 
• 
normal condition loads expected during the assumed design life of the reactor facility 
• 
AOO loads (or severe environmental loads) 
• 
DBA loads (or abnormal or extreme environmental loads) 
• 
DEC loads (or beyond-design loads) 
The design should identify all DEC loads considered in the structure design and provide the assessment 
methodology and acceptance criteria. 
The structural design should withstand, accommodate or avoid foundation settlement (total and 
differential), according to its performance requirements. 
The structural design should consider the impact of aging on the structure and its material. 
The design should include sufficient safety margins for the buildings and structures that are important 
to safety. 
The physical and material description of each civil structure and its base slab should include:

sections (at least 2 orthogonal directions) 
• 
the relationship between adjacent structures, including any separation or structural ties 
• 
the type of base slab and its arrangement with the methods of transferring horizontal shears (such as 
those seismically induced) to the foundation media 
Containment structure 
The design should specify the safety requirements for the containment building or system, including, 
for example, its structural strength, leak tightness, and resistance to steady-state and transient loads 
(such as those arising from pressure, temperature, radiation, and mechanical impact) that could be 
caused by postulated internal and external hazards. In addition, the design should specify the safety 
requirements and design features for the containment internal structures, such as the reactor vault 
structure, the shielding doors, the airlocks, and the access control and facilities. 
May 2023 
REGDOC-2.5.2, Design of Reactor Facilities, Version 2.1 
73 
 
The design of the containment structure should include: 
• 
base slab and sub-base 
• 
containment wall and dome design 
• 
containment wall openings and penetrations 
• 
pre-stressing system 
• 
containment liner and its attachment method 
The design pressure of the containment building should be determined by increasing, by at least 10%, 
the peak pressure that would be generated by the DBA (refer to clause 4.49 of IAEA NS-G-1.10, 
Design of Reactor Containment Systems for Nuclear Power Plants) [120]. 
Ultimate internal pressure capacity should be provided for the containment building structures, 
including containment penetrations. 
If the containment building foundation is a common mat slab that is not separated from the other 
building foundation, the impact should be evaluated. 
Concrete containment structures should be designed and constructed in accordance with the CSA N287 
series [78], as applicable: 
• 
N287.1, General Requirements for Concrete Containment Structures for CANDU Nuclear Power 
Plants, for general requirements in documentation of design specification and design reports [79]

inspection [83] 
• 
N287.6, Pre-operational proof and leakage rate testing requirements for concrete containment 
structures for nuclear power plants, for pressure test before operation [84] 
Steel containment structures should be designed according to the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel 
Code [33], Section III, Division 1, Subsection NE, Class MC Components or equivalent standard. 
Stability of the containment vessel and appurtenances should be evaluated using ASME Code Case N-
284-1, Metal Containment Shell Buckling Design Methods, Section III, Division 1, Class MC [119]. 
For other requirements on the design of containment structures, refer to section 6.6.2 of this regulatory 
document.

5.15.2 Surveillance 
The design shall enable implementation of periodic inspection programs for structures important to 
safety in order to verify that the as-constructed structures meet their functional and performance 
requirements. 
The design shall also facilitate in-service monitoring for degradations that may compromise the 
intended design function of the structures. In particular, the design shall permit monitoring of 
foundation settling. 
Pressure and leak testing shall be conducted on applicable structures to demonstrate that the respective 
design parameters comply with requirements. 
The design shall facilitate routine inspection of sea, lake, and river flood defences and demonstrate 
fitness for service. 
Guidance 
For concrete containments, it is important to accommodate the structural integrity inspection and 
pressure testing for pre-operational and in-service phases. The inspection and pressure testing programs 
should be provided and meet the applicable requirements listed in CSA N287.6, Pre- operational proof 
and leakage rate testing requirements for concrete containment structures for nuclear power plants 
[83], and CSA N287.7, In-service examination and testing requirements for concrete containment 
structures for CANDU nuclear power plants [114]. 
Special design provisions should be made to accommodate in-service inspection and pressure testing of 
concrete containments (e.g., providing sufficient physical access, providing alternative means for 
May 2023 
REGDOC-2.5.2, Design of Reactor Facilities, Version 2.1 
75 
 
identification of conditions that can lead to degradation in inaccessible areas, or providing remote visual 
monitoring of high-radiation areas). Programs should be implemented for the examination of 
inaccessible areas, monitoring of ground water chemistry, and monitoring of settlements and 
differential displacements. The design should also provide for equipment and instrumentations, such as 
a strain gauge, to monitor stress, strain and any deformation of the structures. 
5.15.3 Lifting and handling of large loads 
The lifting and handling of large and heavy loads, particularly those containing radioactive material, 
shall be considered in the reactor facility design. This shall include identification of the large loads, 
traversing routes and situations where they need to be lifted over areas of the plant that are critical to 
safety. The design of all cranes and lifting devices shall, therefore, incorporate large margins, 
appropriate interlocks, and other safety features to accommodate the lifting of large loads. 
The drop of large loads lifted and handled in areas where there are systems and components that are 
important to safety shall be taken into account in the design. The potential load due to the large load 
drop shall be taken into account in the analysis of DBAs. 
5.16 
Construction and commissioning 
SSCs important to safety shall be designed so that they can be manufactured, constructed, assembled, 
installed and erected in accordance with established processes that ensure that the design will achieve 
the required level of safety. 
All plant systems shall be designed such that, to the greatest extent practicable, commissioning tests can 
be performed to confirm that design requirements have been achieved. 
The design shall include provisions to facilitate the commissioning activities. In particular, the design of 
the I&C systems shall make provisions for start-up neutron sources and dedicated start-up 
instrumentation for conditions in which they are needed. 
The design shall specify commissioning requirements including data to be recorded and retained. In 
particular, the design shall clearly identify any non-standard or special commissioning requirements, 
which shall be specified in design documentation. 
Guidance 
Due account should be taken of relevant experience that has been gained in the construction and 
commissioning of other similar plants and their associated SSCs. Where best practices from other 
relevant industries are adopted, such practices should be shown to be appropriate to the specific nuclear 
application. 
The design should include preliminary plant commissioning requirements for both pre-operational and 
initial start-up tests: 
• 
Pre-operational tests consist of those tests conducted following completion of construction and 
construction-related inspections and tests, but before fuel loading. Such tests demonstrate, to the 
extent practicable, the capability of SSCs to meet performance requirements and design criteria. 
• 
Initial start-up tests include those test activities scheduled to be performed during and following 
fuel loading. Testing activities include fuel loading, pre-critical tests, initial criticality, low-power 
tests, and power ascension tests, which should confirm the design bases and demonstrate, to the 
extent practicable, that the plant will operate in accordance with its design and is capable of 
responding as designed to AOOs, DBAs and DECs. 
May 2023 
REGDOC-2.5.2, Design of Reactor Facilities, Version 2.1 
76 
 
The design authority should provide general guidance to control commissioning activities, including 
administrative controls that will be used to develop, review and approve individual test procedures, 
coordination with organizations involved in the test program, participation of plant operational and 
technical staff, and the review, evaluation and approval of test results. 
The design should include general guidance about how (and to what extent) the test program will use 
and test the plant’s operating, surveillance and emergency procedures. 
The design should include test abstracts of SSCs and unique design features, which will be tested to 
verify that SSC performance is in accordance with the design. These test abstracts should include the 
objectives, pre-requisites, test methods, and acceptance criteria that will be included in the test 
procedures. 
The design should include the acceptance criteria for commissioning activities that are necessary and 
sufficient to provide reasonable assurance that, if these commissioning activities are performed and the 
acceptance criteria met, the as-built facility will conform to the approved plant design and applicable 
regulations. 
The scope of the acceptance criteria should be consistent with the SSCs that are in the design 
descriptions. In general, each system should have sufficient acceptance criteria that verify the 
information in the design descriptions. The level of detail specified in the acceptance criteria should be 
commensurate with the safety significance of the functions and bases of that SSC. 
The acceptance criteria should be objective and unambiguous, match the design commitments, and be 
verifiable by adequate inspections, tests, and analyses during the construction and commissioning 
stages.

Aging and wear 
The design shall take due account of the effects of aging and wear on SSCs. For SSCs important to 
safety, this shall include: 
1. an assessment of design margins, taking into account all known aging and wear mechanisms and 
potential degradation in operational states, including the effects of testing and maintenance 
processes 
2. provisions for monitoring, testing, sampling, and inspecting SSCs so as to assess aging 
mechanisms, verify predictions, and identify unanticipated behaviours or degradation that may 
occur during operation, as a result of aging and wear

Guidance 
The design should also consider the following: 
• 
identification of all SSCs subject to aging management 
• 
use of advanced materials with greater aging resistant properties 
• 
need for materials testing programs to monitor aging degradation 
• 
need to incorporate online monitoring, particularly where this technology would provide 
forewarning of degradation leading to failure of SSCs, and where the consequences of failure could 
be significant to safety 
5.18 
Control of foreign material 
The design shall provide for the detection, exclusion and removal of all foreign material and corrosion 
products that may have an impact on safety. 
5.19 
Transport and packaging for fuel and radioactive waste 
The design shall incorporate appropriate features to facilitate the transport and handling of new fuel, 
irradiated fuel, and radioactive waste in accordance with the requirements of the Packaging and 
Transport of Nuclear Substances Regulations. Related considerations shall include facility access, as 
well as lifting and packaging capabilities. 
5.20 
Escape routes and means of communication 
The design shall provide a sufficient number of safe escape routes that will be available in operational 
states, DBAs and DECs, including seismic events. These routes shall be identified with clear and 
durable signage, emergency lighting, ventilation and other building services essential to their safe use. 
Escape routes shall be subject to the relevant Canadian requirements for radiation zoning, fire 
protection, industrial safety, and plant security, which include assurance of the ability to escape from 
containment regardless of the pressure in containment. 
Suitable alarm systems and means of communication shall be available at all times to warn and instruct 
all persons in the plant and on the site. 
The design shall ensure that diverse methods of communication are available within the reactor facility 
and in the immediate vicinity, as well as to offsite agencies, in accordance with the emergency response 
plan.

5.21 
Human factors 
The design shall include a human factors engineering program plan. Relevant and proven systematic 
analysis techniques shall be used to address human factors issues within the design process. 
Human factors considerations: 
1. reduce the likelihood of human error as far as reasonably achievable 
2. provide means for identifying the occurrence of human error, and methods by which to recover 
from such an error 
3. mitigate the consequences of error 
The human factors engineering program shall also facilitate the interface between the operating 
personnel and the plant by promoting attention to plant layout and procedures, maintenance, inspection, 
training, and the application of ergonomic principles to the design of working areas and working 
environments. 
Appropriate and clear distinction between the functions assigned to operating personnel and those 
assigned to automatic systems shall be facilitated by systematic consideration of human factors and the 
human-system interface. This consideration shall continue in an iterative way throughout the entire 
design process. 
The human-system interfaces in the main control room, the secondary control room, the emergency 
support facilities, and in the plant shall provide operators with necessary and appropriate information in 
a usable format that is compatible with the necessary decision and action times. 
Human factors verification and validation plans shall be established for all appropriate stages of the 
design process so as to confirm that the design adequately accommodates all necessary operator actions. 
To assist in the establishment of design criteria for information display and controls, each operator shall 
be considered to have dual roles: that of a systems manager (including responsibility for accident 
management) and that of an equipment operator. Verification and validation activities shall be 
comprehensive, such that the design conforms to human factors design principles and meets usability 
requirements. 
The design shall identify the type of information that facilitates an operator’s ability to readily: 
1. assess the general state of the plant, whether in operational states, DBAs or DECs 
2. confirm that the designed automatic safety actions are being carried out 
3. determine the appropriate operator-initiated safety actions to be taken 
The design shall provide the type of information that enables an equipment operator to identify the 
parameters associated with individual plant systems and equipment, and to confirm that the necessary 
safety actions can be initiated safely. 
Design goals shall include promoting the success of operator action with due regard for the time 
available for response, the physical environment to be expected, and the associated psychological 
demands made on the operator. 
 
 
May 2023 
REGDOC-2.5.2, Design of Reactor Facilities, Version 2.1 
79 
 
The need for operator intervention on a short time scale shall be kept to a minimum. Where such 
intervention is necessary, the following conditions shall apply: 
1. the information necessary for the operator to make the decision to act is presented simply and 
unambiguously 
2. the operator has sufficient time to make a decision and to act 
3. following an event, the physical environment is acceptable in the main control room or in the 
secondary control room, and in the access route to the secondary control room 
Guidance 
This section applies to the design of all plant systems where there are human factors (HF) 
considerations. Human factors means “factors that influence human performance,” as defined in CNSC 
REGDOC-2.2.1, Human Factors [136]. In practice, it is expected that most plant systems will require 
some consideration of HF. 
The systematic approaches and processes taken for HF in design should meet international standards 
and good practices. HF codes and standards that are used by the design authority for the plant design 
should be identified and evaluated for their suitability, applicability, sufficiency and adequacy. 
There should be sufficient authority in the management of HF in design to ensure that HF 
considerations that influence safety are adequately taken into account. HF design requirements that will 
supplement the codes (e.g., concerning usability and human performance) should also be identified and 
specified early in the design stage process. 
The following areas should have interfaces with HF in design: 
• 
engineering design of specific SSCs 
• 
procedure development 
• 
training development 
• 
consideration of human actions in safety analyses 
• 
specifications of staffing and minimum shift complement 
The design expectations are provided below for use in different design stages. 
Planning 
A human factors engineering program plan demonstrates how HF considerations are incorporated into 
the design activities. Further guidance on how to develop such a plan is provided in REGDOC-2.5.1, 
General Design Considerations: Human Factors [130] and U.S. NRC NUREG-0711, Revision 2, 
Human Factors Engineering Program Review Model [131]. The technical elements described in the 
plan should be supported by subsequent verification and validation activities for the resulting design, as 
described in REGDOC-2.5.1, General Design Considerations: Human Factors [130]. 
The HF in design activities are effectively integrated in the overall engineering design process and 
incorporated early enough to make an effective contribution to safety. There should be a sufficient 
number of trained, qualified and experienced HF specialists to carry out the HF in design activities 
provided that established criteria pertaining to system complexity and importance to safety are met. 
May 2023 
REGDOC-2.5.2, Design of Reactor Facilities, Version 2.1 
80 
 
Analysis 
Systematic analytical approaches are used to establish the HF inputs. Such analyses should be 
conducted from the earliest stages of design, to provide a strong foundation upon which the design 
solutions are based. The specific HF analyses should: 
• 
be appropriate to the activities that they cover, considering the risk of the activities and the novelty 
of the design 
• 
be carried out throughout the development of the design 
• 
use methods, techniques, and good practices that are considered acceptable by trained and 
experienced human factors specialists 
• 
share the information between groups engaged in different parts of the design 
The HF analyses could include: 
• 
function analysis 
• 
task analysis 
• 
human reliability analysis 
• 
hazard analysis 
• 
link analysis 
• 
information requirements analysis 
• 
staffing analysis 
• 
usability analysis 
• 
operability and maintainability analysis 
The design should also provide research or study reports for any work carried out as part of the process 
of developing and testing any human-system interface technologies (e.g., displays and controls) that are 
new to reactor facility applications and that may have a bearing on safety. 
The design should demonstrate that steps have been taken in developing the design to reduce or 
eliminate, where practicable, the potential for human error; that there are acceptable means by which to 
identify error; that methods are provided by which to recover from the error; and that the consequences 
of error can be mitigated. 
Design 
There should be evidence that a systematic process exists for the design of work areas, work 
environments, and human-system interfaces for SSCs throughout the plant. The design should 
demonstrate consideration of HF issues for all aspects of the plant, not just control areas. HF aspects 
should be considered where off-the-shelf SSCs are specified and procured. Operating experience 
concerning HF issues gained from existing or similar systems should be considered in the design. 
A significant aspect of this systematic process is the use of modern human factors codes, standards, and 
good practices in developing the design. Guidance is provided in U.S. NRC NUREG-0700 Revision 2, 
Human-System Interface Design Review Guidelines. 
The design should demonstrate that operators (and any other potential users) in the main control room, 
the secondary control room, the emergency support facilities, and in the plant are provided with the 
necessary and appropriate information in a format that is compatible with necessary decision and action 
times. The same kind of considerations should apply to other users of equipment (e.g., maintainers and 
technicians) elsewhere in the plant. 
May 2023 
REGDOC-2.5.2, Design of Reactor Facilities, Version 2.1 
81 
 
Operating personnel 
Personnel who have operating experience from similar plants should be actively involved in the design 
process to ensure that consideration is given as early as possible to the future operation and 
maintenance of the SSCs. 
Formal interfaces should be defined between the HF in design group(s) and the various design 
engineering groups involved in the design process; this facilitates interactions and sharing of 
information to achieve good integration of HF considerations in the design. 
Verification and validation 
Evaluations are an essential part of HF in the design process and include both verification and 
validation activities. Evaluation criteria (i.e., design requirements and standards) should be established 
prior to conducting these evaluations. 
HF verification activities should be carried out (generally by vendor and licensee) to confirm that the 
design conforms to HF design standards and has been implemented as intended in the plant. 
Validations should be carried out iteratively at various stages of the design process, ensuring that the 
task fidelity is appropriate. Data from the validation activities should be analyzed and the results should 
be used to improve the design. Validation should confirm that the system, including the human 
components and procedures to support the tasks, meets the specified system and usability requirements. 
Validations should also demonstrate that operations and maintenance personnel can successfully carry 
out their tasks in a safe manner. 
Guidance on evaluations is provided in REGDOC-2.5.1, General Design Considerations: Human 
Factors [130], and U.S. NRC NUREG-6393, Integrated System Validation: Methodology and Review 
Criteria [135].

Robustness against malevolent acts 
The design shall provide physical features, such as protection against design-basis threats, in 
accordance with the requirements of the Nuclear Security Regulations. 
Guidance on robustness against malevolent acts 
The engineering safety aspects of robustness and protection from malevolent acts should account for: 
• 
basic design approach 
• 
structural performance objectives 
• 
threat characterization 
• 
loading development 
• 
material properties 
• 
principles of analysis and design 
• 
structural acceptance criteria 
• 
design of SSCs 
The basis for identifying malevolent acts considered in the design is the potential to cause a release of 
radioactivity to the public and the environment. 
5.22.1 Design principles 
The design shall be such that the reactor facility and any other onsite facilities with potential to release 
large amounts of radioactive material or energy are protected against malevolent acts. 
Threats from credible malevolent acts are referred to as design-basis threats (DBTs). More severe but 
unlikely threats are referred to as beyond-design-basis threats (BDBTs). Both types of threats shall be 
considered in the design. 
Threats identified as DBTs shall have credible attributes and characteristics of potential insider or 
external adversaries, who might attempt unauthorized removal of nuclear material or sabotage against 
which a physical protection system is designed and evaluated. 
BDBTs are threats too unlikely to warrant incorporation into the design basis, but for which the 
consequences shall be assessed in order to establish means of mitigation to the extent practicable. 
Consistent with the concept of defence in depth, the design shall provide multiple barriers for protection 
against malevolent acts, including physical protection systems, engineered safety provisions, and 
measures for post-event management, as appropriate. The failure of a preceding barrier shall not 
compromise the integrity and effectiveness of subsequent barriers.

Guidance 
The identification of vital areas involves the identification and location of SSCs that require protection, 
in order to prevent significant radioactive releases. The vital areas include the reactor building and the 
spent fuel pool, including the structure housing the spent fuel pool. The protection measures for these 
identified vital areas should be assessed. 
Based on identified threats, the DBT and BDBT sets of load cases should be selected. Each load case 
selected should be the worst-case scenario for a given threat. 
5.22.2 Design methods 
The design authority shall develop a methodology for assessing the challenges imposed by DBTs and 
evaluating the capabilities for meeting these challenges (e.g., as identified in an initial threat and risk 
assessment). The methodology shall apply conservative design measures and sound engineering 
practices. 
The plant design shall take into account the role of structures, pathways, equipment, and 
instrumentation in providing detection, delay, and response to threats. 
Vital areas shall be identified and taken into account in the design and verification of robustness. For 
vital areas, the design shall allow enough delay for effective intervention by the onsite or offsite 
response force, taking structures, detection and assessment into account. These areas shall, to the extent 
practicable, be protected from inadvertent damage while performing defensive actions. 
The design shall provide appropriate means for access control and detection, and for minimizing the 
number of access and egress points to protected areas. Such points shall include storm sewers, culverts, 
service piping, and cable routing that could be used to gain access to the facility. 
The design shall also take into account the placement of civil utilities to minimize access requirements 
for such activities as repair and maintenance, in order to reduce threats to protected areas and vital 
areas. 
The design authority shall also develop a methodology for assessing the challenges associated with 
BDBTs. This methodology shall be applied to determine the margins available for shutdown, fuel 
cooling and confinement of radioactivity. Significant degradation of engineering means may be 
permitted. 
Guidance 
Vital areas are designed using the tiered approach related to the threat level as described below. 
For the loadings induced by DBT, the structural design methodology applies conservative design 
measures and sound engineering practices that meet codes and standards. 
For the first-tier BDBT (events more severe than DBT), sufficient structural integrity to protect 
important systems should be provided. The design code criteria may be relaxed; however, the design 
methodology should be followed. 
For the second-tier BDBT (extreme events), degradation of the containment barrier may be accepted; 
however, the degradation should be limited. The structures of vital areas should be designed for the 
second-tier BDBT that may exceed design code limits but must stay within documented material and 
structural limits.

The aircraft crash loading functions related to DBTs and BDBTs are “classified,” and are available to 
licensees and applicants upon request to the CNSC. 
It is acceptable to model the whole aircraft as a load that impacts the structure. However, the design 
should be such that the loading functions due to the crash of the modelled aircraft against a rigid target 
envelope are acceptable. 
Two distinct types of structural failure modes should be reviewed: local (punching - brittle) failure and 
global (flexural-plastic) failure. The loading characteristics and structural behaviour for these 2 failure 
modes are different, and should be reviewed separately. However, it should be noted that, in some 
cases, these 2 failure modes (e.g., an aircraft crash) may act simultaneously or quasi-simultaneously. 
Local structural behaviours under a malevolent-act-induced loading case should be assessed. Local 
damage to the target can be defined using the following descriptions: 
• 
penetration – the depth of the crater due to the missile impact 
• 
spalling – the ejection of the target material from the front face of the target (impacted face) 
• 
scabbing – the ejection of material from the rear face of the target 
• 
just perforation – the missile just penetrates the target with residual velocity equal to 0  
Most technical references consider engines, in the case of an aircraft crash, as the critical missiles. 
Such local damage modes would not, in general, result in structural collapse, but they may cause 
damage to safety-related systems or components. Application of empirical formulae for perforation and 
scabbing is an acceptable approach to assess structural behaviour under local, concentrated loading. 
Global structural response effects refer to the overall building behaviour in response to the applied 
impact loading. The global response can be characterized by major structural damage, such as 
significant perforation or collapse of large portions of the building walls, floors, and load carrying 
frames. The impact could also potentially induce significant vibrations or “shock loading” throughout 
the building. 
In the case of an aircraft crash, in the absence of adequate design measures, local damage associated 
with the impact of a missile into the wall could result in scabbing of concrete from the rear face. 
Ultimately, it could result in local fracture of rebar, allowing perforation of the wall by the residual 
crushed engine mass and remaining portion of the shaft. Global structural damage, however, is 
generally associated with the deformation of the entire structural system. Adequate design measures 
should be provided to meet the acceptance criteria set out in section 5.22.3. 
The design of the facility’s physical protection system should consider changes in threat, enhanced 
understanding of the potential vulnerabilities of the facility and its systems and structures, and advances 
in physical protection approaches, systems, and technologies. 
5.22.3 Acceptance criteria 
All safety system functions and capabilities shall continue to be available for DBTs. 
The design shall provide for the ongoing availability of fundamental safety functions during BDBTs; 
these provisions will depend on the severity of the threat. 
 
May 2023 
REGDOC-2.5.2, Design of Reactor Facilities, Version 2.1 
85 
 
For more severe events, there shall be a safe shutdown path that comprises at least 1 means for each of 
the following: 
1. reactor shutdown 
2. fuel cooling 
3. retention of radioactivity from the reactor 
There shall be sufficient structural integrity to protect important systems. Two such success paths shall 
be identified where practical. 
For extreme events, there shall be at least 1 means of reactor shutdown and core cooling. Degradation 
of the containment barrier may allow the release of radioactive material; however, the degradation shall 
be limited. In these cases, the response shall include onsite and offsite emergency measures. 
Guidance 
The acceptance criteria for both local and global behaviour should be satisfied simultaneously. 
The structural acceptance criteria for local behaviour should include the following: 
• 
For DBTs, there should be no scabbing of the rear face of structural elements, possibly with limited, 
easily repairable, superficial spalling of concrete. 
• 
For severe BDBTs, there should be no scabbing of the rear face of structural elements, or possible 
limited scabbing (concrete cover), if confined by the steel liner. The steel liner should remain leak-
tight. 
• 
For extreme BDBTs, there should be no perforation, according to the applicable formula with a 
corresponding increase factor of 1.2 applied to the calculated thickness. 
Further detailed guidance on structural analysis of containment structures is given in Appendix A. 
Further information on the design and construction of containment and other safety-related structures 
can be found in the CSA N287 series of standards [146], and in CSA N291, Requirements for Safety-
Related Structures for CANDU Nuclear Power Plants [86], respectively.

5.22.4 Cyber security 
The design of computer-based I&C systems important to safety shall provide a cyber security defensive 
architecture. 
Computer-based I&C systems and components important to safety shall be protected from cyber attacks 
in order to maintain confidentiality, integrity and availability. 
A cyber security program shall be developed, implemented and maintained so as to achieve the security 
required in each phase of the computer-based I&C systems’ lifecycle. 
Cyber security features shall not adversely affect the functions or performance of SSCs important to 
safety. 
Guidance 
The security of computer-based I&C systems is designed to provide a secure operational environment 
with defensive features, and to protect against cyber attacks. Applicable codes and standards should be 
used, and industry best practices should be consulted. 
The design of a cyber security program should consider: 
• 
documentation for how the design authority establishes, implements and maintains the program to 
provide a high level of assurance that the systems subject to security protective measures are 
protected 
• 
application of defence-in-depth protective strategies to provide a high level of assurance that the 
program has adequate cyber security capability 
• 
addressing potential security vulnerabilities in each phase of the computer-based I&C systems 
lifecycle for computer-based systems important to safety 
• 
inclusion of security controls for a secure development environment during the development phases 
A site-specific program should include the following elements: 
• 
defensive strategy 
• 
asset identification and security controls 
• 
roles and responsibilities 
• 
policies and procedures 
May 2023 
REGDOC-2.5.2, Design of Reactor Facilities, Version 2.1 
87 
 
• 
awareness and training 
• 
configuration management 
• 
information protection 
• 
coordination with other security programs 
• 
incident reporting and recovery plan 
• 
program maintenance 
The defensive architecture should have cyber security defensive levels separated by security 
boundaries. The systems requiring the greatest degree of security should be located within the most 
secure boundaries. 
The design authority should identify the design features that provide a secure operational environment 
for the systems important to safety. 
Security design requirements for computer-based I&C systems should be informed by vulnerability 
analyses. Vulnerabilities addressed in the design should include: 
• deficiencies in the design that may allow inadvertent, unintended, or unauthorized access or 
modifications to the systems (hardware and software), which may degrade the reliability, integrity 
or functionality of the systems during operations 
• non-performance of the safety functions by the systems in the presence of undesired behaviour by 
connected systems 
The following should be considered for the protection of computer-based I&C systems and 
components important to safety functions: 
• The computer-based I&C systems and components important to safety should be protected, along 
with those support systems and components that, if compromised, would adversely affect safety 
functions. 
• Cyber-attacks should include either physical or logical threats (with either malicious or non- 
malicious intent), originating from inside and outside of the perimeter of the system’s facility. 
• Computer-based systems and components should include computer hardware, software, firmware, 
and interfaces. 
• Both autonomous and non-autonomous computer-based systems or components subject to cyber 
security should be protected. 
• Computer-based systems and components for the functions of emergency preparedness systems, 
physical security and safeguards should be protected, if applicable for the design. 
The computer-based I&C systems important to safety should be protected from physical attacks and 
unauthorized physical or logical access, and should meet the following expectations: 
• All systems, components and network cabling important to safety should be installed in a plant 
location that physically secures the equipment. 
• Effective methods should be used, such as including appropriate combinations of programmatic 
controls and physical security measures (e.g., locked enclosures, locked rooms, alarms on 
enclosure doors). 
• Unnecessary or unauthorized access to the set point adjustments and calibration adjustments should 
be limited. 
• Connections needed for temporary use should be disabled when not in use (e.g., connection of 
maintenance and development computers). 
• Unused data connections should be disabled. 
May 2023 
REGDOC-2.5.2, Design of Reactor Facilities, Version 2.1 
88 
 
• All data connections for systems and components should be placed within enclosures 
• Any remote access to the safety system from a computer located in an area with less physical 
security than the safety system should be limited. 
• Access to the safety systems should be logged, and the security logs should be checked periodically 
• Wireless communication should not be implemented for safety systems. 
• Safety systems should be designed such that virus protection software is not required. 
• Dedicated communication of plant data between the plant and the emergency support facilities 
(either onsite or offsite) should be provided using secure protocols. 
Security functions and security supporting functions of I&C systems should not adversely affect the 
functions of systems and components important to safety. The design should ensure that neither the 
operation nor failure of security measures implemented will adversely affect the ability of the systems 
important to safety. 
Implementation of any individual security control or function, or of the complete set of applied controls 
for safety systems, should consider the following: 
• Implementation should not adversely impact performance, including response time, effectiveness or 
operation of safety functions. 
• Where practical, implementation directly in the safety system should be avoided. 
• If implemented in safety system displays and controls, the security control should not adversely 
impact the operator’s ability to maintain the safety of the plant. 
• 
If implemented within a safety system, adequate measures should be taken to ensure that the 
security controls do not adversely affect the ability of the system to perform its safety functions. 
• 
Security controls within a safety system should be developed and qualified to the same level of 
qualification as the system in which the control resides. 
Provisions should be made for periodic and post-maintenance verification, to confirm that the security 
features are properly configured and operating.

Safeguards 
Reactor facilities are subject to the obligations arising from Canada’s international agreements, and to 
requirements pertaining to safeguards and non-proliferation. 
The design and the design process shall ensure compliance with the obligations arising from the 
safeguards agreement between Canada and the IAEA. These features allow for the permanent 
May 2023 
REGDOC-2.5.2, Design of Reactor Facilities, Version 2.1 
89 
 
installation of safeguards equipment and the provision of services required for the ongoing operation of 
that equipment. 
Guidance 
For the purposes of this document, the term “safeguards” denotes a system of inspection and other 
verification activities undertaken by IAEA in order to evaluate a state’s compliance with its obligations, 
pursuant to its safeguards agreement with the IAEA, under the Treaty on the Non- Proliferation of 
Nuclear Weapons. The objective of the Canada-IAEA safeguards agreement is for the IAEA to provide 
annual assurance to Canada and to the international community that all declared nuclear material is 
employed in peaceful, non-explosive uses, and that there is no indication of undeclared nuclear material 
or activities. 
The CNSC is the governmental authority responsible for implementing the Canada-IAEA safeguards 
agreement. 
Safeguards considerations should be integrated during the early design phase of a new reactor facility. 
This approach is a well-established practice in the Canadian nuclear industry and can avoid the 
retrofitting of safeguards equipment after a design is completed, which could otherwise result in 
substantial cost increases in terms of redesign work, timeline extensions and additional demands on 
human resources. If there is a requirement to install IAEA safeguards equipment to monitor nuclear 
material flows and inventories, accurate plant layout requirements should be identified early in the 
process, so as to ensure that appropriate “design space” is allocated for critical safeguards installations 
equipment.

5.24 
Decommissioning 
Future plant decommissioning and dismantling activities shall be taken into account, such that: 
1. materials are selected for the construction and fabrication of plant components and structures with 
the purpose of minimizing eventual quantities of radioactive waste and assisting decontamination 
2. plant layout is designed to facilitate access for decommissioning or dismantling activities, including 
for plants with multiple units at a site, in periods when some units are operating and some are under 
decommissioning 
3. consideration is given to the future potential requirements for storage of radioactive waste generated 
as a result of new facilities being built, or existing facilities being expanded 
Guidance 
Future plant decommissioning and dismantling activities considered at the design phase should include 
considerations of experience gained from the decommissioning of existing plants, as well as those 
plants that are in long-term safe storage. Experience suggests that the decommissioning of reactor 
facilities could be facilitated if it received greater attention at the design stage. The consideration of 
decommissioning at the design stage is expected to result in lower worker doses and reduced 
environmental impacts.

5.25 
Provision for extended shutdown 
Provision shall be made in the design to meet the needs arising in long shutdown periods, such as the 
needs for maintaining the conditions of the nuclear fuel, the coolant or the moderator; for the 
inspection, periodic testing and maintenance of the relevant SSCs of the facility; and for providing 
physical protection. Special consideration shall be given to long-lived neutron poisons, which may 
affect the restarting of the reactor. 
5.26 
Provision for utilization and modification 
Where appropriate, special precautions shall be taken in the design in relation to the utilization and 
modification of the reactor facility to ensure that the configuration of the reactor facility is known at all 
times, and that the safety case is valid for that configuration. 
The safety case shall be made with consideration of utilization of equipment included in the reactor 
facility as it can: 
• 
cause hazards directly if it fails 
• 
cause hazards indirectly by affecting the safe operation of the reactor 
• 
increase the hazard due to an initiating event by its consequent failure and the effects on the event 
sequence 
Every proposed utilization or modification of equipment (e.g., experimental devices) included in the 
reactor facility that may have a major significance for safety shall be designed in accordance with the 
same principles as applied to the reactor facility. In particular, all experimental devices using the reactor 
shall be designed to standards equivalent to those applied to the reactor itself, and shall be fully 
compatible in terms of the materials used, the structural integrity and the provision for radiation 
protection. Further requirements for the design of experimental devices are in Appendix B. 
Where experimental devices penetrate the reactor boundaries, they shall be designed to preserve the 
means of confinement and shielding of the reactor. Safety systems for experimental devices shall be 
designed to protect both the device and the reactor. 
Where appropriate, the safety case shall also be made with consideration of utilization or modification 
of equipment that is not part of the reactor facility (e.g., independent adjacent facilities making use of 
heat, steam or power produced by the reactor facility).

6. 
System-specific requirements 
6.1 
Reactor core 
Reactor core parameters and their limits shall be specified. The design shall consider all foreseeable 
reactor core configurations for normal operation. 
The reactor core, including the fuel elements, reactivity control mechanisms, reflectors, fuel channel 
and structural parts, shall be designed so that the reactor can be shut down, cooled and held subcritical 
with an adequate margin in operational states, DBAs and DECs. 
The design of the reactor core shall incorporate safety margins as part of defence in depth to ensure that 
the permissible design limits, taking into account engineering tolerances and uncertainties associated 
with reactor behaviour under accident conditions, are not exceeded. 
The anticipated upper limit of possible deformation or other changes due to irradiation conditions shall 
be evaluated. These evaluations shall be supported by data from experiments, and from experience with 
irradiation. The design shall provide protection against those deformations, or any other changes to 
reactor structures that have the potential to adversely affect the behaviour of the core or associated 
systems. 
The reactor core and associated structures and cooling systems shall: 
1. withstand static and dynamic loading, including thermal expansion and contraction 
2. withstand vibration (such as flow-induced and acoustic vibration) 
3. ensure chemical compatibility, including service-related contaminants 
4. meet thermal material limits 
5. meet radiation damage limits 
The reactor core design shall include provisions for a guaranteed shutdown state as described in 
section 5.11. 
The shutdown margin for all shutdown states shall be such that the core will remain subcritical for any 
credible changes in the core configuration and reactivity addition. 
If operator intervention is required to keep the reactor in a shutdown state, the feasibility, timeliness, 
and effectiveness of such intervention shall be demonstrated. 
The core design shall include provisions for monitoring, surveillance, inspections, tests, analyses and 
commissioning programs, as well as periodic verification and testing programs to ensure that the reactor 
facility performs as designed and meets designer-specified acceptance criteria. 
Guidance on nuclear design 
The design of the reactor core should provide confidence that the permissible design limits under 
operational states, DBAs and DECs are not exceeded, taking into account engineering tolerances and 
uncertainties associated with the calculations. 
The nuclear design deals with flux and power distribution within the reactor core, the design and use of 
reactivity control systems for normal operation and for shutting down the reactor, core stability, the 
various reactivity feedback characteristics, and the physics of the fuel. 
May 2023 
REGDOC-2.5.2, Design of Reactor Facilities, Version 2.1 
92 
 
The design of the reactor core and associated coolant and fuel systems should take into account all 
practical means so that, in the power operating range, the net effect of the prompt inherent nuclear 
feedback characteristics tends to compensate for a rapid increase in reactivity and power. The 
consequences of those accidents that would be aggravated by a positive reactivity feedback should be 
either acceptable, or be satisfactorily mitigated by other design features. 
The design should take into account measurements made in previous reactors and critical experiments 
and their use in the uncertainty analyses. The design should define the measurements to be made, 
including start-up confirmatory tests and periodically required measurements. 
The design should provide for I&C to: 
• 
maintain the variables and systems within prescribed operating ranges 
• 
monitor variables and systems that can affect the fission process over anticipated ranges for 
operational states, DBAs and DECs 
These I&Cs should be demonstrated to be effective. 
Defence in depth 
The nuclear design should incorporate inherently safe features to reduce the reliance on engineered 
safety systems or operational procedures. Defence in depth and related principles should be applied in 
the design of the reactivity control safety function, such that the fission chain reaction is controlled 
during operational states, and, when necessary, terminated for DBAs and DECs. 
The nuclear design should provide for effective means to ensure success of the following safety 
functions to: 
• 
prevent unacceptable reactivity transients 
• 
shut down the reactor as necessary to prevent progression of AOOs to DBAs, or DBAs to DECs 
• 
maintain and monitor the reactor in a safe shutdown state 
Core power densities and distributions 
The design limits for the power densities and power distributions should be determined from an 
integrated consideration of fuel design limits, thermal limits, decay heat limits, and AOO and accident 
analyses. For power distribution, the reactor core design should demonstrate the following: 
• 
There is a high level of confidence that the proposed design limits can be met within the expected 
operational range of the reactor, taking into account: 
• 
the analytical methods and data for the design calculations 
• 
uncertainty analyses and experimental comparisons presented for the design calculations 
• 
the sufficiency of design cases calculated covering times in the fuel reload cycle, or during on-
power fueling (depending upon the reactor design, reactivity device configurations, and load-
follow transients) 
• 
special problems (such as power spikes due to densification), possible asymmetries, and 
misaligned reactivity devices 
• 
There is a high level of confidence that, during normal operation, the design limits will not be 
exceeded, based on consideration of information received from the power distribution monitoring 
instrumentation. The processing of that information should include: 
• 
calculations (instrument-calculation correlations) involved in the processing 
• 
operating procedures used 
May 2023 
REGDOC-2.5.2, Design of Reactor Facilities, Version 2.1 
93 
 
• 
the requirements for periodic check measurements 
• 
the accuracy of design calculations used in developing correlations when primary variables are 
not directly measured 
• 
the uncertainty analyses for the information and processing system 
• 
the requirements for instruments, the calibration and calculations involved in their use, and the 
uncertainties involved in conversion of instrument readings into power distribution 
• 
the limits and set points for control actions, alarms, or automatic trip for instrument systems 
and demonstration that these systems can maintain the reactor within design power distribution 
limits (including the instrumentation alarms for the limits of normal operation (e.g., offset 
limits, control bank limits) and for abnormal situations (e.g., flux tilt alarms)) 
• 
measurements in previous reactors and critical experiments, including their use in the 
uncertainty analyses 
• 
measurements needed for start-up confirmatory tests and the required periodic measurements 
The limiting power distributions should be determined such that the limits on power densities and 
peaking factors can be maintained in operation. These limiting power distributions may be maintained 
(i.e., not exceeded) administratively (i.e., not by automatic shutdown), provided a suitable 
demonstration is made that sufficient, properly translated information and alarms are available for the 
reactor instrumentation to keep the operator informed. 
The design should establish the correlation between design power distributions and operating power 
distributions, including instrument-calculation correlations, operating procedures used, and 
measurements that will be taken. Necessary limits on these operations should be established. 
Design power distributions should be broken down into the following components: 
• 
power generated in the fuel 
• 
power generated directly in the coolant and moderator 
• 
power generated directly in the core internals 
The reference design core power distributions (axial, radial, and local distributions and peaking factors) 
used in AOO and accident analyses should be established. In addition, power distributions within fuel 
pins should be established. 
The design limits for power densities (and thus for peaking factors) during normal operation should be 
such that acceptable fuel design limits are not exceeded during AOOs and that other limits are not 
exceeded during DBAs and DECs. The design limits, along with related uncertainties, operating limits, 
instrument requirements, and set points, should be incorporated into OLCs. 
Reactivity coefficients 
The design should establish and characterize the bounding reference values for reactivity coefficients. 
These reference values should be conservative. 
The range of plant states to be covered should include the entire operating range – from cold shutdown 
through full power – and the extremes reached in AOOs, DBAs and DECs. It should include the full 
range of the fuelling cycle, and an appropriate range of reactivity device configurations. 
The design calculations of reactivity coefficients should cover the full applicable range of the variables 
and modelling approximations in AOO and accident analyses, including approximations related to 
modelling and nodalization of the reactor cooling system. Where applicable, the difference between 
intra- and inter-assembly moderator coefficients needs to be established. 
May 2023 
REGDOC-2.5.2, Design of Reactor Facilities, Version 2.1 
94 
 
Conservatism should be considered based on: 
• 
the use of a coefficient (i.e., the analyses in which it is important) 
• 
whether state of the art tools have been used for calculation of the coefficient 
• 
the uncertainty associated with such calculations and experimental checks of the coefficient in 
operating reactors 
• 
any required checks of the coefficient in the start-up program following significant core 
reconfiguration 
The design calculation should cover and be supported by the following: 
• 
calculated nominal values for the reactivity coefficients, such as the coolant and moderator 
coefficients (temperature, void, or density coefficients), the Doppler coefficient and power 
coefficients 
• 
uncertainty analyses for nominal values, including the magnitude of the uncertainty and the 
justification of the magnitude (by examination of the accuracy of the methods used in calculations), 
and comparison, where possible, with reactor experiments 
• 
combination of nominal values and uncertainties to provide suitably conservative values for use in 
reactor steady-state analysis (primarily control requirements), stability analyses, and the AOO and 
accident analyses 
For comparisons to experiments, it is important to show that the experiments are applicable and 
relevant, and the experimental conditions overlap the operating and anticipated accident conditions. 
It is recognized that reactivity coefficients of the design are important in determining the reactor 
behavior and safety characteristics. This document does not have specific requirements on the sign or 
magnitude of the reactivity coefficients including the power coefficient of reactivity. Instead, this 
document requires a number of design provisions related to the nuclear design to ensure that the design 
is acceptable for reactor control, stability and plant safety. If a reactor design has a positive power 
coefficient of reactivity for any operating state, the design authority should demonstrate that operation 
with a positive power coefficient is acceptable, by showing: 
• 
a bounding value of power coefficient of reactivity has been calculated for all permitted operating 
states and used in control, stability, and safety analyses 
• 
measurements of the power coefficient of reactivity are conducted at start-up and periodically for 
certain operating limiting core conditions to demonstrate that measured values are bounded by 
calculated values with adequate margin 
• 
the reactor control system is designed with adequate reliability and has the capability to 
automatically accommodate for a positive power coefficient of reactivity for a wide range of AOOs 
The design should ensure that the likelihood of exceeding specified criteria of the AOOs without 
shutdown is sufficiently small, by demonstrating either that the criteria are met, or that a diverse 
shutdown means is installed, which significantly reduces the probability of a failure to shut down. 
Criticality 
The nuclear design should ensure that the criticality of the reactor during refuelling is controlled. If on-
power refuelling is used to compensate for core reactivity depletion, the nuclear design should establish 
the values of core excess reactivity, maximum local powers, amount of fuel loaded per refuelling 
operation and frequency of refuelling load. The design should also ensure that the maximum core 
excess reactivity and predicted local power peaks will not exceed the control system capability and fuel 
thermal limits. 
May 2023 
REGDOC-2.5.2, Design of Reactor Facilities, Version 2.1 
95 
 
Core stability 
Power oscillations that could result in conditions exceeding specified acceptable fuel design limits 
should be reliably and readily detected and suppressed. 
Assessment of reactor core stability should include: 
• 
phenomena and reactor aspects that influence the stability of the nuclear reactor core 
• 
calculations and considerations given to xenon-induced spatial oscillations 
• 
potential stability issues, due to other phenomena or conditions 
• 
verification of the analytical methods for comparison with measured data 
Analytical methods 
The analytical methods and database used for nuclear design and reactor physics analyses should be 
consistent with modern best practices. Also, the experiments used to validate the analytical methods 
should be adequate representations of fuel designs in the reactor, and ranges of key parameters in the 
validation database should overlap those expected in design and safety analysis. 
The design should be such that the analytical methods used in the nuclear design (including those for 
predicting criticality, reactivity coefficients, burnup and stability), as well as the database and nuclear 
data libraries used for neutron cross-section data and other nuclear parameters (including delayed 
neutron and photo neutron data and other relevant data), are adequate and fit for application, based on 
adequate qualification. The qualification should be based on proven practices for validation and 
verification, using the acceptable codes and standards. 
A validation or verification method can be proven either by meeting accepted verification and 
validation standards, or by established practice, or some combination of these. New method(s) are 
“proven” by performing a number of acceptance and demonstration tests that show that the method(s) 
meets pre-defined criteria. 
Core internals and vessel 
The nuclear design should establish: 
• 
neutron flux spectrum above 1 million electron volts in the core, at the core boundaries, and at the 
inside vessel wall, if applicable 
• 
assumptions used in the calculations, including the power level, the use factor, the type of fuel cycle 
considered, and the design life of the vessel 
• 
computer codes used in the analysis 
• 
the database for fast neutron cross-sections 
• 
the geometric modelling of the reactor core, internals, and vessel(s) 
• 
uncertainties in the calculations

Guidance on core management and fuel handling 
The reactor design should be such that the plant will operate within the specified operating limits for the 
entire reactor lifecycle (including intermediate reactor core states). 
The design should provide for functional tests to be performed periodically for monitoring the health of 
the reactor components. 
The design should provide for the capability to monitor online important core parameters, to ensure that 
the acceptable operating limits for the reactor are not exceeded during normal operation. The types of 
detectors and other devices used in monitoring the core parameters should be described. 
The reactor control strategy should be defined, to ensure that the reactor will be restored to an 
acceptable safe state if any reactor parameter deviates from its allowed domain. The control strategy 
should be such that fuel integrity will be maintained for all AOOs. 
The refuelling scheme should be developed to ensure that the intermediate refuelling configurations do 
not have more reactivity than the most reactive configuration approved in the design. The core 
parameters for the intermediate configurations should be within their approved limits. 
The design should allow for data acquisition during reactor operation and record-keeping for later 
retrieval and analysis. 
The design should take into account the details of fuel management strategy, including the loading of 
fuel into the fresh core, and the criteria for determining the location of fuel assemblies to be unloaded 
from the reactor and loaded with fresh fuel. 
For reactor designs where a significant fraction of the fuel is replaced or shuffled during fuelling, the 
design should provide for diagnostic tests at start-up. These tests should verify that the core parameters 
are within their allowed range. 
Guidance on mechanical design of reactor internals 
The reactor internals classified as core support structures according to the ASME Boiler and Pressure 
Vessel Code (BPVC) [33], Section III, Division 1, NG-1121, Core Support Structures, should be 
designed, fabricated, and examined in accordance with the provisions of ASME BPVC Section III 
Division 1, subsection NG. 
Those reactor internals not classified as ASME BPVC Code, Section III, Division 1, Core Support 
Structures should be classified as internal structures in accordance with ASME Code, Section III, 
Division 1, Subsection NG-1122 [122]. The design criteria, loading conditions, and analyses that 
provide the basis for the design of reactor internals (other than the core support structures) should meet 
the guidelines of the ASME Code, Section III, Division 1, Subsection NG- 3000, and be constructed so 
May 2023 
REGDOC-2.5.2, Design of Reactor Facilities, Version 2.1 
97 
 
as to not adversely affect the integrity of the core support structures. If other guidelines (e.g., 
manufacturer standards or empirical methods based on field experience and testing) are the bases for 
the stress, deformation, and fatigue criteria, those guidelines should be identified and their use justified 
in the design. 
For non-ASME code structures, components and supports, design margins presented for allowable 
stress, deformation, and fatigue should be equal to or greater than margins for other plants of similar 
design with successful operating experience. Any decreases in design margins should be justified. 
Specific reactor internals of a high safety class should be designed, fabricated, and examined in 
accordance with the applicable codes and standards, such as ASME Section III for light water reactors 
(LWR), and CSA N285.0, General Requirements for Pressure-retaining Systems and Components in 
CANDU Nuclear Power Plants for CANDU. 
6.1.1 
Fuel elements, assemblies and design 
Fuel assembly design shall include all components in the assembly, such as the fuel matrix, cladding, 
spacers, support plates, movable rods inside the assembly, etc. The fuel assembly design shall also 
identify all interfacing systems. 
Fuel assemblies and the associated components shall be designed to withstand the anticipated 
irradiation and environmental conditions in the reactor core, and all processes of deterioration that can 
occur in operational states. The fuel shall remain suitable for continued use after AOOs. At the design 
stage, consideration shall be given to long-term storage of irradiated fuel assemblies after discharge 
from the reactor. 
Fuel design limits shall be established to include, at a minimum, limits on fuel power or temperature, 
limits on fuel burnup, and limits on the leakage of fission products in the reactor cooling system. The 
design limits shall reflect the importance of preserving the fuel matrix and cladding, as these are first 
and second barriers to fission product release, respectively. 
The design shall account for all known degradation mechanisms, with allowance being made for 
uncertainties in data, calculations, and fuel fabrication. 
Fuel assemblies shall be designed to permit adequate inspection of their structures and components 
prior to and following irradiation. 
In DBAs, the fuel assembly and its component parts shall remain in position with no distortion that 
would prevent effective post-accident core cooling or interfere with the actions of reactivity control 
devices or mechanisms. The design shall specify the acceptance criteria necessary to meet these 
requirements in DBAs. 
The requirements for reactor and fuel assembly design shall apply in the event of changes in fuel 
management strategy, or in operating conditions, over the lifetime of the plant. 
Fuel design and design limits shall reflect a verified and auditable knowledge base. The fuel shall be 
qualified for operation, either through experience with the same type of fuel in other reactors, or 
through a program of experimental testing and analysis, to ensure that fuel assembly requirements are 
met. 
 
 
May 2023 
REGDOC-2.5.2, Design of Reactor Facilities, Version 2.1

Guidance 
The fuel design and qualification should provide assurance that the reactor core design requirements in 
section 6.1 are met. 
Acceptance criteria should be established for fuel damage, fuel rod failure, and fuel coolability. These 
criteria should be derived from experiments that identify the limitations of the material properties of the 
fuel and fuel assembly, and related analyses. The fuel design criteria and other design considerations 
are discussed below. 
Fuel damage 
Fuel damage criteria should be established for all known damage mechanisms in operational states 
(normal operation and AOOs). The damage criteria should ensure that fuel dimensions remain within 
operational tolerances, and that functional capabilities are not reduced below those assumed in the 
safety analysis. When applicable, the fuel damage criteria should consider high burn-up effects based 
on irradiated material properties data. The criteria should include stress, strain or loading limits, the 
cumulative number of strain fatigue cycles, fretting wear, oxidation, hydriding (deuteriding in CANDU 
reactors), build-up of corrosion products, dimensional changes, rod internal gas pressures, worst-case 
hydraulic loads, and LWR control rod insertability. 
Fuel rod failure 
Fuel rod failure applies to operational states, DBAs and DECs. Fuel rod failure criteria should be 
provided for all known fuel rod failure mechanisms. The design should ensure that fuel does not fail as 
a result of specific causes during operational states. Fuel rod failures could occur during DBAs and 
DECs, and are accounted for in the safety analysis. 
Assessment methods should be stated for fuel failure mechanisms, reactor loading and power 
manoeuvring limitations, and fuel duty, leading to an acceptably low probability of failure. When 
applicable, the fuel rod failure criteria should consider high burnup effects, based on data of irradiated 
material properties. The criteria should include: 
• 
hydriding 
• 
cladding collapse 
• 
cladding overheating 
• 
fuel pellet overheating 
• 
excessive fuel enthalpy 
• 
pellet-clad interaction 
• 
stress-corrosion cracking 
• 
cladding bursting 
• 
mechanical fracturing 
Fuel coolability 
Fuel coolability applies to DBAs and, to the extent practicable, DECs. Fuel coolability criteria should 
be provided for all damage mechanisms in DBAs and DECs. The fuel should be designed to ensure that 
fuel rod damage will not interfere with effective emergency core cooling. The cladding temperatures 
should not reach a temperature high enough to allow a significant metal-water reaction to occur, thereby 
minimizing the potential for fission product release. The criteria should include cladding embrittlement, 
fuel rod ballooning, structural deformation and, in CANDU, beryllium braze penetration. 
May 2023 
REGDOC-2.5.2, Design of Reactor Facilities, Version 2.1 
99 
 
Other considerations 
The design should also include: 
• 
all expected fuel handling activities 
• 
the effects of post-irradiation fuel assembly handling 
• 
cooling flow of other components of LWR fuel assembly (such as control rods, poison rods, 
instrumentation, or neutron sources) 
Testing, inspection, and surveillance programs 
Programs for testing and inspection of new fuel, as well as for online fuel monitoring and post- 
irradiation surveillance of irradiated fuel, should be established. 
Fuel specifications 
The design should establish the specifications of fuel rods and assembly (including LWR control rods) 
in order to minimize design deviations and to determine whether all design bases are met (such as limits 
and tolerances). 
Reactor core thermal hydraulic design 
The thermal hydraulic design should be such that sufficient margin exists with regard to maintaining 
adequate heat transfer from the fuel to the reactor coolant system, to prevent fuel sheath overheating. 
The design requirements can be demonstrated by meeting a set of derived acceptance criteria, as 
required by REGDOC-2.4.1, Deterministic Safety Analysis [20]. 
Critical heat flux (CHF) is defined as the heat flux at departure from nucleate boiling (DNB), 
commonly used in pressurized water reactors (PWRs), or at dryout, commonly used in CANDU 
designs. 
It should be noted that, although a thermal margin criterion is sufficient to demonstrate that overheating 
from a deficient cooling mechanism can be avoided, other mechanistic methods may be acceptable, as 
CHF is not considered as a failure mechanism. In some designs, CHF conditions during transients can 
be tolerated if it can be shown by other methods that the sheath temperatures do not exceed well-
defined acceptable limits. However, any other criteria than the CHF criterion should address sheath 
temperature, pressure, duration, oxidation, embrittlement, etc., and these new criteria should be 
supported by sufficient experimental and analytical evidence. In the absence of such evidence, the core 
thermal hydraulic design is expected to demonstrate a thermal margin to CHF. 
The demonstration of thermal margin is expected to be presented in a manner that accounts for all 
possible reactor operational states and conditions, as determined from operating maps, including all 
AOOs. The demonstration should also include long term effects of plant aging and other expected 
changes to core configuration over the operating life of the plant. 
The demonstration of thermal margin should thoroughly address uncertainties of various parameters 
affecting the thermal margin. The design should identify all sources of significant uncertainties that 
contribute to the uncertainty of thermal margin. The uncertainty for each of the sources should be 
quantified with supportable evidence. 
In addition to the demonstration of thermal margin, the core thermal hydraulic design should also 
address possible core power and flow oscillations and thermal hydraulic instabilities. The design should 
May 2023 
REGDOC-2.5.2, Design of Reactor Facilities, Version 2.1 
100 
 
be such that power and flow oscillations that result in conditions exceeding specified acceptable fuel 
design limits are not possible or can be reliably and readily detected and suppressed.

6.1.2 
Control systems 
The design shall provide the means for determining and controlling reactivity, and levels and 
distributions of neutron flux. This shall apply to neutron flux in all regions of the core during normal 
operation (including after shutdown and during and after refuelling states), and during AOOs. 
The reactor core control system shall detect and intercept deviations from normal operation with the 
goal of preventing AOOs from escalating to accident conditions. 
Adequate means shall be provided to maintain both bulk and spatial power distributions within a 
predetermined range. 
The control system shall limit the positive reactivity insertion rate to a level required to control 
reactivity changes and power manoeuvring. 
The control system, combined with the inherent characteristics of the reactor and the selected operating 
limits and conditions, shall minimize the need for shutdown action. 
The control system and the inherent reactor characteristics shall keep all critical reactor parameters 
within the specified limits for a wide range of AOOs. 
In the design of the reactivity control devices, due account shall be taken of wear-out and of the effects 
of irradiation, such as burnup, changes in physical properties and production of gas. 
Guidance 
Reactivity control 
The reactivity control should ensure that: 
• 
the acceptable fuel design limits are not exceeded as a result of a wide range of AOOs 
• 
no single malfunction of the reactivity control function can cause a violation of the acceptable fuel 
design limits 
The nuclear design reactivity control requirements and control provisions should: 
• 
compensate for long-term reactivity changes of the core; this includes reactivity changes due to 
depletion of the fissile material in the fuel, depletion of burnable poison in some of the fuel rods 
(where applicable), and buildup of fission products and transuranic isotopes 
• 
compensate for the reactivity change caused by changing the temperature of the reactor from the  
 
-power hot condition to the cold shutdown condition 
May 2023 
REGDOC-2.5.2, Design of Reactor Facilities, Version 2.1 
101 
 
• 
compensate for the reactivity effects caused by changing the reactor power level from full power to 
zero power 
• 
assure reactivity management during the fueling cycle, and intermediate times during the fuel cycle 
• 
compensate for the effects on the power distribution and stability of the high cross-section neutron 
capture of the xenon-135 
• 
cover uncertainties associated with the control rods, including: 
• 
manufacturing tolerances 
• 
methods errors 
• 
operation other than planned 
• 
control element absorber depletion 
• 
measurement uncertainty in shutdown margin demonstration 
Reactivity devices configurations and reactivity worth 
The nuclear design should establish the following for reactivity device configurations, including (where 
applicable) control rod patterns, and reactivity worth for: 
• 
reactivity devices configurations expected throughout a fuel reload cycle, power manoeuvring, and 
load-following (where applicable), including operation of single rods, or of groups or banks of rods, 
rod withdrawal order, and insertion limits, as a function of power and core life 
• 
predicted reactivity devices’ worth and reactivity insertion rates. It should be reasonably bounded to 
values that may occur in the reactor. Note: These values are typically used in the safety analysis, 
and judgments as to the adequacy of the uncertainty allowances are made in the review of the safety 
analysis 
• 
allowable deviations from the patterns indicated above, such as for misaligned rods, stuck rods, or 
rod positions used for spatial power shaping 
• 
maximum worth of individual rods or banks as a function of position for power and lifecycle 
conditions appropriate to rod withdrawal, rod ejection (or drop) accidents and other conceivable 
failures of reactivity control components leading to positive reactivity 
insertions 
• 
maximum rates of reactivity increase associated with reactivity device withdrawals and any other 
conceivable change in the configuration of reactivity devices due to failures in the reactivity control 
system. It should also include experimental confirmation of rod worth, or other factors justifying 
the reactivity increase rates used in control rod accident analyses, as well as equipment, 
administrative procedures and alarms that may be employed to restrict potential rod worth 
• 
trip (or scram) rundown reactivity, as a function of time after trip (scram) initiation and other 
pertinent parameters, including methods for calculating the rundown reactivity 
• 
equipment, operating limits, and administrative procedures necessary to restrict potential rod worth 
or reactivity insertion rates 
6.2 
Reactor coolant system 
The design shall provide the reactor coolant system (RCS) and its associated components and auxiliary 
systems with sufficient margin to ensure that the appropriate design limits of the reactor coolant 
pressure boundary are not exceeded in operational states or DBAs. 
The design shall ensure that the operation of pressure relief devices will not lead to significant 
radioactive releases from the plant, even in DBAs. The RCS shall be fitted with isolation devices to 
limit any loss of radioactive coolant outside containment. 
The material used in the fabrication of the component parts shall be selected so as to minimize 
corrosion and activation of the material. 
May 2023 
REGDOC-2.5.2, Design of Reactor Facilities, Version 2.1 
102 
 
Operating conditions in which components of the pressure boundary could exhibit brittle behaviour 
shall be avoided. 
The design shall take into account all conditions of the boundary material in normal operation 
(including maintenance and testing), AOOs, DBAs and DECs, as well as expected end-of-life properties 
affected by aging mechanisms, the rate of deterioration, and the initial state of the components. 
The design of the moving components contained inside the reactor coolant pressure boundary, such as 
pump impellers and valve parts, shall minimize the likelihood of failure and associated consequential 
damage to other items of the reactor coolant system. This shall apply to operational states and DBAs, 
with allowance for deterioration that may occur in service. 
The design shall provide a system capable of detecting and monitoring leakage from the reactor coolant 
system. 
Guidance 
The design should have adequate provisions with regard to RCS and reactor auxiliary systems. The 
design should meet design limits for the worst conditions encountered in normal operation, AOOs and 
DBAs, including pressurized thermal shock and water hammer loads. The RCS and reactor auxiliary 
systems should meet – or contribute to meeting – the following objectives: 
• 
maintain sufficient reactor coolant inventory for core cooling both during and after all postulated 
initiating events considered in the design basis 
• 
remove heat from the core after a failure of the reactor coolant pressure boundary, in order to limit 
fuel damage 
• 
remove heat from the core in appropriate operational states, DBAs and DECs with the reactor 
coolant pressure boundary intact 
• 
transfer heat from other safety systems to the ultimate heat sink 
The design of each reactor auxiliary system should ensure that automatic action by the system cannot 
impair a safety function. 
The design authority should demonstrate the adequacy of the following: 
• 
flow rate and pressure drops across major components 
• 
major thermal hydraulic parameters, such as operating pressure and temperature ranges 
• 
valve performance (flow, pressure drop, opening and closing times, stability, water hammer) 
• 
pump performance (head, flow, 2-phase flow, seal performance) 
• 
vibration of components and pipes 
• 
control of gas accumulation (in particular, prevention of combustible gas accumulation) 
• 
maximum allowable heat-up and cool-down rates 
• 
consideration of pressurized thermal shock due to operation (including inadvertent operation) of 
auxiliary systems 
• 
flow stability, including loop-to-loop stability and void-enthalpy oscillations (CANDU) 
• 
design of instrumentation taps 
May 2023

103 
 
The following provides a few examples of design expectations of the RCS and reactor auxiliary 
systems: 
Pressurizer 
For designs that include a pressurizer, the design authority should demonstrate the adequacy of the 
following: 
• 
volume and capability to accommodate load changes, and to accommodate secondary side 
transients without the need for pressure relief for the containment to the extent practicable 
• 
capability to withstand thermal shock, particularly in spray nozzles and connections to the main 
RCS circuit 
• 
control of pressure, such as via heaters, sprays, coolers or steam bleeding 
Primary pressure relief 
The design authority should demonstrate the adequacy of the following: 
• 
flow rate in single- and 2-phase flow 
• 
consideration of corrosion of valve surfaces 
• 
provisions for ensuring that relief discharge does not lead to an unacceptable harsh environment 
inside containment 
• 
relief valve stability 
Primary reactor coolant pumps 
For designs that use forced primary flow, the design authority should demonstrate the adequacy of the 
following: 
• 
primary pump performance characteristics, including head and flow characteristics, flow coast-
down rate, single- and 2-phase pump performance 
• 
pump operating parameters (e.g., speed, flow, head) 
• 
pump net positive suction head needed to avoid cavitation 
• 
pump seal design and performance (including seal temperature limitations, if applicable) 
• 
vibration monitoring provisions

In-service pressure boundary inspection 
The components of the reactor coolant pressure boundary shall be designed, manufactured, and 
arranged in a manner that permits adequate inspections and tests of the boundary, support structures and 
components throughout the lifetime of the plant. 
The design shall also facilitate surveillance in order to determine the metallurgical conditions of 
materials for which metallurgical changes are anticipated.

6.2.2 
Reactor coolant system inventory 
Taking volumetric changes and leakage into account, the design shall provide control of coolant 
inventory and pressure so as to ensure that specified design limits are not exceeded in operational states. 
This requirement shall extend to the provision of adequate capacity (flow rate and storage volumes) in 
the systems performing this function. 
The inventory in the RCS and its associated systems shall be sufficient to support cool down from hot 
operating conditions to zero-power cold conditions without the need for transfer from any other 
systems. 
If necessary for operational states and DBAs, the design shall provide means of monitoring reactor core 
coolant inventory. 
Means of estimating the core coolant inventory in DECs shall be provided, to the extent practicable. 
Guidance 
The design should take into account the provision of adequate capacity, volumetric changes, leakage, 
flow rate and storage volumes in the systems performing this function. 
6.2.3 
Reactor coolant system cleanup 
The design shall provide for adequate monitoring and removal of impurities and radioactive substances 
from the reactor coolant, including activated corrosion products and fission products leaking from the 
fuel. The safety limit for activity in the reactor coolant shall be defined. 
6.2.4 
Removal of residual heat from reactor core 
The design shall provide a means (i.e., backup) of removing residual heat from the reactor for all 
conditions of the RCS. The backup shall be independent of the configuration in use. 
The means of removing residual heat shall meet reliability requirements on the assumptions of a single 
failure and the loss of offsite power, by incorporating suitable redundancy, diversity, and independence. 
Interconnections and isolation capabilities shall have a degree of reliability that is commensurate with 
system design requirements. 
Heat removal shall be at a rate that prevents the specified design limits of the fuel and the reactor 
coolant pressure boundary from being exceeded. 
If a residual heat removal system is required when the RCS is hot and pressurized, the design shall 
ensure that it can be initiated at the normal operating conditions of the RCS. 
6.3 
Steam supply system 
6.3.1 
Steam lines 
The steam piping up to and including the turbine generator governor valves and, where applicable, the 
steam generators shall allow sufficient margin to ensure that the appropriate design limits of the 
pressure boundary are not exceeded in operational states and DBAs. This provision shall take into 
account the operation of control and safety systems.

The main steam isolation valves (MSIVs) shall be installed in each of the steam lines leading to the 
turbine, and located as close as practicable to the containment structure. 
Where MSIVs are credited with preventing steam flow into containment, they shall be capable of 
closing under the conditions for which they are credited. 
Where MSIVs provide a containment barrier, they shall meet the containment requirements that apply 
to those conditions for which they are credited. 
The MSIVs shall be inspectable and testable. 
Steam lines up to and including the first isolation valve and, where applicable, steam generators shall be 
qualified to withstand a DBE. 
6.3.2 
Stream and feedwater system piping and vessels 
All piping and vessels shall be typically separated from electrical and control systems, to the extent 
practicable. 
The auxiliary feedwater, steam generator pressure control, and other auxiliary systems shall prevent the 
escalation of AOOs to DBAs or DECs. 
6.3.3 
Turbine generators 
The design shall provide over-speed protection systems for the turbine generators to minimize the 
probability of turbine disk failure leading to generation of missiles. 
The design shall be such as to minimize the potential for any missiles from a turbine break-up striking 
the containment, or striking other SSCs important to safety. 
Guidance 
The design of turbine generators should meet the following expectations: 
• 
a turbine control and over-speed protection system should control turbine action under all normal or 
abnormal operating conditions, and should ensure that a full load turbine trip will not cause the 
turbine to over-speed beyond acceptable limits 
• 
the over-speed protection system should meet the single-failure criterion, and should be testable 
when the turbine is in operation 
• 
the turbine main steam stop and control valves and the reheat steam stop and intercept valves 
should protect the turbine from exceeding set speeds, and should protect the reactor system from 
abnormal surges 
• 
the turbine generator set should have the capability to permit periodic testing of components 
important to safety while the unit is operating at rated load 
• 
an in-service inspection and testing program for main steam and reheat valves should be established 
• 
the arrangement of connection joints between the low-pressure turbine exhaust and the main 
condenser should prevent adverse effects on any safety-related equipment in the turbine room in the 
event of a rupture (it is preferable not to locate safety-related equipment in the turbine room) 
• 
the design should consider the potential impacts of any missiles that may result from a turbine 
break-up striking the SSCs important to safety; the selection of the axes orientation of the turbine 
generator should minimize such potential

6.4 
Means of shutdown 
The design shall provide means of reactor shutdown capable of reducing reactor power to a low value, 
and maintaining that power for the required duration, when the reactor power control system and the 
inherent characteristics are insufficient or incapable of maintaining reactor power within the 
requirements of the OLCs. 
The design shall include 2 separate, independent, and diverse means of shutting down the reactor. 
At least 1 means of shutdown shall be independently capable of quickly rendering the nuclear reactor 
subcritical from normal operation in AOOs and DBAs, by an adequate margin, on the assumption of a 
single failure. For this means of shutdown, a transient recriticality may be permitted in exceptional 
circumstances if the specified fuel and component limits are not exceeded. 
At least 1 means of shutdown shall be independently capable of rendering the reactor subcritical from 
normal operation, in AOOs and DBAs, and maintaining the reactor subcritical by an adequate margin 
and with high reliability, for even the most reactive conditions of the core. 
Means shall be provided to ensure that there is a capability to shut down the reactor in DECs, and to 
maintain the reactor subcritical even for the most limiting conditions of the reactor core, including 
severe degradation of the reactor core. 
Redundancy shall be provided in the fast-acting means of shutdown if, in the event that the credited 
means of reactivity control fails during any AOO or DBA, inherent core characteristics are unable to 
maintain the reactor within specified limits. 
While resetting the means of shutdown, the maximum amount of positive reactivity and the maximum 
rate of reactivity increase shall be within the capacity of the reactor control system. 
To improve reliability, stored energy shall be used in shutdown actuation. 
The effectiveness of the means of shutdown (i.e., speed of action and shutdown margin) shall be such 
that specified limits are not exceeded, and the possibility of recriticality or reactivity excursion 
following a PIE is minimized. 
Guidance 
For the 2 means of shutting down the reactor to be independent of each other, they do not share 
components. If both means act inside the core and complete separation is not possible, adequate 
separation of ex-core components should be demonstrated. 
The design uses diverse methods for all aspects of the shutdown means, such as: 
• 
The insertion of solid control rods and injection of a solution of neutron absorbing material are the 
diverse methods normally used in water-cooled reactors. 
May 2023 
REGDOC-2.5.2, Design of Reactor Facilities, Version 2.1 
107 
 
• 
Diverse methods should be considered in the design of sensors, logic and actuation of the shutdown 
means. 
As stated in this regulatory document, “redundancy shall be provided in the fast-acting means of 
shutdown” unless the safety analysis demonstrates that, for any AOO or DBA coincident with failure of 
a single fast-acting means of shutdown, the acceptance criteria can be met. In that case, only 1 fast-
acting means of shutdown would be required. 
For shutdown means based on injection of a neutron absorbing solution, chemistry-related issues (such 
as avoiding precipitation) should be addressed. 
The design authority should specify the requirements for inspection, test and maintenance, including 
commissioning tests to verify the speed and depth of shutdown for each shutdown means. 
For LWR designs, fuel rod bowing can lead to loads on control rod guide tubes that may impair a rod-
based shutdown means. The fuel design should ensure that this does not occur in operational states and 
DBAs. 
The most reactive conditions of the core required for the analysis normally include a core with 
maximum allowable excess reactivity (for example, following batch refuelling) and the most reactive 
conditions for coolant and moderator temperature and density (for example, at cold shutdown 
conditions for a reactor with a negative temperature coefficient of reactivity). 
For CANDU reactors, there is a possibility of an in-core loss of coolant accident (LOCA). This poses a 
special challenge to reactivity control systems. In particular, hydraulic loads from an in-core LOCA can 
damage shutoff rod guides, and possibly damage poison injection nozzles. If shutdown action is 
required for an in-core LOCA, the design specification should identify how many reactivity devices 
may be damaged by the in-core LOCA. This should be consistent with the assumptions in the safety 
analysis. The results of the analysis of the extent of the damage and supporting experiments should be 
provided. 
The performance criteria for the speed and depth of a fast-acting shutdown means should be provided 
by the design authority. A shutdown means is considered to be effective if the safety analysis 
acceptance criteria are met. The performance criteria for an adequate subcriticality margin of a 
shutdown means should be provided by the design authority. 
For LWRs, in particular pressurized water reactors (PWRs), a large LOCA can lead to significant 
hydraulic loads on core internals, such as control rod guides in the upper plenum. Core barrel distortion 
could lead to misalignments. If control rod insertion is credited in the safety analysis for a large LOCA 
(most PWRs do not credit rod movement), the design should demonstrate that control rod insertion will 
not be impeded. 
6.4.1 
Reactor trip parameters 
The design authority shall specify derived acceptance criteria for reactor trip parameter effectiveness 
for all AOOs and DBAs, and shall perform a safety analysis to demonstrate the effectiveness of the 
means of shutdown. 
For each credited means of shutdown, the design shall specify a direct trip parameter to initiate reactor 
shutdown for all AOOs and DBAs in time to meet the respective derived acceptance criteria. Where a 
direct trip parameter does not exist for a given credited means, there shall be 2 diverse trip parameters 
specified for that means. 
May 2023 
REGDOC-2.5.2, Design of Reactor Facilities, Version 2.1 
108 
 
For all AOOs and DBAs, there shall be at least 2 diverse trip parameters unless it can be shown that 
failure to trip will not lead to unacceptable consequences. 
There shall be no gap in trip coverage within the OLCs for any operating condition (such as power, 
temperature), taking into account plant aging. This shall be ensured by the provision of additional trip 
parameters if necessary. A different level of effectiveness may be acceptable for the additional trip 
parameters. 
The extent of trip coverage provided by all available parameters shall be documented for the entire 
spectrum of failures for each set of PIEs. 
An assessment of the accuracy and the potential failure modes of the trip parameters shall be provided 
in the design documentation. 
Guidance 
The effectiveness of trip parameters should be assessed through safety analysis performed in 
accordance with REGDOC-2.4.1, Deterministic Safety Analysis [20]. 
Trip coverage should be demonstrated across the full range of operating states, for all credited 
shutdown means and all credited trip parameters. Note that the number of credited shutdown means and 
the number of credited trip parameters can vary with the event, the reactor design, and whether there is 
a direct trip available. 
Defining derived acceptance criteria appropriate to a particular design is the responsibility of the design 
authority. CNSC REGDOC-2.4.1, Deterministic Safety Analysis [20], provides the requirements. 
Derived acceptance criteria should be defined separately for AOOs and DBAs. The derived acceptance 
criteria should be set to give an appropriate level of confidence that a fundamental safety function is 
assured, or that a barrier to fission product release will not fail. The derived acceptance criteria should: 
• 
be quantifiable and well understood 
• 
account for the fact that the safety analysis is stylized, and the plant condition at the time 
of the 
accident may be significantly different from the analyzed state 
• 
cover uncertainties in analysis, input plant and analysis parameters, as well as code validation 
Direct trips are the preferred means of actuating a shutdown means, due to their robustness and low 
dependence on calculational models. 
Diverse trip parameters measure different physical variables on the reactor, thus providing additional 
protection against common mode failure. Where it is impracticable to provide full diversity of trip 
parameters, different measurement locations, different instrument types and different processing 
computers should be provided. Manual trip is considered an acceptable trip parameter, if the operator 
has adequate time to initiate the shutdown action following unambiguous indication of the need to 
perform the action (in accordance with section 6.10.5). 
It is the responsibility of the design authority to identify and justify those trip parameters that can be 
considered “direct.” The design authority should also demonstrate that any trip parameters that are a 
measure of the event, but not a measure of the challenge to acceptance criteria, cannot be “masked” or 
“blinded” by control system action or other means. 
Trips that are dependent on a number of measured variables, such as low DNBR (departure from 
nucleate boiling ratio) trips in PWRs, can only be considered direct if all the variables are direct. 
May 2023 
REGDOC-2.5.2, Design of Reactor Facilities, Version 2.1 
109 
 
Guidance on applying the requirements for number and diversity of trip parameters, as well as 
minimum expectation for the number of trip parameters is provided in REGDOC-2.4.1, Deterministic 
Safety Analysis [20]. 
A manual reactor trip can be considered equivalent to a trip parameter, if the requirements for crediting 
operator action from the main control room are met (see section 6.10.5) and the reliability of manual 
shutdown meets the reliability requirements for an automatic trip. 
6.4.2 
Reliability 
The design shall permit ongoing demonstration that each means of shutdown is being operated and 
maintained in a manner that ensures continued adherence to reliability and effectiveness requirements. 
Periodic testing of the systems and their components shall be scheduled at a frequency commensurate 
with applicable requirements. 
Guidance 
The reliability calculation should include sensing the need for shutdown, initiation of shutdown, and 
insertion of negative reactivity. All elements necessary to complete the shutdown function should be 
included. 
The reliability of the shutdown function should be such that the cumulative frequency of failure to shut 
down on demand is less than 10-5 failures per demand, and the contribution of all sequences involving 
failure to shut down to the large release frequency of the safety goals is less than 10-7/yr. This considers 
the likelihood of the initiating event and recognizes that the 2 shutdown means may not be completely 
independent. 
Section 6.5 requires that the shutdown function be delivered even in the presence of any single failure 
and even during the worst configuration from testing and maintenance. For example, for a rod based 
system to meet the SFC, the safety analysis may assume that the 2 highest worth control rods are 
unavailable (1 for testing, and 1 assumed to fail on demand, in accordance with the SFC). In this case, 
no further testing of rods would be allowed until the rod under testing becomes available. 
6.4.3 
Monitoring and operator action 
Once automatic shutdown is initiated, it shall be impossible for an operator to prevent its actuation. 
The need for manual shutdown actuation shall be minimized. 
The means for manual actuation and for monitoring shutdown status shall be provided in the main 
control room and secondary control room. 
6.5 
Emergency core cooling system 
Nuclear reactor facilities shall be equipped with an emergency core cooling system (ECCS). The 
function of this safety system is to transfer heat from the reactor core following a loss of reactor coolant 
that exceeds makeup capability. All equipment required for correct operation of the ECCS shall be 
considered part of the system or its safety support system(s). 
Systems that supply electrical power or cooling water to equipment used in the operation of the ECCS 
shall be classified as safety support systems, and shall be subject to all relevant requirements and 
expectations. 
May 2023 
REGDOC-2.5.2, Design of Reactor Facilities, Version 2.1 
110 
 
The design shall take into account the effect on core reactivity of the mixing of ECCS water with 
reactor coolant water, including possible mixing due to in-leakage. 
The ECCS shall meet the following criteria for all DBAs involving loss of coolant: 
1. All fuel assemblies and components in the reactor shall be kept in a configuration such that 
continued removal of the residual heat produced by the fuel can be maintained. 
2. A continued cooling flow (recovery flow) shall be supplied to prevent further damage to the fuel 
after adequate cooling of the fuel is re-established by the ECCS. 
The ECCS recovery flow path shall be such that impediment to the recovery of coolant following a loss 
of coolant accident by debris or other material is avoided. 
The design shall ensure that maintenance and reliability testing can be carried out without a reduction in 
the effectiveness of the system below the OLCs, if the testing is conducted when ECCS availability is 
required. 
In the event of an accident when injection of emergency coolant is required, it shall not be readily 
possible for an operator to prevent the injection from taking place. 
All ECCS components that may contain radioactive material shall be located inside containment or in 
an extension of containment. 
ECCS piping in an extension of containment that may contain radioactivity from the reactor core shall 
be subject to the following requirements: 
1. As a piping extension to containment, it meets the requirements for metal penetrations of 
containment. 
2. All piping and components of the ECCS recovery flow path piping that are open to the containment 
atmosphere are designed for a pressure greater than the containment design pressure. 
3. All ECCS recovery flow paths are housed in a confinement structure that prevents leakage of 
radioactivity to the environment and to adjacent structures. 
4. This housing includes detection capability for leakage of radioactivity, and the capability to either 
return the radioactivity to the flow path, or to collect the radioactivity and store or process it in a 
system designed for this purpose. 
Intermediate or secondary cooling piping loops shall have leak detection, whether the ECCS recovery 
system is inside or outside of containment, with the leak detection being such that upon detection of 
radioactivity from the ECCS recovery flow, the loops can be isolated as per the requirements for 
containment isolation. 
Inadvertent operation of all or part of the ECCS shall have no detrimental effect on plant safety. 
Guidance 
The design authority should describe any reactivity control function performed by the ECCS, together 
with necessary limits and conditions. For example, PWRs often credit soluble boron in the ECCS 
accumulators and storage tanks, to supplement control rod insertion for long term reactivity control. 
ECCS designs should be proven by appropriate experimental programs and computer modelling. It 
should be demonstrated that there is adequate experimental evidence of ECCS effectiveness. 
May 2023 
REGDOC-2.5.2, Design of Reactor Facilities, Version 2.1 
111 
 
Examples of items that could be important in the ECCS design include: 
• 
mechanisms for core bypassing (e.g., downcomer bypass during blowdown in PWRs, or core bypass 
via steam generators in CANDU) 
• 
effects of non-condensable gas on ECCS performance 
• 
phenomena that can impede core refill and rewet (such as periods of stagnation, steam binding in 
PWR steam generators, parallel channel effects in CANDU) 
• 
effect of multi-dimensional flow in heat transport system headers in CANDU 
• 
effect of non-uniform channel flow resistance in the CANDU core (e.g., peripheral low-flow and 
low-power channels having much higher flow resistance for ECCS refill) 
• 
effect of the pressurizer 
Section 6.5 requires that the ECCS be capable of removing residual heat over an extended period. This 
normally involves recovering water spilled from the break, cooling it and returning it to the reactor. It 
should be demonstrated that: 
• 
the design is capable of recirculating coolant even in the presence of the maximum quantity of debris 
that may be present after a LOCA 
• 
possible chemical effects in the reactor building recovery sump have been considered, and any 
chemical precipitates and other species (such as gels, colloids, etc.) cannot significantly impair 
ECCS recovery flow (for example, at strainers or the heat exchangers) 
• 
recovery actions (such as transfer to hot leg injection of ECCS, or transfer to the normal residual 
heat removal system) are described and shown to be achievable; long-term removal of heat by 
boiling in the core could potentially lead to deposition or fouling (for example, precipitation of boric 
acid crystals) impairing flow and heat transfer 
• 
wear on bearings and seals has been considered, including abrasion by small particles and chemical 
corrosion 
• 
natural circulation flows, where credited, are capable of providing sufficient flows and cannot be 
impaired by such effects as accumulation of non-condensable gas or adverse temperature 
distributions 
Sections 5.14 and 5.16 describe the inspection, test and maintenance requirements, which should 
include: 
• 
commissioning tests to verify flow, pressure drop and (if applicable) tank isolation after injection for 
accumulators and other makeup tanks 
• 
commissioning tests to verify pump head, flow and system pressure drop for pumped injection 
As stated in this regulatory document, “in the event of an accident when injection of emergency coolant 
is required, it shall not be readily possible for an operator to prevent the injection from taking place.” 
This can be achieved by a variety of methods to ensure that the blocking action is intentional (such as 
requiring multiple actions, sequential actions, actions that are spatially separated, or actions that have to 
be performed by different people). 
Emergency operating procedures should prohibit blocking of ECCS injection, unless there is clear and 
unambiguous indication that it is not needed (for example, if there is clear indication that there is 
adequate inventory to ensure core cooling, and that the inventory is not decreasing). 
Injection of a large volume of cold water may cause pressurized thermal shock to the reactor coolant 
pressure boundary, or distortion of reactor internals. The design authority should demonstrate that 
thermal shock has been adequately addressed in the design, in terms of calculating transient fluid 
conditions at key locations, as well as resulting metal temperature and the corresponding stresses. 
May 2023 
REGDOC-2.5.2, Design of Reactor Facilities, Version 2.1 
112 
 
Water hammer loads may be generated by operation of valves, or by condensation when cold water is 
injected into steam filled systems. The design authority should demonstrate that a water hammer 
assessment has been performed. 
6.6 
Containment and means of confinement 
6.6.1 
Containment 
Each nuclear reactor facility shall be installed within a containment structure, so as to minimize the 
release of radioactive materials to the environment during operational states and DBAs. 
Containment shall also assist in mitigating the consequences of DECs. In particular, the containment 
and its safety features shall be able to perform their credited functions during DBAs and DECs, 
including melting of the reactor core. To the extent practicable, these functions shall be available for 
events more severe than DECs. 
The containment shall be a safety system and may include complementary design features. Both the 
containment system and the complementary design features shall be subject to the respective design 
requirements provided in this regulatory document. 
The design shall include a clearly defined continuous leak-tight containment envelope, the boundaries 
of which are defined for all conditions that could exist in the operation or maintenance of the reactor, or 
following an accident. 
All piping that is part of the main or backup reactor coolant systems shall be entirely within the main 
containment structure, or in an extension to the containment structure. 
The containment design shall incorporate systems in order to assist in controlling internal pressure and 
the release of radioactive material to the environment, following an accident. 
The containment shall include at least the following subsystems: 
1. the containment structure and related components 
2. equipment required to isolate the containment envelope and maintain its completeness and 
continuity following an accident 
3. equipment required to reduce the pressure and temperature of the containment and reduce the 
concentration of free radioactive material within the containment envelope 
4. equipment required for limiting the release of radioactive material from the containment envelope 
following an accident 
When the containment design includes the use of compressed air or non-condensable gas systems in 
response to a DBA, the autonomy of the compressed air system shall be demonstrated. 
In the event of a loss of compressed air, containment isolation valves shall fail in their safe state. 
The design authority shall identify where and when the containment boundary is credited for providing 
shielding for people and equipment. 
 
 
 
May 2023 
REGDOC-2.5.2, Design of Reactor Facilities, Version 2.1 
113 
 
Guidance 
The design should establish acceptance criteria for inspection, testing and maintenance provisions, 
including, as applicable: 
• 
containment penetration isolation times 
• 
containment spray performance 
• 
filtered venting capability 
• 
vacuum building actuation 
• 
hydrogen mitigation system capability (e.g., recombiners) 
• 
systems and equipment used for containment heat removal 
• 
concrete condition and possible concrete degradation 
The effects of release of compressed air inside the containment after isolation (for example, leakage 
from air-operated valves) should be considered in calculating containment pressure loads.

Nuclear Power Plants [82]

plants and Requirements for the containment system of nuclear power plants [83] 
6.6.2 
Strength of the containment structure 
The strength of the containment structure shall provide sufficient margins of safety based on potential 
internal overpressures, underpressures, temperatures, dynamic effects such as missile generation, and 
reaction-forces anticipated to result in the event of DBAs. Strength margins shall be applied to access 
openings, penetrations, and isolation valves, and to the containment heat removal system. 
The margins shall reflect: 
1. effects of other potential energy sources, such as possible chemical reactions and radiolytic 
reactions 
2. limited experience and experimental data available for defining accident phenomena and 
containment responses 
3. conservatism of the calculation model and input parameters 
The positive and negative design pressures within each part of the containment boundary shall include 
the highest and lowest pressures that could be generated in the respective parts as a result of any DBA. 
The containment structure shall protect systems and equipment important to safety in order to preserve 
the safety functions of the plant. 
The design shall support the maintenance of full functionality following a DBE for all the parts of the 
containment system credited in the safety analysis. 
The seismic design of the concrete containment structure shall have an elastic response when subjected 
to seismic ground motions. The special detailing of reinforcement shall allow the structure to possess 
ductility and energy-absorbing capacity, which permits inelastic deformation without failure. 
May 2023 
REGDOC-2.5.2, Design of Reactor Facilities, Version 2.1 
114 
 
Guidance 
Section 6.6.12 indicates that, in addition to the specific requirements for DBAs, consideration is given 
to severe accidents, so as to provide reasonable confidence that the containment will perform as 
credited in DEC analysis. 
For additional guidance on the design of containment structures, refer to section 5.15. 
6.6.3 
Capability for pressure tests 
The containment structure shall be subject to pressure testing at a specified pressure in order to 
demonstrate structural integrity. Testing shall be conducted before plant operation commences and at 
appropriate intervals throughout the plant’s lifetime. 
6.6.4 
Leakage 
Leakage rate limits 
The safety leakage rate limit shall ensure that: 
1. normal operation release limits are met 
2. AOOs and DBAs will not result in exceeding dose acceptance criteria 
 The design leakage rate limit shall be: 
1. below the safety leakage rate limit 
2. as low as is practicably attainable 
3. consistent with state-of-the-art design practices 
Test acceptance leakage rate limits 
A test acceptance leakage rate shall provide the maximum rate acceptable under actual measurement 
tests. Test acceptance leakage rate limits shall be established for the entire containment system, and for 
individual components that can contribute significantly to leakage. 
The containment structure and the equipment and components affecting the leak tightness of the 
containment system shall be designed to allow leak rate testing: 
1. for commissioning, at the containment design pressure 
2. over the service lifetime of the reactor, in accordance with applicable codes and standards 
The design shall provide ready and reliable detection of any significant breach of the containment 
envelope. 
Guidance 
A modern containment should be able to achieve a leakage rate of less than 0.5% containment air mass 
per day at the maximum containment pressure from any DBA. For example, modern designs achieve a 
maximum leakage rate of 0.1% to 0.5% containment air mass per day at design pressure. 
The safety leakage rate limit is the maximum leakage rate that will allow the dose acceptance criteria to 
be met for any AOO or DBA; the containment should be designed with a much lower leakage. Testing 
for compliance throughout the reactor life ensures that the design leakage rate is not exceeded.

containment structures for nuclear power plants [83] 
6.6.5 
Containment penetrations 
The number of penetrations through the containment shall be kept to a minimum. 
All containment penetrations shall be subject to the same design requirements as the containment 
structure itself, and shall be protected from reaction forces stemming from pipe movement or accidental 
loads, such as those due to missiles generated by external or internal events, jet impact, and pipe whip. 
All penetrations shall be designed to allow for periodic inspection and testing. 
If resilient seals such as elastomeric seals, electrical cable penetrations, or expansion bellows are used 
with penetrations, they shall have the capacity for leak testing at the containment design pressure. To 
demonstrate continued integrity over the lifetime of the plant, this capacity shall support testing that is 
independent of determining the leak rate of the containment as a whole. 
Guidance 
Keeping the number of penetrations through the containment to a minimum should consider the need 
for separation and redundancy, and be consistent with modern designs. 
6.6.6 
Containment isolation 
Each line of the reactor coolant pressure boundary that penetrates the containment, or that is connected 
directly to the containment atmosphere, shall be automatically and reliably sealed. This requirement is 
essential to maintaining the leak tightness of the containment in the event of an accident, and preventing 
radioactive releases to the environment that exceed prescribed limits. 
Automatic isolation valves shall be positioned to provide the greatest safety upon loss of actuating 
power. 
Piping systems that penetrate the containment system shall have isolation devices with redundancy, 
reliability, and performance capabilities that reflect the importance of isolating the various types of 
piping systems. Alternative types of isolation may be used where justification is provided. 
Where manual isolation valves are used, they shall be readily accessible and have locking or continuous 
monitoring capability. 
Reactor coolant system auxiliaries that penetrate containment 
Each auxiliary line that is connected to the reactor coolant pressure boundary, and that penetrates the 
containment structure, shall include 2 isolation valves in series. The valves shall be normally arranged 
with 1 inside and 1 outside the containment structure. 
May 2023 
REGDOC-2.5.2, Design of Reactor Facilities, Version 2.1 
116 
 
Where the valves provide isolation of the heat transport system during normal operation, both valves 
shall be normally in the closed position. 
Systems directly connected to the reactor coolant system that may be open during normal operation 
shall be subject to the same isolation requirements as the normally closed system, with the exception 
that manual isolating valves inside the containment structure will not be used. At least 1 of the 2 
isolation valves shall be either automatic or powered, and operable from the main and secondary control 
rooms. 
For any piping outside of containment that could contain radioactivity from the reactor core, the 
following requirements shall apply: 
1. The design parameters shall be the same as those for a piping extension to containment, and are 
subject to the requirements for metal penetrations of containment. 
2. All piping and components that are open to the containment atmosphere shall be designed for a 
pressure greater than the containment design pressure. 
3. The piping and components shall be housed in a confinement structure that prevents leakage of 
radioactivity to the environment and to adjacent structures. 
4. This housing shall include detection capability for leakage of radioactivity, and the capability to 
deal safely with the leakage. 
Systems connected to containment atmosphere 
Each line that connects directly to the containment atmosphere, that penetrates the containment 
structure and that is not part of a closed system shall be provided with 2 isolation barriers that meet the 
following requirements: 
1. 2 automatic isolation valves in series for lines that may be open to the containment atmosphere 
2. 2 closed isolation valves in series for lines that are normally closed to the containment atmosphere 
3. the line up to and including the second valve is part of the containment envelope 
Closed systems 
All closed piping service systems shall have at least 1 single isolation valve on each line penetrating the 
containment, with the valve being located outside of, but as close as practicable to, the containment 
structure. 
Where failure of a closed loop is assumed to be a PIE or the result of a PIE, the isolations appropriate to 
the system shall apply. 
Closed piping service systems, whether inside or outside the containment structure, that form part of the 
containment envelope, require no further isolation if: 
1. they meet the applicable service piping standards and codes 
2. they can be continuously monitored for leaks 
6.6.7 
Containment airlocks 
Personnel access to the containment shall take place through airlocks equipped with doors that are 
interlocked to ensure that at least 1 of the doors is closed during operational states, DBAs and DECs. 
May 2023 
REGDOC-2.5.2, Design of Reactor Facilities, Version 2.1 
117 
 
Where provision is made for entry of personnel for surveillance or maintenance purposes during normal 
operation, the design shall specify provisions for personnel safety, including emergency egress. This 
requirement shall also apply to equipment air locks. 
Guidance 
Containment openings for the movement of equipment or material through the containment should be 
designed to be closed quickly and reliably, in the event that isolation of the containment is required. 
The need for personnel access to the containment should be minimized. Following an accident, access 
to the containment for the purpose of ensuring the safety of the facility (either short or long term) 
should not be necessary. 
6.6.8 
Internal structures of the containment 
The design shall provide for ample flow routes between separate compartments inside the containment. 
The openings between compartments shall be large enough to prevent significant pressure differentials, 
which may cause damage to load-bearing and safety systems during AOOs, DBAs and DECs. 
The design of internal structures shall consider the hydrogen control strategy, and assist in the 
effectiveness of that strategy. 
Guidance 
Acceptable methods should be used to calculate pressure differentials and demonstrate that there will be 
no loss of safety function to load-bearing structures and safety systems during AOOs, DBAs and DECs 
(including consideration of hydrogen). In particular, the analyses of a large LOCA, main steamline 
break and DBE are expected to lead to challenging conditions. Analysis assumptions should ensure that 
they are conservative with respect to containment pressure, compartment differential pressure and 
hydrogen distribution, as well as the safety functions of SSCs. 
Sufficient openings should be provided between compartments, so as to preclude potential hydrogen 
accumulation at dead ends. If appropriate, phenomena such as flame acceleration and standing flames 
should be taken into account. 
The internal structures should provide adequate return flow paths for coolant (e.g., from a postulated 
pipe break to the containment sump) if credited in the safety analysis. The possibility of obstruction of 
the flow paths by debris should be considered. 
For additional guidance on the design of internal structures, refer to section 5.15.

6.6.9 
Containment pressure and energy management 
The design shall enable heat removal and pressure reduction in the reactor containment in operational 
states, DBAs and DECs. Systems designed for this purpose shall be treated as part of the containment 
system, and are capable of: 
1. minimizing the pressure-assisted release of fission products to the environment 
2. preserving containment integrity 
3. preserving required leak tightness 
Guidance 
The means of providing systems to remove heat and reduce pressure in the containment can vary widely 
between designs and may employ systems such as: 
• 
pressure suppression pools, ice condensers, vacuum chambers 
• 
containment coolers and fans 
• 
sump or in-containment water cooling systems used as part of a LOCA recirculation 
• 
passive containment cooling 
• 
containment spray or dousing systems 
• 
free volume inside the reactor building 
• 
containment venting through filters or scrubbers 
Pressure and energy management equipment credited in DBAs is treated as part of the containment 
system. For example, if credited, fan motors should be designed for operation in post-accident 
combustible gas conditions. 
For DECs, all heat sources should be considered, including combustion of gases, metal-water reactions 
and the formation of solid solutions (including eutectics). The design should ensure that the heat 
removal capacity is consistent with analysis of containment conditions. 
Air systems (such as instrument air and breathing air) should be reliably isolated after a postulated 
initiating event that requires containment isolation, in order to prevent containment over-pressurization 
and to reduce combustion and explosion effects. 
6.6.10 Control and cleanup of the containment atmosphere 
The design shall provide systems to control the release of fission products, hydrogen, oxygen, and other 
substances into the reactor containment, as necessary, to: 
1. reduce the amount of fission products that might be released to the environment during an accident 
2. prevent deflagration or detonation that could jeopardize the integrity or leak tightness of the 
containment 
The design shall also: 
1. provide isolation of all sources of compressed air and other non-condensable gases into the 
containment atmosphere following an accident 
2. ensure that, in the case of ingress of non-condensable gas resulting from a PIE, containment 
pressure will not exceed the design limit 
3. provide isolation of compressed air sources to prevent any bypass of containment 
May 2023 
REGDOC-2.5.2, Design of Reactor Facilities, Version 2.1 
119 
 
6.6.11 Coverings, coatings and materials 
The coverings and coatings for components and structures within the containment shall be carefully 
selected, and their methods of application shall be specified to ensure fulfillment of their safety 
functions. The primary objective of this requirement is to minimize interference with other safety 
functions or accident mitigation systems in the event of deterioration of coverings and coatings. In 
addition, the choice of materials inside containment shall take into account the impact on post-accident 
containment conditions, including fission product behaviour, acidity, equipment fouling, radiolysis, 
fires, and other factors that may affect containment performance and integrity, and fission product 
release. 
Coverings and coatings shall also be selected considering the need for their removal and replacement to 
permit access to components for maintenance and inspection. 
Guidance 
The design authority should demonstrate that there is confidence that interference with safety functions 
and other safety systems by coverings, coatings, and materials is minimized. Examples include: 
• 
insulation materials, corrosion products, delaminated paints and coatings that may foul ECC 
recovery flow paths or prevent operation of equipment 
• 
use of rubberized sealing materials that could melt or otherwise fail, and lead either to additional 
containment leakage or failure of a safety-related component or system 
• 
materials that may react under post-accident conditions to generate combustible, corrosive or 
poisonous gases 
Where large structures in containment are credited as heat sinks in computing post-accident pressure 
and temperature in containment, calculations should use consistent information about coating materials 
and their thermal properties. 
6.6.12 Design extension conditions 
Following onset of core damage, the containment boundary shall be capable of contributing to the 
reduction of radioactivity releases to allow sufficient time for the implementation of offsite emergency 
procedures. 
Damage to the containment structure shall be limited to prevent uncontrolled releases of radioactivity, 
and to maintain the integrity of structures that support internal components. 
The ability of the containment system to withstand loads associated with design extension conditions 
(DECs) shall be demonstrated in design documentation, and shall include the following considerations: 
1. various heat sources, including residual heat, metal-water reactions, combustion of gases, and 
standing flames 
2. pressure control 
3. control of combustible gases 
4. sources of non-condensable gases 
5. control of radioactive material leakage 
6. effectiveness of isolation devices 
7. functionality and leak tightness of airlocks and containment penetrations 
8. effects of the accident on the integrity and functionality of internal structures 
May 2023 
REGDOC-2.5.2, Design of Reactor Facilities, Version 2.1 
120 
 
The design authority shall demonstrate that complementary design features have been incorporated that 
will: 
1. prevent a containment melt-through or failure due to the thermal impact of the core debris 
2. facilitate cooling of the core debris 
3. minimize generation of non-condensable gases and radioactive products 
4. preclude unfiltered and uncontrolled release from containment 
Guidance 
Provisions for DECs vary greatly between designs. The claimed functionality and analysis should be 
supported by adequate evidence. 
The containment leakage rate in DECs with core damage should not exceed the design leakage rate for 
a sufficient period to allow for the implementation of offsite emergency measures. This period should 
be demonstrated, with reasonable confidence, to be at least 24 hours. 
The design should minimize generation of combustible, non-condensable gases from corium-concrete 
interaction. 
Containment venting design should take into account such factors as: 
• 
ignition of flammable gases 
• 
generation of non-condensable gases 
• 
impact on filters by containment environmental conditions, such as radioactive materials, high 
temperature and high humidity 
Experimental or analytical evidence should be provided to demonstrate that venting will not lead to 
unfiltered and uncontrolled releases of radioactive materials into the environment. 
6.7 
Heat transfer to an ultimate heat sink 
The design shall include systems for transferring residual heat from SSCs important to safety to an 
ultimate heat sink. This overall function shall be subject to very high levels of reliability during 
operational states, DBAs and DECs. All systems that contribute to the transport of heat by conveying 
heat, providing power, or supplying fluids to the heat transport systems shall therefore be designed in 
accordance with the importance of their contribution to the function of heat transfer as a whole. 
Natural phenomena and human induced events shall be taken into account in the design of heat transfer 
systems, and in the choice of diversity and redundancy, both in the ultimate heat sinks and in the 
storage systems from which fluids for heat transfer are supplied. 
The design shall extend the capability to transfer residual heat from the core to an ultimate heat sink so 
that, in the event of a severe accident considered as a DEC: 
1. acceptable conditions can be maintained in SSCs needed for mitigation of severe accidents 
2. radioactive materials can be confined 
3. releases to the environment can be limited 
May 2023 
REGDOC-2.5.2, Design of Reactor Facilities, Version 2.1 
121 
 
Guidance 
The safety significance and reliability requirements of the heat transfer to an ultimate heat sink should 
be addressed with respect to any claims made in the safety case for their availability to provide cooling 
for operational states, DBAs and DECs. 
6.8 
Emergency heat removal system 
The design shall include an emergency heat removal system (EHRS) which provides for removal of 
residual heat in order to meet fuel design limits and reactor coolant boundary condition limits. 
If the design of the plant is such that the EHRS is required to mitigate the consequences of a DBA, then 
the EHRS shall be designed as a safety system. There shall be reasonable confidence that the EHRS 
will function during DECs, if required. 
Correct operation of the EHRS equipment following an accident shall not be dependent on power 
supplies from the electrical grid or from the turbine generators associated with any reactor unit that is 
located on the same site as the reactor involved in the accident. 
Where water is required for the EHRS, it shall come from a source that is independent of normal 
supplies. 
The design shall support maintenance and reliability testing without a reduction in system effectiveness 
below what is required by the OLCs. 
As far as practicable, inadvertent operation of the EHRS, or of part of the EHRS, shall not have a 
detrimental effect on plant safety. 
If the fire water supply or system components are interconnected with the EHRS, operation of one shall 
not impair operation of the other. 
Guidance 
The emergency heat removal system is to provide a path to the ultimate heat sink, in the case that 
normal heat removal capabilities are not available. The purpose of this system is to prevent events from 
escalating and to mitigate their consequences. 
Emergency heat removal relates to post-accident heat removal and may be provided by a number of 
systems, depending on circumstances: 
• 
post-LOCA heat removal may be provided by ECCS (refer to section 6.5) 
• 
for non-LOCA events, emergency heat removal may be through primary or secondary cooling 
systems 
For all means of emergency heat removal, the design should be such that all equipment is appropriately 
designed to function in the class of accidents for which it is credited. 
If the system credited has another role in normal operation, then the design should be such that the 
system will meet the requirements of a safety system when used in DBAs or DECs. The design basis 
requirements for the system in this role should be provided. 
May 2023 
REGDOC-2.5.2, Design of Reactor Facilities, Version 2.1 
122 
 
Many of the actions associated with operation of the systems credited for emergency heat removal may 
not be initiated automatically. When there is reliance on manual operation, the review of human factors 
considerations should have very high importance. 
Primary side emergency heat removal could be through normal shutdown cooling means. The design 
should be such that: 
• 
a means of depressurizing the primary system is provided and the means of depressurization meets 
the requirements of a safety system, or 
• 
the shutdown cooling system is capable of being operated at full primary pressure and temperature 
Passive or non-passive (e.g., natural circulation or pumped) heat removal may be used. Non-passive 
systems require emergency power. Natural circulation systems should demonstrate capability over the 
full range of applicable operating conditions. 
Secondary side emergency heat removal that relies on water being provided to the secondary side of 
steam generators may be provided by a separate pumped supply or by a secondary depressurization and 
gravity feed. The water supply should meet the requirements of a safety system. 
6.9 
Electrical power systems 
The design shall specify the required functions and performance characteristics of each electrical power 
system that provides normal, standby, emergency and alternate power supplies to ensure: 
1. sufficient capacity to support the safety functions of the connected loads in operational states, 
DBAs and DECs 
2. availability and reliability is commensurate with the safety significance of the connected loads 
The requirements of both the standby and emergency power systems may be met by a single system. 
Electrical power systems shall be designed to include the various modes of interaction between offsite 
power and onsite power. In addition, design provisions shall be established for coping with grid 
disturbances, including conditions caused by solar flare (coronal mass ejection) events. 
The design shall specify: 
1. environmental and electromagnetic conditions to which electrical equipment and cables may be 
subjected 
2. limits on electromagnetic emissions conducted or radiated from electrical equipment 
The electrical power systems shall include appropriate protection, control, monitoring and testing 
facilities. 
Guidance 
A systematic approach should be followed to identify the electrical power systems needed in order to 
ensure that SSCs necessary to fulfill the safety functions are powered from electrical power supplies 
with appropriate safety classification and reliability. 
The design bases, design criteria, regulatory documents, standards, and other documents that will be 
used to design the electrical power systems should be specified. 
May 2023 
REGDOC-2.5.2, Design of Reactor Facilities, Version 2.1 
123 
 
For each of the electrical power systems, the design bases include: 
• 
consideration of all modes of operation, plant states up to DECs and all credible events that could 
impact the electrical power systems 
• 
reliability and availability targets for systems and key equipment 
• 
capacity and performance requirements 
• 
identification of all loads (i.e., the systems and equipment that require electric power to perform 
their safety functions) including electrical characteristics, maximum demand conditions, and safety 
classification 
• 
protective schemes and coordination of protection 
• 
specification of acceptable ranges of voltage and frequency for continuous operation of the 
connected loads for each electrical power system 
• 
identification of acceptable ranges for onsite and offsite transient disturbance events that could 
impact electrical power systems 
The design should specify the requirements for the preferred power supply (PPS) (i.e., the normal 
alternating current (AC) power supplies for plant electrical systems important to safety) and the plant 
interface with the transmission grid to reduce the potential for loss of normal AC power supplies. 
Transmission system studies should be undertaken for reasonably expected grid system conditions and 
disturbances to demonstrate that normal AC power supplies will not be degraded to a level that causes 
unnecessary challenges to safety systems, standby and emergency power supply systems. Performance 
criteria should be established for: 
• 
unit generator performance during defined frequency and voltage excursions to ensure that 
generators remain connected to the electrical grid 
• 
lightning and surge protection design provisions to protect the plant electrical distribution systems 
against transient over-voltage conditions such as switching and lightning surges 
The normal AC electrical power systems should have the capacity and capability to supply all plant 
electrical loads during operational states, DBAs and DECs. 
Normal AC power supplies should be designed to: 
• 
prevent deviations from normal operation 
• 
prevent single failures from impacting more than 1 redundant division of electrical power supply 
• 
avoid preventable challenges to standby and emergency systems as a result of an electrical system 
disturbance, transient, or upset condition (e.g., turbine-generator trip) 
Electrical power supply from the offsite power system to the onsite power system should be provided 
by a minimum of 2 physically independent transmission lines designed and located in order to minimize 
the likelihood of their simultaneous failure. The safety analysis should provide information concerning 
offsite power circuits coming from the transmission system to the plant switchyard. A switchyard 
common to both circuits is acceptable, but separate transmission line towers should be used. For some 
reactor designs, it might be sufficient to have only 1 offsite power connection, although this should be 
justified. 
Each of the plant’s offsite transmission lines should have the capacity and capability to supply power to 
all plant electrical loads under all plant states. 
May 2023 
REGDOC-2.5.2, Design of Reactor Facilities, Version 2.1 
124 
 
A minimum of 1 offsite transmission line and associated PPS should be designed to be automatically 
available to provide power to its associated safety divisions within a few seconds following an AOO or 
a DBA. 
A second PPS circuit should be designed to be available within a period of time commensurate with the 
requirement to support plant safety functions during AOOs and DBAs. 
For plants designed for house load operation, the normal AC power system should be designed to 
accommodate generator voltage and frequency transients associated with transferring from normal 
operation to the house load operating mode.

6.9.1 
Standby and emergency power systems 
The standby and emergency power systems shall have sufficient capacity and reliability, for a specified 
mission time, and in the presence of a single failure to provide the necessary power to: 
1. maintain the plant in a safe shutdown state and ensure nuclear safety in DBAs and DECs 
2. support severe accident management actions 
Dedicated onsite fuel storage facilities shall have a sufficient quantity of fuel to operate standby and 
emergency power sources while supplying connected loads. 
The PPS to the electrical power systems shall be from offsite power or the main generator. 
The design shall: 
1. identify all events for which actuation of standby and emergency power sources is required 
May 2023 
REGDOC-2.5.2, Design of Reactor Facilities, Version 2.1 
125 
 
2. specify the required start-up time and safety load energization times for standby and emergency 
power sources such that they are available in a time commensurate with the safety function of the 
connected loads 
3. specify conditions for electrical protection to trip standby and emergency power sources to protect 
equipment from significant failure 
4. minimize challenges to standby and emergency power supplies as a result of an electrical system 
disturbance or transient condition 
5. specify requirements for standby and emergency power supplies including all support auxiliaries 
and fuel supplies 
The design of the emergency power system shall take into account common-cause failures involving 
loss of normal power supply and standby power supply (if applicable). The emergency power system 
shall be electrically independent, physically separate and diverse from normal power supply and 
standby power system (if applicable). 
The standby and emergency power sources shall: 
1. preferably be initiated automatically 
2. be capable of being periodically tested under load conditions representing full load demand and full 
mission time 
Guidance 
Standby and emergency power sources should consist of complete electrical generating units including 
all support auxiliaries, a stored energy supply for starting and a dedicated and independent fuel supply 
system with onsite storage. 
The stored energy supply for starting standby or emergency power sources should have sufficient stored 
energy for 5 consecutive start attempts. 
6.9.2 
DC and uninterruptible power systems 
The design of the direct current (DC) power systems and uninterruptible AC power systems (if 
applicable) shall specify operating mission times when performing the intended safety functions of the 
connected loads and meet the capacity requirements of section 5.10. 
The design shall include provisions for periodic testing for DC power and uninterruptible AC power 
supplies to confirm their capability. 
Guidance 
DC power systems 
DC power systems important to safety should be designed to be independent of the effects of DBAs to 
which they must respond, and be fully functional during and following such accidents. 
Redundant load groups should each have a DC power supply division consisting of 1 or more batteries, 
1 or more battery chargers, distribution system, protection and isolation features. 
Each DC power supply division should be independent and physically separate from other DC 
divisions. 
May 2023 
REGDOC-2.5.2, Design of Reactor Facilities, Version 2.1 
126 
 
Battery chargers should be designed to prevent transients on the AC supply from affecting the 
functioning of the DC system, and DC transients from affecting the AC supply. 
Uninterruptible AC power systems 
Uninterruptible AC power systems important to safety should be designed to be independent of the 
effects of design-basis accidents to which they must respond, and be fully functional during and 
following such accidents. 
Each division of an uninterruptible AC power system should consist of: 
• 
an AC power supply and a DC power supply to an inverter 
• 
a separate AC power supply from the same division 
• 
a feature to automatically switch between the inverter output and the separate AC supply 
The electrical characteristics and requirements of the connected loads should be considered in the 
design so that interactions with the uninterruptible AC power system do not degrade the safety support 
functions of the loads supplied. 
Uninterruptible AC power systems should be designed to prevent transients on the AC supply to the 
battery charger or on the DC supply to the inverter from affecting the functioning of the inverter. 
6.9.3 
Alternate AC power supply 
The electrical power system design shall include provisions for mitigating the complete loss of onsite 
and offsite AC power. This is accomplished by the use of onsite portable, transportable or fixed power 
sources or offsite portable or transportable power sources, or a combination of these. 
The alternate AC power source shall be available and located at or nearby the reactor facility, and shall: 
1. be connectable to but not normally connected to the offsite or onsite standby and emergency AC 
power systems 
2. have minimum potential for common mode failure with offsite power or the onsite standby and 
emergency AC power sources 
3. be available in a timely manner after the onset of a station blackout 
4. have sufficient capacity and reliability for operation of all systems required for coping with station 
blackout and for the time required to bring and maintain the plant in a safe shutdown state 
The design shall include provision for periodic capacity testing of the alternate power supply to confirm 
its capability to cope with a station blackout event. 
Guidance 
The plant’s capability to maintain critical parameters (reactor coolant inventory, containment 
temperature and pressure, room temperatures where critical equipment is located) and to remove decay 
heat from irradiated fuel should be analyzed for the period that the plant is in a station blackout (SBO) 
condition. 
The capability of the DC systems required to monitor critical parameters and power the lighting and 
communication systems during an SBO should be evaluated for adequacy. 
May 2023 
REGDOC-2.5.2, Design of Reactor Facilities, Version 2.1 
127 
 
6.10 
Control facilities 
6.10.1 Main control room 
The design shall provide for a main control room (MCR) from which the plant can be safely operated, 
and from which measures can be taken to maintain the plant in a safe state or to bring it back into such a 
state after the onset of AOOs, DBAs or DECs. 
The design shall identify events both internal and external to the MCR that may pose a direct threat to 
its continued operation, and shall provide practicable measures to minimize the effects of these events. 
The safety functions that can be initiated by automatic control logic in response to an accident shall be 
capable of being initiated manually from the MCR. 
The layout of the controls and instrumentation, and the mode and format used to present information, 
shall provide operating personnel with an adequate overall picture of the status and performance of the 
plant and provide the necessary information to support operator actions. 
The design of the MCR shall be such that appropriate lighting levels and thermal environment are 
maintained, and noise levels shall be minimized in accordance with applicable standards and codes. 
The design of the MCR shall take ergonomic factors into account to provide both physical and visual 
accessibility to controls and displays, without adverse impact on health and comfort. This includes 
hardwired display panels as well as computerized displays, with the aim of making these displays as 
user-friendly as possible. 
Cabling for the I&C equipment in the MCR shall be arranged such that a fire in the secondary control 
room (SCR) cannot disable the equipment in the MCR. 
The design shall provide visual and, if appropriate, audible indications of plant conditions and processes 
that have deviated from normal operation and that could affect safety. 
The design shall also allow for the display of information needed to monitor the effects of the automatic 
actions of all control, safety, and safety support systems. 
The MCR shall be provided with secure communication channels to the emergency support facilities 
and to offsite emergency response organizations, and to allow for extended operating periods. 
Guidance 
There should be sufficient displays in the MCR to monitor all safety functions. 
The design should prevent unsafe manual operations (e.g., by using logic interlocking, depending on the 
plant status). 
Where safety and non-safety systems are brought into close proximity, the design should keep adequate 
functional isolation and physical separation. 
Appropriate measures are taken, including the provision of barriers between the control rooms and the 
external environment, and adequate information is provided for the protection of occupants of the 
control room against hazards such as high radiation levels resulting from DBAs or DECs, release of 
radioactive material, fire, or explosive or toxic gases. 
May 2023 
REGDOC-2.5.2, Design of Reactor Facilities, Version 2.1 
128 
 
The manual initiation of safety functions provides a form of defence in depth for abnormal conditions 
(including the common-cause failure of the automatic control and protection systems) and supports 
long-term post-accident operation. Manual actuation should be provided to both system and component 
levels, where appropriate. 
The display and manual controls for critical safety functions initiated by operator action should be 
diverse from computerized automatic safety systems. 
Habitability assessments should be conducted for all control facilities. The minimum duration of 
habitability should be sufficient to fulfill the required safety function in each facility. Criteria for 
control room habitability should be established. 
6.10.2 Safety parameter display system 
The MCR shall contain a safety parameter display system (SPDS) that presents sufficient information 
on safety-critical parameters for the diagnosis and mitigation of DBAs and DECs. 
The SPDS shall have the following capabilities: 
1. display safety-critical parameters within the full range expected in operational states, DBAs and 
DECs 
2. track data trends 
3. indicate when process or safety limits are being approached or exceeded 
4. display the status of safety systems 
The SPDS shall be designed and installed such that the same information is made available in a secure 
manner to the emergency response facility. 
The SPDS shall be integrated and harmonized with the overall control room human-system interface 
design. 
Guidance 
The primary function of the SPDS is to serve as an operator aid in the rapid detection of abnormal 
conditions, by providing a display of plant parameters from which the safety status of operation may be 
assessed in the control room. The display system may include other functions that aid operating 
personnel in evaluating plant status. The design of the display system should be flexible to allow for 
future incorporation of advanced diagnostic concepts and evaluation techniques. 
The SPDS should display a minimum set of plant parameters or derived variables from which the safety 
status of the plant can be assessed. These parameters and variables relate to functions such as: 
• 
reactivity control 
• 
reactor core and irradiated fuel cooling 
• 
heat removal from primary system 
• 
reactor coolant system integrity 
• 
radioactivity control 
• 
containment integrity  
The SPDS should: 
• 
have sufficient availability and reliability 
May 2023 
REGDOC-2.5.2, Design of Reactor Facilities, Version 2.1 
129 
 
• 
not display unreliable or invalid data and alarms 
• 
be designed to meet the specified human factor usability requirements 
The display of abnormal operating conditions significant to safety should be distinctly different in 
appearance from the display depicting normal operating conditions. 
The information shown by the SPDS display should be presented in ways that are easy for the operators 
to read and understand. 
The display should be designed to improve the operator’s recognition, comprehension, and detection of 
abnormal operating states. 
6.10.3 Secondary control room 
The design shall provide an SCR that is physically and electrically separate from the MCR, and from 
which the plant can be placed and kept in a safe shutdown state when the ability to perform essential 
safety functions from the MCR is lost. 
The design shall identify all events that may pose a direct threat to the continued operation of the MCR 
and the SCR. The design of the MCR and the SCR shall be such that no event can simultaneously affect 
both control rooms to the extent that the essential safety functions cannot be performed. 
For any PIE, at least 1 control room shall be habitable and accessible by means of a qualified route. 
Instrumentation, control equipment, and displays shall be available in the SCR so that the essential 
safety functions can be performed, essential plant variables can be monitored, and operator actions are 
supported. 
Safety functions initiated by automatic control logic in response to an accident shall also be capable of 
being initiated manually from the SCR. 
The design of the SCR shall ensure that appropriate lighting levels and thermal environment are 
maintained, and noise levels align with applicable standards and codes. 
Ergonomic factors shall apply to the design of the SCR to ensure physical and visual accessibility to 
controls and displays, without adverse impact on health and comfort. These shall include hardwired 
display panels as well as computerized displays that are as user-friendly as possible. 
Cabling for the I&C equipment in the SCR shall be such that a fire in the MCR cannot disable the 
equipment in the SCR. 
The SCR shall be equipped with an SPDS similar to that in the MCR. At a minimum, this display 
system shall provide the information required to facilitate placing and keeping the plant in a safe 
shutdown state when the MCR is uninhabitable. 
The SCR shall be provided with secure communication channels to the emergency response facility and 
to offsite emergency response organizations. 
The SCR shall allow for extended operating periods.

Guidance 
Sufficient controls, indications, alarms and displays should be provided in the SCR to bring the plant to 
a safe state, to provide assurance that a safe state has been reached and maintained, and to provide 
operators with information on the status of the plant and the trends in key plant parameters. 
Suitable provisions outside the MCR should be made for transferring control to the SCR whenever the 
MCR is abandoned. 
There should be adequate routes through which, under emergency conditions, the operation staff from 1 
control room can safely leave and reach another control room. 
Refer to section 6.10.1 for other applicable design guidance and expectations. 
6.10.4 Emergency support facilities 
The design shall provide for onsite emergency support facilities that are separate from the plant control 
rooms for use by the technical support staff and emergency support staff in the event of an emergency. 
The emergency support facilities shall consist of a technical support centre (TSC) and an onsite 
emergency response facility (ERF). The technical support centre and the emergency response facility 
can be located in 1 place or separated. 
The emergency support facilities shall provide equipment, facilities, and communication means for 
trained staff to manage, control and coordinate any emergency response and to provide technical 
support to operations, emergency response organizations, and severe accident management evaluation. 
The emergency support facilities design shall ensure that appropriate lighting levels and thermal 
environment are maintained, and that noise levels are minimized in accordance with applicable 
standards and codes. 
The emergency support facilities shall include secure means of communication with the MCR, SCR, 
and other important points in the plant, and with onsite and offsite emergency response organizations. 
The design shall ensure that the emergency support facilities: 
1. include provisions to protect occupants over protracted periods from the hazards resulting from 
DBAs and DECs 
2. are equipped with adequate facilities to allow extended operating periods 
The emergency response facility shall include a SPDS similar to those in the MCR and in the SCR. 
Information about the radiological conditions in the plant and its immediate surroundings, and about 
meteorological conditions in the vicinity of the plant, shall be accessible from the ERF. 
Guidance 
The design provides emergency support facilities which include a technical support center and an onsite 
emergency response facility. 
May 2023 
REGDOC-2.5.2, Design of Reactor Facilities, Version 2.1 
131 
 
The TSC will provide the following functions: 
• 
provide technical support and plant management to plant operation personnel during emergency 
conditions 
• 
handle peripheral duties and communication not directly related to reactor manipulations in order to 
relieve the burden of reactor operators during emergency conditions 
• 
prevent congestion in the control rooms 
• 
perform emergency support functions until the emergency response facility is functional 
To facilitate the above functions, the TSC should be located as close as possible to control rooms of 
sufficient size to accommodate the technical support staff. 
Equipment should be provided to gather, store, and display data needed in the TSC to analyze plant 
conditions. 
The TSC should have a complete and up-to-date repository of plant records to aid the technical analysis 
and evaluation of emergency conditions. 
Equipment should be provided in the emergency response facility for the acquisition, display, and 
evaluation of all radiological, meteorological, and plant system data required to determine offsite 
protective measures. 
Equipment used in performing essential emergency response facility functions should be located within 
the ERF complex. However, supplemental calculations and analytical support of emergency response 
facility evaluations may be provided from facilities outside the emergency response facility. 
The ERF data system should be designed to achieve an appropriate level of reliability. 
The location of the ERF should ensure optimum functional and reliability characteristics for carrying 
out its specific functions. 
If the TSC and ERF are located in 1 place, then they should be physically separate from the control 
rooms with adequate distance to ensure the capability of carrying out their functions. 
In the case of plants with multiple units at a site, the emergency support facilities should be 
demonstrated to be adequate to respond to common-cause events in multiple units. 
6.10.5 Credit for operator action 
If operator action is required for actuation of any safety system or safety support system equipment, all 
of the following requirements shall apply: 
1. there are clear, well defined, validated, and readily available operating procedures that identify the 
necessary actions 
2. there is instrumentation in the control rooms to provide clear and unambiguous indication of the 
necessity for operator action 
3. following indication of the necessity for operator action inside the control rooms, there are at least 
30 minutes available before the operator action is required 
4. following indication of the necessity for operator action outside the control rooms, there is a 
minimum of 1 hour available before the operator action is required 
For automatically initiated safety systems and control logic actions, the design shall facilitate backup 
manual initiation from inside the appropriate control room. 
May 2023 
REGDOC-2.5.2, Design of Reactor Facilities, Version 2.1 
132 
 
Guidance 
The design should ensure that no failure of monitoring or display systems will influence the functioning 
of other safety systems. 
The available time before operator action can be credited should be counted from the receipt of an 
unambiguous indication of a potential accident (typically an alarm) and include diagnostic time. 
The time available to perform the actions should be based on the analysis of the plant response to AOOs 
and DBAs, using realistic assumptions. The time required for operator action should be based on a 
human factors engineering analysis of operator response time, which in turn is based on a documented 
sequence of operator actions. Uncertainties in the analysis of time required are identified and assessed. 
An adequate time margin should also be added to the analyzed time. 
If operator action is required for actuation of any safety function, other than meeting the requirements 
of this regulatory document, the analysis should also demonstrate that: 
• 
there is sufficient time available for the operator to perform the required manual action 
• 
the operator can perform the actions correctly and reliably in the time available 
The sequence of actions should use only alarms, controls, and displays that would be available in 
locations where the tasks will be performed and should be available in all scenarios analysed. 
A preliminary validation should be conducted to provide independent confirmation of the validity of the 
estimated “time available” and “time required” for human actions. The preliminary validation results 
should support the conclusion that the time required, including margin, to perform individual steps and 
the overall documented sequence of manual operator actions are reasonable, realistic, repeatable, and 
bounded by the initial analysis. 
An integrated system test should also be conducted to validate the manual actions credited in the safety 
analysis using a full-scale simulator. Tasks conducted outside the control room should be included in 
the integrated system validations. 
Where justified, alternative action times may be used. The alternative action times should make due 
allowance for the complexity of the action to be taken, and the time needed for activities such as 
diagnosing the event and accessing the field location.

vapours, or airborne particulates that may occur, in order to monitor and filter the effluent before it is 
released to the atmosphere. The filter units should be placed in a fully enclosed room with concrete 
walls and floors thick enough to protect station personnel from radiation. Monitors should be provided 
in the stack to detect any activity in the effluent. Gaseous activity from areas such as the fuel storage 
pools, service areas and active laboratories should also be monitored and filtered before discharge to the 
atmosphere.

Guidance 
Hydrogen mitigation in the spent fuel pool area is particularly important if it is envisaged that the pool 
may be used for fission product scrubbing as part of containment venting. Hydrogen mitigation in the 
spent fuel pool area may not be necessary if draining of the pool beyond make-up capability can be 
precluded. 
6.12.3 Detection of failed fuel 
The design shall provide a means for allowing reliable detection of fuel defects in the reactor, and the 
subsequent removal of failed fuel, if action levels are exceeded. 
Guidance 
The amount of failed fuel left in the core may impact the safety case of the design. The design should 
specify the criterion for continued operation with failed fuel in the core, or for unloading the fuel 
assembly from the core. The design should allow for the removal of failed fuel in as timely a manner as 
possible. The design should provide for the inspection and quarantine of failed fuel in the fuel handling 
and storage facilities.

8. provide suitable decontamination facilities 
Guidance 
The reactor facility should be divided into zones based on predicted dose rates, radioactive 
contamination levels, concentration of airborne radionuclides, access requirements and specific 
requirements (such as the need to separate safety trains). The criteria and rationale for radiation zone 
designations – including zone boundaries for normal, refuelling and accident conditions – should be 
provided. These criteria should be used as the basis for the radiation shielding design. 
May 2023 
REGDOC-2.5.2, Design of Reactor Facilities, Version 2.1 
137 
 
From a radiological protection perspective, careful assessment should be made of the access 
requirements for operation, inspection, maintenance, repair, replacement and decommissioning of 
equipment; these considerations should be incorporated into the design. The design should also provide 
lay down space for special tools and ease for servicing activities. The design should also have features 
such as platforms or walkways, stairs, or ladders that permit prompt accessibility for servicing or 
inspection of components located in higher radiation zones. 
The use of remote technology for maintenance and surveillance in high radiation areas should be 
considered and incorporated. Preference should be given to the use of appropriate engineering controls 
and design features over process or administrative controls. 
Reliable equipment that requires minimum surveillance, maintenance, testing and calibration should be 
chosen. 
Operating experience should be reflected in the criteria and rationale provided in the design.

6.13.1 Design for radiation protection 
The shielding design shall prevent radiation levels in operating areas from exceeding the prescribed 
limits. This shall include provision of appropriate permanent layout and shielding of SSCs containing 
radioactive materials, and the use of temporary shielding for maintenance and inspection work. 
To minimize radiation exposure, the plant layout shall provide for efficient operation, inspection, 
maintenance, and replacement. In addition, the design shall limit the amount of activated material and 
its build-up. 
The design shall account for frequently occupied locations, and support the need for human access to 
locations and equipment. 
Access routes shall be shielded where needed. 
The design shall enable operator access for actions credited for post-accident conditions. 
Adequate protection shall be provided against exposure to radiation and radioactive contamination 
during DBAs and DECs for those parts of the facility to which access is required. 
Guidance 
Shielding should be designed based on the zone delineation described in section 6.13. The shielding

6.13.2 Access and movement control 
The plant layout and procedures shall control access to radiation areas and areas of potential 
contamination. 
The design shall minimize the movement of radioactive materials and the spread of contamination, and 
provide appropriate decontamination facilities for personnel. 
Guidance 
Provisions should be made for controlling the exit(s) from the radiation zones. Monitoring of personnel 
and materials should be established at the access and egress points for the radiation zones. Access to 
areas of high dose rates or high levels of radioactive contamination should be controlled through the 
provision of lockable doors and interlocks. Routes for personnel through radiation zones and 
contamination zones should be minimized in order to reduce the time spent in transiting these zones. 
Radiation zones where personnel spend substantial time should be designed to the lowest practical dose 
rates and ALARA. 
Within the radiation zones, changing areas for personnel should be provided at selected locations to 
prevent the spread of radioactive contamination during maintenance and normal operation. Within these 
change areas, consideration should be given to the need for decontamination facilities for personnel, 
radiation monitoring instruments and storage areas for protective clothing. A physical barrier should 
clearly separate the clean area from the potentially contaminated area. 
6.13.3 Radiation monitoring 
Equipment shall be provided to ensure that there is adequate radiation monitoring in operational states, 
DBAs and DECs. 
Stationary alarming dose rate meters shall be provided:

operational states, DBAs and DECs 
4. to give sufficient information in the control room or at the appropriate control location for 
operational states, DBAs and DECs, to enable plant personnel to initiate corrective actions when 
necessary 
Monitors shall be provided for measuring the activity of radioactive substances in the atmosphere: 
1. for areas routinely occupied by personnel 
2. for areas where the levels of activity of airborne radioactive materials may, on occasion, be 
expected to necessitate protective measures 
3. to give an indication in the control room, or in other appropriate locations, of when a high 
concentration of radionuclides is detected

Safety analysis 
7.1 
General 
A safety analysis of the plant design shall include hazard analysis, deterministic safety analysis, and 
probabilistic safety assessment (PSA) techniques. The safety analysis shall demonstrate achievement of 
all levels of defence in depth, and confirm that the design is capable of meeting the applicable 
expectations, dose acceptance criteria and safety goals. 
Radioactive sources other than the reactor core, such as the spent fuel pool and fuel handling systems, 
shall be considered. Impacts for multiple units at a site, if applicable, shall be included. 
The first step of the safety analysis shall be to identify PIEs using a systematic methodology, such as 
failure modes and effects analysis. Both direct and indirect events shall be considered in PIE 
identification. Requirements and guidance for identification of PIEs is given in section 5.4 of this 
document.

7.2 
Analysis objectives 
The safety analysis shall be iterative with the design process, and result in 2 reports: a preliminary 
safety analysis report, and a final safety analysis report. 
The preliminary safety analysis shall assist in the establishment of the design-basis requirements for the 
items important to safety, and demonstrate whether the plant design meets applicable requirements. 
The final safety analysis shall: 
1. reflect the as-built plant 
2. account for postulated aging effects on SSCs important to safety 
3. demonstrate that the design can withstand and effectively respond to identified PIEs 
4. demonstrate the effectiveness of the safety systems and safety support systems 
5. derive the OLCs for the plant, including: 
a. operational limits and set points important to safety 
b. allowable operating configurations, and constraints for operational procedures 
6. establish requirements for emergency response and accident management 
7. determine post-accident environmental conditions, including radiation fields and worker doses, to 
confirm that operators are able to carry out the actions credited in the analysis 
8. demonstrate that the design incorporates sufficient safety margins 
9. confirm that the dose and derived acceptance criteria are met for all AOOs and DBAs 
10. demonstrate that all safety goals have been met 
Guidance 
The Class I Nuclear Facilities Regulations require a preliminary safety analysis report demonstrating 
the adequacy of the reactor facility design to be submitted in support of an application for a licence to 
construct a Class I nuclear facility. A final safety analysis report demonstrating the adequacy of the 
design is required for an application for a licence to operate a Class I nuclear facility. 
7.3 
Hazard analysis 
Hazard analysis shall collect and evaluate information about the reactor facility to identify the 
associated hazards and determine those that are significant and must be addressed. A hazard analysis 
shall demonstrate the ability of the design to effectively respond to credible common-cause events. 
As discussed in section 7.1, the first step of the hazard analysis is to identify PIEs. For each common-
cause PIE, the hazard analysis shall identify: 
1. applicable acceptance criteria (i.e., the success path criteria) 
2. the hazardous materials in the plant and at the plant site 
3. all qualified mitigating SSCs credited during and following the event; all non-qualified safety or 
safety support systems are assumed to fail, except in cases where their continued operation would 
result in more severe consequences 
4. operator actions and operating procedures for the event 
5. plant or operating procedure parameters for which the event is limiting  
 
The hazard analysis shall confirm that: 
1. the plant design incorporates sufficient diversity and separation to cope with credible common-
cause events 
May 2023 
REGDOC-2.5.2, Design of Reactor Facilities, Version 2.1 
141 
 
2. credited SSCs are qualified to survive and function during and following credible common-cause 
events, as applicable 
3. the following criteria are met: 
a. the plant can be brought to a safe shutdown state 
b. the integrity of the fuel in the reactor core can be maintained 
c. the integrity of the reactor coolant pressure boundary and containment can be maintained 
d. safety-critical parameters can be monitored by the operator 
The hazard analysis report shall include the findings of the analysis and the basis for those findings. 
This report shall also: 
1. include a general description of the physical characteristics of the plant that outlines the prevention 
and protection systems to be provided 
2. include the list of safe shutdown equipment 
3. define and describe the characteristics associated with hazards for all areas that contain hazardous 
materials 
4. describe the performance criteria for detection systems, alarm systems, and mitigation systems, 
including requirements such as seismic or environmental qualification 
5. describe the control and operating room areas and the protection systems provided for these areas, 
including additional facilities for maintenance and operating personnel 
6. describe the operator actions and operating procedures of importance to the given analysis 
7. identify the plant parameters for which the event is limiting 
8. explain the inspection, testing, and maintenance parameters needed to protect system integrity 
9. define the emergency planning and coordination requirements for effective mitigation, including 
any necessary measures to compensate for the failure or inoperability of any active or passive 
protection system or feature 
Guidance 
The objective of the hazard analysis is to determine the adequacy of protection of the reactor facility 
against internal and external hazards, while taking into account the plant design and site characteristics. 
To ensure the availability of required safety functions and operator actions, all the SSCs important to 
safety (including the main control room, secondary control room and emergency support facilities) 
should be adequately protected against relevant internal and external hazards. 
The hazard analysis should establish a list of relevant internal and external hazards that may affect plant 
safety. For the relevant hazards, the review should demonstrate, by using deterministic and probabilistic 
techniques, that the probability or consequences of the hazard are sufficiently low so that no specific 
protective measures are necessary, or that the preventive and mitigating measures against the hazard are 
adequate. 
All internal and external hazards are considered as part of PIEs. The hazards that make an insignificant 
contribution to plant risk can be screened out from the detailed analysis; however, the rationale for this 
screening should be provided. The remaining PIEs constitute the scope of the hazard analysis. The 
design should specify design-basis hazards, establishing clear criteria. The design-basis hazards should 
be analyzed using the deterministic safety analysis rules and criteria provided in section 9.4. Such 
analysis should also demonstrate the adequacy of the complementary design features in mitigating 
radiological consequences of design extension conditions. 
The hazard analysis should demonstrate that the design incorporates sufficient safety margins.

Environmental protection and mitigation 
8.1 
Design for environmental protection 
The design shall make adequate provision to protect the environment and to mitigate the impact of the 
reactor facility on the environment. A review of the design shall confirm that this provision has been 
made. 
A systematic approach shall be used to assess the potential biophysical environmental effects of the 
reactor facility on the environment, and the effects of the environment on the reactor facility. 
Guidance 
The design should incorporate the “best available technology and techniques economically achievable” 
(BATEA) principle for aspects of the design related to environmental protection. 
8.2 
Release of nuclear and hazardous substances 
The design shall demonstrate through process, monitoring, control, prevention, and mitigation measures 
that the releases of nuclear and hazardous substances will conform to the ALARA principle. 
The lifecycle assessment shall identify various sources of nuclear and hazardous substances in design, 
operation, and decommissioning, along with their possible environmental impacts on human and non-
human biota. 
Some of the factors that shall be considered include: 
1. resource requirements for the reactor facility such as fuel, energy, and water 
2. depletion of ground and surface water resources 
3. contamination of air, soil and water resources 
May 2023 
REGDOC-2.5.2, Design of Reactor Facilities, Version 2.1 
144 
 
4. nuclear and hazardous substances used 
5. types of waste generated – gaseous, liquid and solid 
6. quantities of waste generated 
7. impact of cooling water intake on entrainment and impingement 
8. impact of water output on the thermal regime of the receiving environment 
Technological options shall be considered in establishing design objectives for controlling and 
monitoring releases during start-up, normal operation, shutdown, and potential abnormal and 
emergency situations. Appropriate limits shall be included in the plant OLCs. 
Pollution prevention principles shall be applied when considering the technological design options for 
cooling water systems, in order to minimize adverse environmental impact. 
Guidance 
The design authority should demonstrate adherence to the principles of optimization and pollution 
prevention, through the demonstration of the application of the ALARA and BATEA principles. 
The lifecycle assessment referenced in this regulatory document should include an initial estimate of the 
total inventory of all radioactive and hazardous materials that will be used or generated during the 
plant’s lifetime. All systems at the reactor site should be accounted for, and consideration given to 
substances such as hydrazine, carbon dioxide, chloro-fluoro-carbons, volatile organic compounds, 
nitrogen oxides, total organic carbon, dust or suspended solids, detergent, solvents, heavy metals (e.g., 
copper), chlorine, phosphorous, ammonia and ammonium, morpholine, oil, or grease. The nature of 
such substances (solid, liquid, gas, pH, and temperature), their management and the wastes created 
should be accounted for. 
Pollution prevention principles should be applied through an assessment of various technological 
options, in order to identify the technology and techniques that are BATEA. The technological option 
selected for the design of cooling water systems should minimize the impact on the environment to the 
extent practicable given nuclear safety requirements. The economically achievable assessment of a 
technology option is not determined on the basis of a specific project, but rather at the industry level. 
Technical feasibility of an option depends upon site-specific conditions, taking into account 
environmental risk and socio-economic factors. The technology option of choice should be the one that 
best balances costs with environmental benefits resulting from application of a structured process of 
options analysis (e.g. cost-benefit analysis, multi-criteria decision analysis). It should include an 
assessment of: 
• 
the age of equipment and facilities involved 
• 
how the option is designed, built, maintained, operated and decommissioned 
• 
the process employed 
• 
the engineering aspects of the application of various types of control techniques 
• 
process changes 
• 
technological advances or changes in scientific knowledge and understanding 
• 
cost of achieving the environmental benefits or reducing the environmental impacts 
• 
socioeconomic factors 
• 
time limits for installation of new and existing plants 
• 
other environmental impacts (including energy requirements) 
• 
other such factors as deemed appropriate by the regulator 
The selected condenser cooling technology should incorporate the latest in mitigation technology and 
techniques.

Appendix A: Structural Analysis of Containment Structures 
This appendix provides further detailed guidance on acceptance criteria related to structural analysis of 
containment structures for robustness against malevolent acts in support of section 5.22. 
Detailed structural analyses of representative containment structures indicate that large displacements of the 
containment would be expected as well as induced vibrations. The structural acceptance criteria for global 
behaviour are related to the limitation of structural deflections (DBT and severe BDBT) or overall damage 
(extreme BDBT). Therefore, special attention should be given to: 
1. damage to the internal structures and to the containment due to extensive deformations of the containment 
building 
2. shock damage to fragile components directly attached to the containment wall 
3. induced vibration 
4. structural integrity of the reserve water tank (e.g., CANDU design) 
5. structural integrity of the polar crane 
Structural acceptance criteria for reinforced concrete elements are given in table 1. Acceptance criteria for steel 
are given in table 2.

Appendix B: Experimental Devices 
This appendix is applicable when the reactor core employs experimental devices such as loops for fuel 
and material testing, irradiation sites or beam tubes. 
The reactor behaviour under normal operation, transient and accident conditions shall be analyzed, 
including experimental devices. Any safety impact of any failure of experimental devices on the reactor 
core or that of any failure of the reactor core on the experimental devices shall be addressed. 
A design basis shall be established for each experimental device associated with the reactor facility. The 
radioactive inventory of the experimental device, as well as the potential for the generation or release of 
energy, shall be taken into consideration. 
Sufficient negative reactivity shall be available in the reactivity control devices so that the reactor can be 
brought to subcritical condition and maintained subcritical in normal operation and in accident conditions, 
with account taken of the experimental arrangements with the highest positive reactivity contribution. In 
the design of reactivity control devices, account shall be taken of aging and the effects of irradiation, such 
as burnup, changes in physical properties and the production of gas. 
If safety devices are interconnected with the safety system, they shall be designed to maintain the quality 
of the safety system. The possibility of deleterious interactions with the safety system shall be assessed. 
Trip parameters shall take into account the effects of experimental devices when employed in the reactor. 
Where necessary for the safety of the reactor and the safety of the experiment, the design shall provide 
appropriate monitoring of the parameters for experiments in the main control room and shall include 
specific safety features, if necessary, for the reactor systems, experimental devices and any other related 
facility. 
Requirements and limiting conditions for safe operation shall be prepared for experimental devices and 
incorporated into OLCs. 
The maximum rate of addition of positive reactivity allowed by an experiment when employed shall be 
specified and shall be limited to values justified. 
The preliminary decommissioning plan for the reactor facility shall include the decommissioning of any 
experimental device.
