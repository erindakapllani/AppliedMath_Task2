Preface 
This regulatory document is part of the CNSC's Human Performance Management series of regulatory 
documents, which also covers human performance programs and personnel certification. The full list of 
regulatory document series is included at the end of this document and can be found on the CNSC’s 
website. 
REGDOC-2.2.2, Personnel Training, sets out requirements and guidance for the analysis, design, 
development, implementation, evaluation, documentation and management of training at nuclear facilities 
within Canada, including the essential principles and elements of an effective training system.  
As one of many sub-systems used within an organization’s management system, the training system 
supports the organization’s operational capability by training workers to perform their jobs effectively. A 
training system also permits organizations to respond rapidly when a performance or personnel issue can 
best be addressed by training.  
In keeping with the CNSC’s regulatory philosophy and international practice, licensees are responsible 
for the safe operation of their respective nuclear facilities. They are therefore responsible for training and 
assessing their workers to ensure they are fully qualified to perform their duties in accordance with 
current regulatory requirements.  
REGDOC-2.2.2 is intended to form part of the licensing basis for a regulated facility or activity. It is 
intended for inclusion in licences as either part of the conditions and safety and control measures in a 
licence, or as part of the safety and control measures to be described in a licence application and the 
documents needed to support that application. 
Guidance contained in this document exists to inform the applicant, to elaborate further on requirements 
or to provide direction to licensees and applicants on how to meet requirements. It also provides more 
information about how CNSC staff evaluate specific problems or data during their review of licence 
applications. Licensees are expected to review and consider guidance; should they choose not to follow it, 
they should explain how their chosen alternate approach meets regulatory requirements.  
A graded approach, commensurate with risk, may be defined and used when applying the requirements 
and guidance contained in this regulatory document. The use of a graded approach is not a relaxation of 
requirements. With a graded approach, the application of requirements is commensurate with the risks 
and particular characteristics of the facility or activity.

Personnel Training 
1. 
Introduction  
The purpose of training in the nuclear industry is to ensure that workers are competent and 
qualified to perform the duties of their position. As required by the General Nuclear Safety and 
Control Regulations, workers shall be trained to carry on the licensed activity.  
A training system provides the basis for the analysis, design, development, implementation, 
evaluation, documentation and management of training for workers at nuclear facilities. It 
provides a method for meeting the training needs of workers and ensuring that the right people 
receive the right training at the right time. With a training system as defined in this regulatory 
document, it can be demonstrated that all required knowledge, skills and safety-related attributes 
have been attained, through the process of performance-based assessment and program 
evaluation. Without a training system, there is a risk that important elements of training will be 
omitted and the operating state of the facility will not be reflected in the training programs. 
1.1 
Purpose 
This regulatory document sets out the CNSC’s requirements for licensees regarding the 
development and implementation of a training system. It also provides guidance on how these 
requirements should be met. 
1.2 
Scope 
This regulatory document applies to workers engaged in licensed activities in nuclear facilities or 
where nuclear substances or prescribed equipment are produced, used, possessed, packaged or 
disposed of. This includes workers in positions where the consequence of human error poses a 
risk to the environment, the health and safety of persons, or to the security of the nuclear facilities 
and of nuclear substances. The licensees shall define these positions in their training system 
governing documents. 
1.3 
Relevant legislation 
The provisions of the Nuclear Safety and Control Act and regulations that are relevant to this 
regulatory document include: 
• 
paragraph 12(1)(a) of the General Nuclear Safety and Control Regulations, which states 
every licensee shall “ensure the presence of a sufficient number of qualified workers to carry 
on the licensed activity safely and in accordance with the Act, the regulations made under the 
Act and the licence” 
• 
paragraph 12(1)(b) of the General Nuclear Safety and Control Regulations, which states 
every licensee shall “train the workers to carry on the licensed activity in accordance with the 
Act, the regulations made under the Act and the licence”  
December 2016 
REGDOC-2.2.2, Personnel Training, Version 2

2. 
Principles 
The training system developed and implemented by each licensee shall adhere to the following 
two fundamental principles: 
 
1. Performance-oriented: Training is preparation for performance on the job. All instruction 
that is subject to this regulatory document shall focus on essential knowledge, skills and 
safety-related attributes required to meet job requirements and nuclear-safety-specific needs 
throughout the lifecycle of the facility. 
2. Systematically developed: Training shall be defined, produced and maintained through an 
iterative and interactive series of steps, leading from the identification of a training 
requirement to the confirmation that the requirement has been satisfied. 
3. 
Training Systems for Nuclear Facilities 
Licensees shall ensure workers who carry on licensed activities are qualified to do the work 
assigned to them through the use of a training system to systematically analyze, design, develop, 
implement, evaluate, document and manage new training and the revision of existing training, 
including continuing training. It shall be used whether the training is defined, designed, 
developed, implemented, evaluated, recorded and managed internally by licensees or externally 
through vendors or contractors.  
Requirements included in this section are to be applied in a manner that is commensurate with 
risk.  All requirements shall apply but the associated training-related processes and procedures 
may vary depending upon the safety significance and complexity of the work being performed. In 
considering safety, factors to be examined include the relative importance to safeguards and 
security; the magnitude of any hazard involved; the lifecycle stage of the facility; the type of 
facility or licensed activity; the particular characteristics of the facility or licensed activity (e.g., 
remote location, densely populated areas with easy access to qualified workers); and any other 
relevant factors.   
This regulatory document will serve as a performance-based guideline for licensees holding Class 
II Nuclear Facilities and Prescribed Equipment licences or Nuclear Substances and Radiation 
Devices licences. 
Licensees shall: 
1. identify all performance requirements of a job or duty area relating to licensed activities by 
conducting a job analysis to determine all of the tasks involved 
2. define and document the necessary general worker training, initial job training and continuing 
training requirements for workers, based on a task analysis of the knowledge, and skills 
required to perform each task and the safety-related attributes required to perform their duties  
3. ensure that appropriate training is designed, developed and implemented to meet the 
qualification requirements 
4. ensure that trainers meet and maintain documented qualification requirements, particularly in 
the areas of subject matter expertise and instructional skills 
5. ensure that formal evaluations are used to confirm and document that all trained workers are 
qualified to perform their duties  
December 2016 
REGDOC-2.2.2, Personnel Training, Version 2

6. implement a training change-management process that will systematically analyze procedural 
and equipment changes, changes in job descriptions, and operating experience feedback 
(including facility and industry-wide events), in order to identify changes to the tasks and task 
lists and to assess potential training implications leading to training modifications 
7. ensure continuing training is provided to workers as deemed necessary through the job and 
task analyses processes, and that it includes updates to training programs stemming from the 
change-management process as identified through the training needs analysis process 
8. evaluate training regularly and incorporate the results of the evaluations into a training 
improvement process 
9. ensure that workers’ records in support of training and qualifications are established and 
maintained 
10. ensure that workers have a level of training related to nuclear safety corresponding to the 
duties of their position and employment, including but not limited to radiation safety, fire 
safety, onsite emergency arrangements, and conventional health and safety 
4. 
Records Management for a Training System 
Licensees shall develop and manage documentation related to all phases of their training 
including analysis, design, development, implementation and evaluation.   
Licensees shall maintain records on the training and qualifications of all workers. These records 
shall be managed and controlled, and may be requested by CNSC staff at any time. Additionally, 
workers’ supervisors and managers shall have immediate, unencumbered and readily available 
access to the workers’ qualification records related to work being assigned or performed. The 
training record for each worker, including temporary workers and contractors, shall include all 
qualifications and certifications granted by or relied on by the licensee to fulfill requirements of 
this document and that are related to the duties of the worker at that facility. Records shall include 
expiration dates for time-sensitive qualifications and certifications, and all requalification or 
recertification requirements. 
5. 
Guidance on the Systematic Approach to Training  
The systematic approach to training (SAT) is a proven and highly successful education and 
training methodology, which licensees may adopt to meet the requirements in section 3 of this 
regulatory document. SAT is also widely known as the instructional systems design model 
(ISDM) or analysis, design, development, implementation and evaluation (ADDIE) model. 
A SAT-based training system provides interdependent functions consisting of analysis, design, 
development, implementation and evaluation. This cyclic process (see figure 1) allows training to 
be systematically analyzed, defined, designed, developed, implemented, evaluated, documented 
and managed – in order to not only meet operational and organizational requirements, but also to 
react quickly to changes in those requirements. 
Appendix A provides licensees with further guidance on using a systematic approach to training, 
particularly for the development of radiation safety training programs. The appendix contains a 
simple application of the process for developing a training program in accordance with section 5 
of this regulatory document.

5.1 
Analysis phase 
The analysis phase is the foundation of any training course or training program and includes 
inputs from operational staff, end-users, subject-matter experts and training development experts. 
Its purpose is to specify the required outcome of the training in terms of essential on-the-job 
performance as defined by role documents, procedures or written instructions. The analysis 
should consider the following points:  
• 
rationale and purpose of training 
• 
scope of the training 
• 
target audience 
• 
training method 
• 
location of the training 
• 
timeframe for completion of the training  
The fundamental processes of the analysis phase are briefly described in the following 
paragraphs. 
5.1.1 
Training needs analysis  
A training needs analysis (TNA) is often triggered by a performance gap or deficiency that has 
identified training as the solution. A TNA can be used to systematically assess job performance 
requirements against existing performance (gap analysis) and identify specific areas that require 
training. A TNA may also be used to assess skills and knowledge gaps created by engineering 
design and equipment changes, operational changes, revised procedures, and modifications to 
regulatory requirements.

5.1.2 
Job and task analysis 
To identify all performance requirements of a job or duty area, a job analysis should be conducted 
to determine all of the tasks involved with all states of the nuclear facility, including normal 
operations, accident conditions and emergencies. The end result of a job analysis is a list of tasks 
that should be completed to perform the job correctly. Task difficulty, importance and frequency 
(DIF) are considered to determine which tasks need to be part of training and to determine the 
initial and continuing training content. A task analysis is conducted to determine the method of 
task performance and associated knowledge, skills and safety-related attributes. While the 
knowledge and skills should be determined for each task, safety-related attributes need not be 
developed for each task but can be developed collectively and documented for a job or duty area. 
5.1.3 
Learning objectives  
Terminal learning objectives (TLOs) are statements of the tasks that the workers must be able to 
demonstrate after completing the training. TLOs should be measurable and define exactly when, 
what and how well the trainee must be capable of performing on the job upon completion of the 
training. 
A terminal learning objective should include the following: 
• 
Performance statement: states the task to be performed 
• 
Condition statement: describes conditions under which the performance must be completed 
• 
Standards: state the measurable criteria that describe how well the performance should be 
completed 
5.1.4 
Target audience analysis  
A target audience analysis determines the numbers and categories of workers to be trained and, 
where possible, the characteristics of the individuals who will receive the training (e.g., current 
job experience and prior background, experience, education and training). This information 
ensures that the training is designed, developed and implemented at the correct level, and assists 
with determining any necessary training prerequisites, including the minimum entry level 
education and training. 
Appendix A contains a practical example of an analysis phase of SAT conducted in accordance 
with the principles of this regulatory document.  
5.2 
Design phase   
The design phase should include the selection and description of the training and an environment 
that will enable the trainees to achieve the TLOs determined in the analysis phase. The design 
phase starts with the results of the analysis phase and ends with a plan for the development of the 
training. The design phase takes the output from the analysis phase and specifies how the 
information will be presented and how the knowledge, skills and safety-related attributes will be 
tested.  
The fundamental processes of the design phase are briefly described in the following paragraphs.  
5.2.1 
Trainee characteristics  
As a result of the analysis phase, the target audience should have been broadly defined. During 
this phase, the trainee characteristics should be further described in terms of their entry-level 
December 2016 
REGDOC-2.2.2, Personnel Training, Version 2 
 
 
6 
 
knowledge, skills and safety-related attributes, and those characteristics likely to affect their 
responses to particular instructional activities. Information obtained in this process will guide 
subsequent decisions such as those regarding appropriate instructional sequences, methods and 
media, and help tailor the training to trainees’ needs and learning characteristics. 
5.2.2 
Instructional program design 
The instructional program design determines the knowledge, skills and safety-related attributes 
required to perform a task. These knowledge, skills and safety-related attributes lead to enabling 
objectives (EOs), which document the knowledge, skills and safety-related attributes. These EOs 
are then grouped and sequenced into the order most suitable for learning.   
5.2.3 
Enabling objectives  
EOs are the principal units of learning and constitute a major step towards achieving the 
associated TLOs. As sub-components of TLOs, EOs represent manageable units of work: units 
that are coherent in terms of logic, learning of work, and that have a suitable scope and are 
appropriate for testing learning progress. Like a TLO, an EO is composed of three essential parts:  
 
• 
Performance statement: an observable action normally stated as one action associated with a 
single verb. If the action is complicated or if more than one verb is used, then the EO needs to 
be broken down further into other EOs with simple actions. 
• 
Conditions statement: a description of the setting or conditions under which the task is to be 
performed. Ideally, the conditions should mirror those in the workplace where the operation 
is performed.  
• 
Standard: one or more measurable criterion stating the level of acceptable performance of the 
task in terms of quantity, quality or time limitations. It should answer questions such as “How 
many?”, “How fast?” or “How well?” 
5.2.4 
Learning assessment plan  
A learning assessment plan describes the use of formal evaluations within the qualification 
program. The learning assessment plan determines how progress towards, and achievement of, 
the required performance is checked and verified. While an assessment should be based upon the 
performance defined in the TLOs or EOs, limiting factors (such as time) may not permit direct 
observation of the full range of desired performance. The assessment plan describes how a valid 
and reliable sample of trainee performance will be measured and evaluated. 
5.2.5 
Instructional strategies 
The instructional strategy is the combination of media, methods and environment used in the 
delivery of training. The advantages and disadvantages of each instructional strategy, as applied 
to the TLOs and EOs, should be examined to ensure that the most effective solution is selected to 
produce graduates capable of performing tasks as indicated in the TLOs.  
5.2.6 
On-the-job training  
On-the-job training (OJT) requirements should be considered when one or more of the TLOs may 
not be suitable for traditional instructional methods. If OJT is necessary, then OJT learning 
objectives, complete with performance statements, conditions and standards, should be produced. 
Subsequently, each OJT learning objective should be formally assessed using on-the-job 
evaluation. 
December 2016 
REGDOC-2.2.2, Personnel Training, Version 2 
 
 
7 
 
5.2.7 
Training development plan 
The training development plan documents the decisions made during the design phase. Outcomes 
and decisions regarding items covered in sections 5.2.1 through 5.2.6 should be documented and 
used during the development phase.  
5.3 
Development phase  
The development phase involves the procurement or production of effective instructional 
materials in accordance with the training development plan.  
The fundamental processes of the development phase are briefly described in the following 
paragraphs. 
5.3.1 
Procurement/production of instructional materials 
Instructional materials should support the learning activities. Such items include instructor lesson 
plans, interactive courseware such as computer-based training and training aids of all types 
including equipment, references, job aids and testing materials. The instructional materials should 
include the following, where necessary: 
• 
Trainee manuals: These are reference handbooks to be used and often retained by the 
trainees. 
• 
Instructor guides: These are instructional specifications for use by the instructor during 
training preparation and delivery. They outline the specific training steps that must be used to 
satisfy the training development plan.  
• 
Handouts: These additional aids can supplement the trainee manuals in areas identified as 
difficult and/or particularly important.  
• 
Computer-based training or other media: These are to be used where they are the 
recommended solution based on the instructional analysis and the selection of the 
instructional strategy. 
• 
Question banks and some sample tests: When used during the training, these should include 
guidance on where and when they should be used. 
5.3.2 
Assessment tests 
Assessment tests, which address the requirement for formal evaluation, cover both progress and 
final testing. In general, there are two types and both should be developed.  
Knowledge or cognitive assessments: Usually written, these tests can include multiple choice, 
multiple response, dichotomous or binary (e.g., yes/no; true/false), matching, resequencing, and 
open-ended questions. 
 
Performance or skill-based assessments: These are practical tests based on realistic scenarios of 
the most important and significant skills and safety-related attributes derived from the TLOs and 
EOs.  
5.3.3 
Conduct of trials (pilot courses)    
To assess the effectiveness of the training and related materials, these materials should be 
reviewed by subject-matter experts, tested with individuals who are representative of the target 
training audience, and approved by the appropriate managers. The training and instructional 
materials should be revised according to the findings of the trials.

5.4 
Implementation phase  
The implementation phase is to enable the trainees to successfully perform the tasks to the 
standards defined in the TLOs. This phase encompasses both the instructor preparation phase as 
well as the actual delivery of the training.  
It should include: 
• 
lesson plans based on the training development plan and the instructor guides prepared during 
the development phase 
• 
set-up of the training environment 
• 
continual monitoring to ensure that learning is taking place 
• 
arrangements for follow-on training, where necessary 
5.5 
Evaluation phase 
The evaluation phase involves the assessment of the effectiveness and efficiency of the training as 
delivered and verification of whether the trainees have mastered the TLOs and acquired the 
competence needed to perform the job safely.  
The evaluation phase includes the following: 
• 
Formal trainee evaluation: The trainees’ abilities to perform the tasks, as defined in the TLOs, 
should be measured through tests and assessments. This activity can be included as a process 
within the implementation phase. 
• 
Content and delivery: All course content and instructional strategies, methodologies and 
activities, including trainee evaluations, are monitored and assessed so that corrective actions 
can be taken if necessary. Sources of feedback include the trainees, the instructors, the 
support staff and the responsible managers and supervisors.  
• 
Effectiveness: This means the graduates’ ability to perform, in the workplace, the tasks for 
which they were trained. The primary sources of this information are the graduates and their 
supervisors. Additionally, information may be available through various sources ranging 
from needs assessments and lessons-learned reports to incident reports and rework statistics. 
Managers and supervisors should have continuous input to the training. 
• 
Change management: In accordance with the principles of a SAT methodology, inputs such 
as new or revised regulatory requirements, engineering design and equipment changes, 
operational changes, revised procedures, modifications and operating experience feedback 
(including facility and industry-wide events) should be regularly fed into the appropriate 
processes through the analysis phase.

Appendix A – Additional Guidance for Using REGDOC-2.2.2 to Develop Radiation 
Safety Training Programs for Workers Involved in Licensed Activities with Nuclear 
Substances and Radiation Devices, and with Class II Nuclear Facilities and 
Prescribed Equipment 
An effective radiation safety training program is essential to protecting health, safety, security and the 
environment, and is considered part of a comprehensive occupational health and safety program. 
This appendix provides additional guidance on the implementation of the requirements of REGDOC 
2.2.2, Personnel Training. The high-level process diagram presented on the following page and the 
subsequent supporting descriptions provide guidance regarding how SAT-based processes and procedures 
could be applied for developing radiation safety training programs. A practical example of the analysis 
phase of SAT is also provided for information purposes. 
Licensees with relatively few worker categories performing relatively few or straightforward tasks may 
determine that a simplified training program is adequate to meet the need of their workers. The CNSC 
requires that each of the process steps be included to the appropriate degree in developing even the 
simplest radiation safety training program. 
The topics to be covered by a training program, and the depth to which they should be addressed, will 
depend on the complexity of the licensed activity, the specific duties of workers, the radiological risk 
associated with those duties, and previous training and experience.  
Simplified process for developing a radiation safety training program in accordance with the principles of 
REGDOC-2.2.2 
Identify jobs with potential 
radiological risk. 
Is there a training need?
Link each task to 
appropriate training 
references and define 
exactly, what, when and 
how the trainee should be 
able to perform the task at 
the conclusion of training. 
(terminal learning 
objectives - TLOs)
Based on DIF of each 
task, determine whether 
training will be initial or 
initial and continuing. If 
continuing training is 
deemed appropriate 
assign a frequency.  
(ex: every year)
Objectively determine 
how difficult, the 
importance to safety and 
how frequent the tasks 
are performed. (DIF)
Identify the knowledge, 
skills and safety related 
attributes associated with 
each task.
For each identified 
job, create a task list.
Define worker categories 
and worker characteristics 
involved with the identified 
jobs.
Based on TLOs, organize 
training into discrete 
topics and ensure a 
logical sequence.
Determine if testing/ 
assessment will be 
written, practical or a 
combination.
Define and document test 
items for assessment of 
workers.
Determine appropriate 
training delivery method
. 
(classroom, on-the-job, 
computer based)
Create lesson plans for 
each topic. Review 
existing training material 
to determine suitability.
Create a feedback form to

Practical example of analysis phase of SAT conducted in accordance with the principles of REGDOC-2.2.2
A licensee identifies that persons 
shipping radioactive material must 
know how to use a radiation survey 
meter to measure dose rates. Training 
is required. 
The licensee conducts a job and task 
analysis, ranks difficulty, importance 
and frequency (DIF)* of each task 
numerically (in this case on a scale of 
1-5) and produces associated table 
(below) which includes training 
decisions and links to specific training 
references. 
The licensee identifies two positions 
within its organization that are 
responsible for conducting radiation 
surveys using a survey meter. 
Following formal review and approval 
of the analysis, the licensee proceeds 
to complete the remaining SAT phases 
detailed on the previous page.
This example is provided for information purposes only.

Scenario:
*DIF is used to rank tasks to determine the level of training required. For difficulty and importance, a higher number indicates greated difficulty or importance. For frequency, a higher number indicates an infrequent task. Tasks with a 
high sum of DIF have greater training needs, marking the potential for continuing training. The numbers provided in the table are examples only and may differ from those produced by a licensee for a job, or a task analysis, of a 
similar job.

Glossary 
continuing training  
A structured curriculum that maintains and enhances knowledge, skills and safety-related attributes, and 
that addresses areas such as equipment changes and procedure changes; skill weaknesses; infrequently 
used and difficult knowledge and skills, and lessons learned from operating experiences. Update training, 
requalification training and refresher training are also considered continuing training.  
duty area 
One of the job incumbent’s main areas of activity, or a grouping of closely related tasks. 
enabling objective  
A principal unit of learning that constitutes a major step towards achieving associated terminal learning 
objective(s). It consists of a performance statement, condition statement and a standard. 
instructional strategy  
The combination of media, methods and environment used in the delivery of training: 
• 
method: the type of learning activity or instructional event 
• 
media: the means of delivering instructional activities to the trainee, such as computers or 
printed texts 
• 
environment: where learning activities take place; e.g., classroom, workplace, home 
job 
The work performed by the incumbent in a position, or by a group of incumbents in a position who 
perform essentially the same duties and tasks and require similar knowledge, skills and safety-related 
attributes to perform those tasks.
