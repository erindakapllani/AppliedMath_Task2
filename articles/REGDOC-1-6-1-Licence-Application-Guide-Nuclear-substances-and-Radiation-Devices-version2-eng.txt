Preface 
This regulatory document is part of the CNSC’s Nuclear Substances and Devices series of regulatory 
documents. The full list of regulatory document series is included at the end of this document and can 
also be found on the CNSC’s website. 
In accordance with the Nuclear Safety and Control Act (NSCA) and the regulations made under the 
NSCA, individuals wanting to possess, use, store, transfer, import, export, service and abandon nuclear 
substances and radiation devices require a licence issued by the CNSC. The NSCA prohibits the CNSC 
from issuing a licence unless the CNSC considers that the applicant is qualified, has made adequate 
provision for the protection of the environment and the health and safety of persons, and otherwise meets 
the requirements of the provisions of the NSCA and the Regulations. 
Regulatory document REGDOC-1.6.1, Licence Application Guide: Nuclear Substances and Radiation 
Devices, sets out guidance for applicants in the preparation and submission of an application for a licence 
to carry out activities related to nuclear substances and radiation devices.  
REGDOC-1.6.1, Licence Application Guide: Nuclear Substances and Radiation Devices, version 2 
supersedes version 1, which was published in October 2015. The changes in version 2 do not result in 
new or increased obligations for licensees. 
Guidance contained in this document exists to inform the applicant, to elaborate further on requirements 
or to provide direction to licensees and applicants on how to meet requirements. It also provides more 
information about how CNSC staff evaluate specific problems or data during their review of licence 
applications. Licensees are expected to review and consider guidance; should they choose not to follow it, 
they should explain how their chosen alternate approach meets regulatory requirements.

A.3 
Public access to information 
Indicate whether any part of this application is subject to a request for exemption from the 
provisions of the Access to Information Act and the Privacy Act. A request for exemption 
should be made in writing to the CNSC detailing the applicant’s basis and reasons for such 
an exemption. 
A.4 
Name of applicant 
In this section, provide the legal name of the person, institution or corporation who will be 
referred to as the “licensee” on the issued licence. 
Indicate the name as it appears on the proof of legal status documentation, such as the proof 
of incorporation or sole proprietorship. 
An individual may be the applicant only if they will be solely responsible for the licence and 
are not a corporation or institution. 
The General Nuclear Safety and Control Regulations require notification to the CNSC in the 
event of a change in the applicant’s name during the valid period of the licence. 
A.5 
Eligibility of applicant 
The Nuclear Safety and Control Act (NSCA) allows for a “person” to be authorized to 
conduct licensed activities. In order to ensure the necessary accountability and responsibility, 
the applicant must be a “person”, which is a natural person (an individual), a government or 
public institution incorporated through enabling legislation or a corporate person (a 
corporation). General or limited partnerships are not eligible to be an Applicant since the 
CNSC cannot license a partnership under the NSCA, as they do not specifically meet the 
legal definition of a “person”. 
The applicant must indicate whether the application is from a natural person (individual/sole 
proprietorship), a public institution or a corporation (incorporated company). 
A sole proprietorship is where the business is owned and operated by one individual and 
where there is no legal distinction between the owner and the business. 
A public institution is any non-incorporated government department or agency, any non-
incorporated public institution or any other site which is set up under enabling legislation. 
An incorporated company is any incorporated business, institution or company where 
incorporation is carried out under federal or provincial authorization. 
Append information that establishes the applicant as a “person” for the purpose of this 
application. 
A.6 
Proof of legal status 
If the applicant is a corporation it needs to submit proof of incorporation and an official 
corporation profile report which sets out various information about the corporation, 
including: 
• 
corporation’s legal name  
• 
corporation number 
• 
date of incorporation 
• 
corporate status (showing it is still active) 
• 
registered office address 
• 
corporate history (providing details such as corporate amalgamations, corporate name 
changes) 
April 2017 
REGDOC-1.6.1, Licence Application Guide: Nuclear Substances and Radiation Devices 
 
 
7 
 
Federally incorporated companies under the Canada Business Corporations Act can obtain 
an official corporation profile report, referred to as a “Strategis Report”, from Industry 
Canada. For provincially incorporated corporations, similar corporation profile reports are 
available. For more information, contact the provincial department where the corporation 
was registered. 
If the corporation number has changed from the one printed on the valid CNSC licence, then 
the applicant must request authorization to transfer the existing licence by completing a 
licence transfer form. The completed form may be submitted to the CNSC by mail or by 
email at cnsc.forms-formulaires.ccsn@canada.ca. 
The General Nuclear Safety and Control Regulations require notification to the CNSC in the 
event of a change in the applicant’s legal status during the valid period of the licence. 
If the applicant is a public institution, specify the name of the enabling legislation (act) under 
which the institution was created. 
A.7 
Financial contact person 
Provide the name and contact information of the person to be contacted regarding payment 
of fees for the licence. 
Provide the business number (BN) identifier in the space provided. The BN identifier is 
different from the corporation number and is assigned to each business or other entity by the 
Canada Revenue Agency (CRA). 
A.8 
Financial guarantees 
The NSCA allows for the Commission or designated officers to request a financial 
guarantee. A financial guarantee assures there will be sufficient funds available for the safe 
termination of licensed activities. 
For new applications, this section does not apply.  
For renewal of an existing CNSC licence, please include a copy of the receipt for the most 
recent payment of the financial guarantee contribution required for this licence, if any. 
For public institutions, the financial guarantee requirement is covered through the conditions 
noted on the applicant authority form. 
A.9 
Description of the proposed licence 
Indicate which use types are the subject of this application. If using this application to apply 
for more than one use type, please indicate all that apply. Appendix B contains a list of use 
types with risk rankings. 
6. 
Part B – Purpose of the proposed licence 
In this section, identify the proposed activities and the locations which will be associated with the 
licensed activities of the nuclear substances and radiation devices. Refer to the NSCA for all 
activities that require a licence. Also, provide details about the nuclear substances and radiation 
devices that are to be licensed. List the nuclear substances under the following categories: unsealed, 
sealed, and radiation devices. All quantities should be expressed in SI units. The base is Becquerels.

Provide the mailing address, if it is different than the head office address, including the 
complete street name and number, and rural route number if appropriate, city, province or 
territory, and postal code. 
If no address is provided here, a licence issued in response to the application will be mailed 
to the head office address. A post office box is acceptable as a mailing address. 
Licensees must notify the CNSC within 15 days of any changes to this information. 
B.3 
Applicant authority (member of senior management or owner) 
Complete and sign the appropriate applicant authority form. There are separate forms for 
public institutions, incorporated companies and sole proprietorships. These forms are part of 
the application form package and can be found on the CNSC website. 
 
Regulations require that the licensee notify the CNSC within 15 days of a 
change in the applicant authority. 
A member of senior management must sign to certify that they have been designated as the 
applicant authority and to acknowledge that the designated person’s signature binds the 
applicant. Provide the name, title, address, email address and telephone number of the 
individual who signed the application as the applicant authority. 
The applicant authority understands that all statements and representations made in this 
application and on supplementary pages are binding on the applicant. The applicant authority 
also acknowledges that they have full legal and financial responsibility for the licence. 
The appropriate applicant authority form must be completed in full and include a clear 
photocopy of a current and valid government issued identification bearing the image and 
signature of the person designated as the applicant authority. 
 
A provincial health card or a social insurance card is not an acceptable form 
of government-issued identification.

REGDOC-1.6.1, Licence Application Guide: Nuclear Substances and Radiation Devices 
 
 
15 
 
 
Do not submit information containing social insurance numbers.  
 
D.2.3 The applicant must append its policy for informing in writing NEWs as well as the 
procedures used to provide specific instructions to them. 
The General Nuclear Safety and Control Regulations and the Radiation Protection 
Regulations require that NEWs be notified in writing of their status as NEWs and all 
associated implications. These include the risks related to the radiation to which NEWs may 
be exposed, applicable effective dose limits, typical dose levels received and the NEWs’ 
rights and obligations as specified by the Radiation Protection Regulations. Applicants must 
also include the information provided to NEWs regarding the rights and obligations of 
pregnant nuclear energy workers. 
A licensee must obtain written acknowledgement from each NEW that this information has 
been received. A sample form that may be used to inform workers of their NEW status can 
be found in appendix D. 
For the criteria to designate workers as NEWs, refer to the Radiation Protection Regulations. 
D.3  
Worker training and authorization 
Append a detailed description of the applicant’s proposed/existing radiation safety training 
program for each job category. 
Workers should not be authorized to work with nuclear substances or radiation devices until 
they have successfully completed appropriate training. 
Retraining should be given following any significant change in their work. Periodic refresher 
training is also recommended. 
It should not be assumed that radiation safety training obtained by workers in prior 
occupations or academic certification is adequate for an applicant’s operations. As a 
minimum, training should be site-specific, task-specific and tailored to the education, 
background and practical needs of each trainee. 
In addition, to promote a good safety culture, it is recommended that a licensee’s basic 
radiation safety training be extended to auxiliary personnel (e.g., clerical, janitorial, 
maintenance, security). 
An example of a training record can be found in appendix E. 
D.4  
Ascertaining and recording doses to workers 
D.4.1  Append a copy of the procedures for ascertaining and recording the radiation dose received 
by all workers as a result of licensed activities (i.e. alpha, beta, gamma and neutron). 
The applicant must include information regarding external and internal radiation monitoring 
programs to be used for the proposed licensed activity. For external monitoring, this may 
include information for whole body, skin, extremity and lens of the eye monitoring. For 
internal monitoring, this may include information on urine bioassay, thyroid bioassay or 
other measurements of internal intakes. 
If a dosimetry service is required to be used, identify the name of the CNSC licensed 
dosimetry service provider that will be used for any and all monitoring of workers.

16 
 
D.4.3 For renewals, append a summary of the annual radiation doses for all of the licensee’s 
monitored workers. For groups of monitored workers who have significantly different 
exposure levels, the summaries should be grouped by similar job types, types of exposure, 
nuclear substances and radiation devices used and/or work location. 
Do not include the dose result information obtained from the dosimetry service provider. 
This information contains dose results for specifically named persons and is considered 
personal medical information and must be kept private in accordance with the Personal 
Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act. 
 
Do not submit information containing social insurance numbers.  
 
Please include the summary chart of doses to workers from the most recent Annual 
Compliance Report (ACR). 
As specified in the Radiation Protection Regulations, identify the job positions whose 
recorded radiation dose is likely to exceed 5.0 mSv per year of whole body dose. 
The CNSC has prepared guidance documents regarding ascertaining and recording of 
radiation doses to individuals. Workers must be either monitored directly or by estimation of 
doses based on workplace monitoring. 
D.5  
Action levels 
Action levels are designed to alert licensees before regulatory limits are reached. In section 6 
of the Radiation Protection Regulations, an action level is defined as a “specific dose of 
radiation or other parameter that, if reached, may indicate a loss of control on the part of the 
licensee’s radiation protection program and triggers a requirement for specific action to be 
taken.” 
Action levels are required to be established for industrial radiography and logging sealed 
sources licences (use types 812 and 816); however, the CNSC strongly encourages all 
applicants to provide action levels in order to manage their radiation protection programs. 
Action levels should be based on the average in the industry. 
If action levels are a component of the radiation protection program, they should be 
identified as part of the application. If appropriate, they may be referred to in a licence. 
When a licensee becomes aware that an action level referred to in a licence has been 
reached, the licensee is obligated to comply with the related licence conditions and the 
Radiation Protection Regulations by investigating, taking corrective action and notifying the 
CNSC. 
D.6 
Control of radioactive contamination (where unsealed materials are used or stored) 
D.6.1 Append the policy and procedures for maintaining contamination control. 
Conditions of a licence typically require that removable contamination does not exceed 
radionuclide-specific limits on accessible surfaces in occupational and public areas. 
For control areas, removable surface-contamination limit criteria averaging over an area not 
exceeding 100 cm2 are as follows: 
• 
3.0 Bq/cm2 for Class A radionuclides, which are typically long-lived and emit alpha 
radiation  
April 2017 
REGDOC-1.6.1, Licence Application Guide: Nuclear Substances and Radiation Devices

gamma radiation 
• 
300 Bq/cm2 for Class C radionuclides, which are typically short-lived and emit beta or 
gamma radiation 
For supervised public areas and for decommissioning, removable surface-contamination 
limit criteria averaging over an area not exceeding 100 cm2 are as follows: 
• 
0.3 Bq/cm2 for Class A radionuclides  
• 
3.0 Bq/cm2 for Class B radionuclides 
• 
30 Bq/cm2 for Class C radionuclides 
See Appendix BB for additional guidance for the procedures to be appended. 
The applicant may request other contamination limits in accordance with the conditional 
clearance levels as provided in the Nuclear Substances and Radiation Devices Regulations. 
D.6.2 Append the procedures for monitoring contamination where unsealed nuclear substances are 
used or stored. Describe the measures to be taken if contamination limits are exceeded. 
Information should be provided on the monitoring protocols to be used, including 
frequencies of monitoring, for all areas where unsealed nuclear substances are used or 
stored. Applicants should classify areas to be monitored based on the potential risk for 
contamination and implement monitoring protocols that reflect this risk for each type of 
area. 
Applicants should demonstrate that there is sufficient detection instrumentation to monitor 
contamination to the levels provided above for the nuclear substances to be used or stored 
under the proposed licence. 
An example of a contamination monitoring results log can be found in appendix W. 
D.7  
Radiation detection instruments 
D.7.1 List all radiation detection and measuring instruments, including the type of instrument, its 
manufacturer, model, serial number and energy range and intended use. If the instrument is 
used for contamination monitoring, include the sensitivity of the instrument to detect nuclear 
substances typically used. In addition, include the last calibration date for all survey meters 
that will be used as part of the radiation safety program. 
Contamination meters need to be provided wherever there are unsealed nuclear substances 
other than S-35, C-14 and H-3. 
The CNSC strongly recommends licensees have a calibrated survey meter at all sites of 
licensed activity, including for every fixed or portable gauge location. Licensees should 
ensure that the survey meter is functioning properly by performing a pre-operational check. 
This may include a battery check, a response check, a high voltage check and confirmation 
of the calibration date. 
Under section 20 of the Nuclear Substances and Radiation Devices Regulations, no person 
shall use a survey meter unless it has been calibrated within the last 12 months. 
The CNSC has prepared information regarding the regulatory expectations for the calibration 
of survey meters and the applicant will confirm that this calibration will be carried out in 
accordance with CNSC expectations, as described in appendix Z.

must conduct leak tests on sealed sources containing 50 MBq or more of a nuclear substance 
(including those in radiation devices) or on a nuclear substance used as shielding 
(e.g., depleted uranium shields), using instruments and procedures that enable the detection 
of a leakage of 200 Bq. Section 18 also prescribes the frequency of testing and corrective 
actions to be taken if a leak is detected that exceeds this limit. 
The CNSC has prepared information on regulatory expectations for the leak testing of sealed 
sources and the applicant will confirm that this leak testing will be carried out in accordance 
with CNSC expectations, as included as appendix AA. 
D.9 
Access control and security 
D.9.1 Append the policy and procedures that outline the process for restricting access to nuclear 
substances and radiation devices to authorized and trained persons. 
Access is to be controlled from the time of acquisition until transfer or disposal. When not in 
use or not under the direct supervision and control of an authorized person, nuclear 
substances and radiation devices should be in a locked area, room, enclosure or vehicle. 
More information on access control and security of sealed sources may be found in 
REGDOC-2.12.3, Security of Nuclear Substances: Sealed Sources. Applicants who possess 
sealed sources will have to demonstrate how they will meet this document’s requirements.

In this part of the application (which is to be completed as applicable), provide the information 
specific to the use type being applied for. 
E.1 
Nuclear medicine and human research studies (use types 862, 872 and 875) 
E.1.1 
Medical practitioner: 
A physician acting as the medical practitioner must be qualified under provincial law to 
provide the medical supervision encompassed by the activities of the licence for which the 
application is made. When submitting an application for any activities involving nuclear 
medicine or human research, the person who will be acting as the medical practitioner must 
supply their name and contact details, provincial registration number and sign the declaration 
that they are qualified pursuant to s.16 of the Nuclear Substances and Radiation Devices 
Regulations. 
If there is more than one medical practitioner, provide a separate form for each. 
E.2 
Therapeutic nuclear medicine (use type 872) 
E.2.1 
Administration of nuclear medicine therapy doses: 
Append the policy and procedures for delivering radiation doses to patients for therapeutic 
reasons during the activities to be licensed, including: 
• 
the preparations to be undertaken prior to administering nuclear substances 
• 
the proposed manner of administering nuclear substances 
April 2017 
REGDOC-1.6.1, Licence Application Guide: Nuclear Substances and Radiation Devices 
 
 
26 
 
• 
the precautions to be followed after administering the nuclear substance 
• 
method for controlling radiation exposures of patients and non-patients 
• 
whether doses are administered on in-patient or out-patient basis 
A specific procedure must be submitted for each nuclear substance authorized by the 
therapeutic licence. 
All policies and procedures should demonstrate that the effective dose limits set out in the 
Radiation Protection Regulations will be met during the proposed activity. These procedures 
should also recognize the challenges associated with the discharge of materials and fluids 
from the treated patient. 
For patients treated with nuclear substances other than iodine-131, the associated safety 
requirements will depend upon the characteristics (e.g., type of emissions, biological 
half-life) of the nuclear substances used and other factors such as the routes of excretion. 
The licensee must have procedures for the care and management of patients who are 
deceased following internal administration or implantation of therapeutic nuclear substances, 
including policies for cremation or other disposition of the body. 
E.2.2 
Instructions to caregivers: 
Append the precautionary instructions that are to be given to persons who will care for a 
patient who has undergone nuclear medicine therapy. Provide instructions for all potential 
caregivers such as medical professionals, hospital workers and persons who may provide 
extended-care and home-care services. 
Good hygiene practices, infection control measures and universal precautions are typically 
sufficient to address most hazards associated with caring for a person who has undergone 
nuclear medicine therapy. However, special precautions are usually necessary to control the 
spread of radioactive contamination due to the excretions of nuclear medicine patients. 
E.2.3 
Instructions to patients of nuclear medicine therapy and their families: 
Append the precautionary instructions that are to be given to patients and their family 
members who have recently received nuclear medicine therapy in order to control 
radioactive contamination effects and radiation exposures to others. The proposed 
precautionary measures should take into account the radiation exposure limit that, typically, 
is set as a condition for the patient’s release from the hospital or treatment facility. 
The precautionary instructions must include information on any requirements, restrictions or 
prohibitions for the management of the patient if they become deceased after internal 
administration or implantation of the therapeutic nuclear substance. This should include 
information on possible retrieval of implants or restrictions for cremation of remains. 
E.2.4 
Release of patients: 
Append the policy and procedures for determining when patients that have received nuclear 
medicine therapy must be isolated and when they may be released from isolation. Propose 
the patient’s radiation activity level, that is to be used to determine when the patient must be 
isolated from other patients, as well as the limit below which no further precautions for 
radiation protection purposes will be required. 
Recommendations concerning isolation or release of patients treated with iodine-131 are: 
• 
if the activity remaining in the patient after treatment is less than 300 MBq and the 
approximate radiation dose rate at 2 m is less than 4 µSv/h, no hospitalization and only 
minimal precautions are required 
April 2017 
REGDOC-1.6.1, Licence Application Guide: Nuclear Substances and Radiation Devices 
 
 
27 
 
• 
if the activity remaining in the patient after treatment is less than 1,100 MBq and the 
approximate radiation dose rate at 2 m is less than 16 µSv/h, precautions should be taken 
whether the patient is hospitalized or released 
• 
if the activity remaining in the patient after treatment is greater than 1,100 MBq and the 
approximate radiation dose rate at 2 m exceeds 16 µSv/h, the patient should be isolated 
in the hospital and strict precautions implemented to limit the exposure of other persons 
E.2.5 
Assignment of nuclear medicine therapy rooms: 
Append the procedures used to assure that patients undergoing nuclear therapy with iodine-
131 will be assigned to a specifically designated private room with a private washroom. 
Typically, access to such rooms should be restricted, the flooring should be sealed against 
contamination and easy to decontaminate, and radiation warning signs and the name of an 
emergency contact person should be clearly posted. 
The radiation dose rate in an occupied area adjacent to a room occupied by a patient who is 
undergoing or who has undergone radiation therapy must not exceed regulatory limits and a 
patient who has not received nuclear therapy should not receive a radiation dose in excess of 
500 µSv during a hospital stay. 
E.2.6 
Decontamination and reuse of treatment rooms: 
Append the procedures for returning rooms that have been used for nuclear medicine therapy 
to a condition where they can be safely released for other purposes. 
Any licence issued by the CNSC in response to an application for a licence to conduct 
nuclear medicine therapy will include decontamination limits that must be met before 
nuclear medicine therapy treatment rooms can be released. Accordingly, the applicant’s 
proposed procedures and criteria for decontaminating rooms used for nuclear medicine 
therapy should assure compliance with the anticipated licence limits.  
For Class A, B and C nuclear substances (referred to in appendix Y), the relevant surface 
contamination limits, expressed in terms of removable surface contamination averaged over 
an area not exceeding 100 cm2, are as follows: 
• 
0.3 Bq/cm2 for all Class A nuclear substances, which are typically relatively long-lived 
and emit alpha radiation 
• 
3 Bq/cm2 for all Class B nuclear substances, which are typically relatively long-lived 
and emit beta or gamma radiation 
• 
30 Bq/cm2 for all Class C nuclear substances, which are typically short-lived and emit 
beta or gamma radiation 
See appendix BB for additional guidance for the creation of the procedures to be appended. 
E.2.7 
Medical emergencies: 
Provide a copy of the proposed policy and procedures for dealing with medical emergencies 
that involve patients treated with nuclear substances during the activities to be licensed. 
Include basic procedures that address requirements for emergency surgery, the death of a 
therapy patient, the availability of emergency supplies and the role of the RSO or RSO’s 
delegate. 
As noted in E.2.1, the licensee must have procedures for the care and management of 
patients who are deceased following internal administration or implantation of therapeutic 
nuclear substances, including policies for cremation or other disposition of the body. 
The CNSC recommends that the above procedures include a “first response” provision to 
make emergency care workers aware of the nature of the emergency and the associated

and details about the workers who implement and supervise the program, as well as workers 
who handle packages containing nuclear substances, the radiation dose monitoring program 
and nuclear substance inventory. 
The radiation safety program components described in this guide do not prevent alternative 
proposals being made by the applicants to the CNSC but any proposed radiation safety 
program should appropriately reflect the complexities and hazards of the activities described 
in a licensee’s application. In addition, as the licensee is ultimately responsible for radiation 
safety related to all activities authorized by the licence, an effective radiation safety program 
must have the support, commitment and participation of management and staff. 
E.6.1

well-shielded and ventilated area until its disposal. 
Append the policy and procedures for housing and waste disposal for animals treated with 
iodine-131. 
E.7.5 
Animals injected with technetium-99m: 
Technetium-99m has a half-life of six hours. The General Nuclear Safety and Control 
Regulations prescribe that measures to reduce the level of contamination in a place may be 
taken by a licensee in a manner appropriate for the circumstances and in accordance with the 
NSCA. In this case, it may be more reasonable from an ALARA perspective to secure the 
area and let the radioisotope decay to minimal levels. Therefore, before the decontamination 
process is started, a licensee may secure an area contaminated with technetium-99m for 48 
hours; this should allow this radiopharmaceutical to decay to background radiation 
(depending on what level of activity the radiopharmaceutical started out with). 
Append the policy and procedures used when dealing with animals that have been injected 
with technetium-99m. 
E.7.6 
Monitoring and release of animal housing: 
Append the policy and procedures that confirm that the housing for animals treated with 
veterinary nuclear medicine will not be used for any other purpose until the level of 
radioactive contamination meets criteria for release or re-use. 
All areas of animal housing should be monitored, cleaned, decontaminated and 
decommissioned, if necessary, before being reoccupied. Access to the area is restricted until 
the area has been decommissioned. 
If the subsequent animal occupying the housing is undergoing treatment with 
radiopharmaceuticals, the housing should meet the contamination monitoring limits for work 
surfaces. If the housing is released for non-radioactive use or if the housing is to be 
subsequently occupied by an animal not subject to related diagnosis or receiving radioactive 
therapy, the housing must meet the decommissioning requirements specified in the licence. 
The radioactive contamination level must be reduced sufficiently so that it will not increase a 
person's effective dose by 500 µSv or more per year in excess of background radiation. 
E.7.7

E.8.3 
Installation and dismounting of fixed gauges: 
Append the policy and procedures for installing and/or dismounting fixed gauges. The 
procedures must be specific to each model of radiation device to be installed or dismounted. 
If the applicant does not intend to install or dismount gauges, provide a statement to that 
effect. 
Documented procedures are required. Specific controls include the following: 
• 
installation is to be conducted only by workers who have successfully completed 
appropriate training (a licence application should include details on training in radiation 
detection instruments and fixed gauge installation)  
• 
workers must be properly authorized to perform this function  
• 
when installing a fixed gauge, the shutter of the device is to be closed and padlocked 
before any work begins; the closed status of the shutter is to be verified by noting the 
appropriate decrease in the gamma survey meter reading  
• 
a safe work permit is to be obtained as authorization to install or dismount fixed gauges 
• 
a calibrated survey meter is to be available at all times during the operation  
• 
the source holder is to be locked in the off position during mounting/dismounting 
operations 
• 
radiation intensities around the gauge are to be measured and recorded with the shutter 
in both the open and closed position, using at least four compass points on two 
perpendicular planes at the external surfaces and at 30 cm from the external surface  
• 
occupancy evaluation is to be conducted to decide whether additional shielding and/or 
personnel monitoring is required  
• 
permanent radiation warning signs are to be posted immediately upon completion of the 
gauge installation  
E.8.4 
Operation of insertion-type fixed gauges: 
Append the policy and procedures to handle insertion-type fixed gauges. If the applicant 
does not have insertion-type fixed gauges, provide a statement to that effect. 
To minimize the possibility of inadvertent and unnecessary exposure, procedures must be 
documented and provided to maintenance workers and others of the gauge’s isolation 
requirements. Specific controls are required. 
For the protection of workers, most nuclear gauging devices are designed with built-in safety 
features. However, there is a type of fixed gauge that is typically mounted on the outside of a 
vessel and is connected through a well in that vessel. This type of fixed gauge does not 
provide the same degree of safety as a standard fixed gauge. 
The operation of this type of fixed gauge requires that the source be taken out of its source 
holder and positioned at a specific location in the well. At this point, the amount of shielding 
between the source holder and the inside of the vessel is minimal. Therefore, insertion of the 
source into the well is to be done as rapidly as possible to minimize exposure to workers. 
There may also be a radiation hazard if the source is extended into the well and the vessel is 
not full. Personnel monitoring of radiation dose rates may be required during this type of 
installation.

Appendix C: Qualifications and Duties of the Radiation Safety Officer 
Radiation Safety Officers (RSOs) are specialists who, typically, provide day-to-day administration and 
control of radiation safety programs on behalf of their employers. Thus, the necessary competence in terms 
of educational training and practical experience that is required of an RSO in a particular situation will vary 
according to the responsibilities assigned to the RSO and the magnitude, complexity or diversity of the 
employer’s use of nuclear substances. Competence in radiation safety matters may be gained by completion 
of classroom instruction in radiation safety, relevant work experience or any appropriate combination of 
formal training and practical experience. 
Typically, RSOs who are assigned lead responsibility to ensure radiation safety should have relevant, 
practical work experience. RSOs that handle packages containing open-source radioisotopes should 
understand methods and technology to control, use, handle, store and transfer the nuclear substances, and to 
monitor and control radioactive contamination, radiation fields and radiation exposures. They should also 
understand pertinent regulatory processes and legislation. These may include the licensing process; 
conditions of the licences issued to the licensee by the CNSC, the Nuclear Safety and Control Act and its 
regulations; and pertinent CNSC regulatory guidance documents. 
Licensees are reminded that pursuant to section 15 of the General Nuclear Safety and Control Regulations 
that the CNSC must be notified within 15 days of any change of RSO or the RSO’s contact information. 
To ensure radiation safety and compliance with regulatory requirements on behalf of management, the RSO 
may need to: 
1. monitor, advise and consult regarding issues related to the handling of nuclear substances and radiation 
devices in accordance with regulations and licence conditions. Communicate with all workers and 
management 
2. review requests for authorization to purchase or use nuclear substances and radiation devices in order to 
ensure that the radioactive material, the proposed handling and location of storage are acceptable and 
comply with the regulations and licence requirements  
3. assess the qualifications and competence of workers who will use nuclear substances and radiation 
devices to determine whether they can do so safely and in compliance with regulations and the licence 
4. ensure that workers who are required to use nuclear substances and radiation devices are adequately 
trained in radiation safety and radiation protection procedures. Authorize qualified workers to use 
nuclear substances or operate radiation devices. Ensure that workers whose duties may occasionally 
expose them to nuclear substances and radiation devices, such as cleaners, administration or other 
support staff, receive appropriate training in radiation safety  
5. designate workers as Nuclear Energy Workers in accordance with the regulations 
6. develop and implement programs to inspect and review licensed activities; locations of nuclear substance 
and radiation device storage; and the adequacy of worker training, safety procedures or the work 
environment. Implement remedial actions to correct any deficiencies identified 
7. initiate any revisions to procedures, changes to equipment/facilities and licence amendments required to 
ensure on an ongoing basis that the licensee’s operations, equipment and facilities comply with 
regulatory requirements 
8. design and implement, in accordance with regulatory requirements, appropriate personnel monitoring 
programs 
9. administer or control the distribution, use, and maintenance of personnel radiation monitoring devices 
and equipment, and the recording of results 
April 2017 
REGDOC-1.6.1, Licence Application Guide: Nuclear Substances and Radiation Devices 
 
 
45 
 
10. monitor the occupational radiation exposures received by workers by reviewing the records of exposures. 
Recommend measures to management to reduce these exposures in accordance with the ALARA 
principle of dose limitation 
11. investigate all reports of overexposures to ionizing radiation and of accidents and losses involving 
nuclear substances and radiation devices, determine pertinent facts or confirm events, and recommend 
appropriate actions to mitigate the consequences or to prevent recurrences. Ensure that the incidents and 
the results of related investigations are reported to the CNSC and other relevant authorities in accordance 
with the regulations and licence conditions 
12. assess the adequacy of survey programs that measure or control radiation fields and radioactive 
contamination during licensed activities 
13. ensure that sealed sources are leak tested and radiation-monitoring instruments are calibrated in 
accordance with the regulatory requirements 
14. coordinate or participate in emergency responses to accidents and incidents involving nuclear substances 
and radiation devices 
15. ensure that all records and reports that are required by the conditions of the licence and the regulations 
are prepared, maintained and submitted as required

Appendix G: Principles for Applying ALARA to Industrial Radiography 
• 
Ensure radiography locations are posted with radiation warning signs or barriers to ensure 
compliance with dose-rate restrictions in your licence and the CNSC regulations. 
• 
Post signs at boundaries to inform others of radiography in progress. Ensure that all unauthorized 
personnel are out of the radiography area prior to commencing and maintain careful surveillance of 
the restricted area to ensure no other unauthorized personnel enter the area. 
• 
Utilize tungsten collimators wherever possible or where applicable. Collimators should be positioned 
in such a manner so that the beam of radiation is directed away from personnel. 
• 
Source guide tubes should be positioned when possible to take advantage of any shielding offered by 
surrounding components. 
• 
Radiography personnel shall position themselves as far as possible from the exposed source. The 
distance shall be governed by the radiographer’s ability to maintain surveillance over the high 
radiation area. 
• 
Radiography personnel shall make use of any available shielding offered by the surrounding work 
environment. Maintain surveillance over the high radiation area. 
• 
The source should be exposed and retracted as quickly possible without exerting excessive force on 
the exposure device. 
• 
Radiographers shall always approach the exposure device from the rear with the radiation survey 
instrument in front of them. Survey shall be made 360 degrees around the device and 100 percent of 
the guide tube. 
• 
Report all deviations from good ALARA practices to the RSO or other management immediately. 
• 
RSO or supervisor performs periodic in-field observations to ensure ALARA practices are being 
implemented. These surveillances should be documented. 
• 
Radiography operation staffing should include two operators, if possible. More than two may be 
needed to control the boundaries to achieve ALARA commitments. 
• 
Radiography personnel shall understand their responsibilities and actions following a radiation 
incident to receive minimum exposure and prevent overexposures during emergency situations.

Appendix I: Instructions for the Preparation of  
an Emergency and Operating Procedures Manual 
This appendix is meant to assist new applicants in preparing an emergency and operating procedures (EOP) 
manual. An EOP manual must be submitted with an application for a nuclear substance and radiation devices 
licence for industrial radiography. Appendices G, H and J through P of this guide, inclusive, are intended as 
operational guidance and may be included in your EOP. The recommendations, suggestions and comments 
presented here are the results of the CNSC’s review of various manuals and do not necessarily represent all 
the material required in an EOP manual. The information requested is considered the minimum information 
required for an EOP manual. As an applicant or licensee, you are encouraged to include any additional 
information that you deem necessary for the safe use of nuclear substances in your operations. 
The EOP manual should note the date it was prepared (or revised), who prepared it and what equipment it 
covers. It should include in its introduction a list of supporting documentation to be included in its 
appendices (e.g., checklists, manufacturer's manuals). 
Material covered in the EOP should be divided into two sections: daily (or routine) operations and 
emergency procedures, both of which are required by the Nuclear Safety and Control Act and its regulations. 
I.1 
Daily (routine) operations  
This section should be supported by the manufacturer's operating instructions and the various checklists that 
would be used for day-to-day operations. These operations should be described in the chronological order in 
which they would occur, beginning with the collection of equipment at the shop and ending with the return of 
the equipment and submission of the required reports. 
The procedures should cover any operations required for a radiography job that lasts one day or longer, and 
must take into consideration the different operating processes of the types of exposure devices to be covered 
by this manual. 
These procedures would include equipment and document checks, preparation for shipment and daily 
inspection of equipment. 
An example of a daily checklist can be found in appendix J. 
Subsections of the daily operations manual should include: 
I.1.1 
Exposure devices: 
These must be labelled as required by regulations. The operator would have to ensure he/she has the 
corresponding operations manual. These items should be included in the daily operations checklist. 
I.1.2 
Radiation survey meters: 
For purposes of this manual, operators should be instructed to check batteries and calibration (calibration 
sticker). Survey meter function can be checked while performing the surface dose-rate survey of the 
exposure device. These items should be included in the daily operations checklist. 
I.1.3 
Dose control: 
A dose-control program must be documented and must be designed to prevent exposures that exceed the 
permissible limits. The program must therefore address dose and time factors and must also take into 
consideration the delays associated with TLD analysis. 
April 2017 
REGDOC-1.6.1, Licence Application Guide: Nuclear Substances and Radiation Devices 
 
 
52 
 
Action levels must be established, implemented and enforced by the licensee. 
I.1.4 
Safety equipment: 
All required safety equipment should be listed in the daily operations checklist. 
I.1.5 
Transportation of sources: 
Preparation of the exposure device (i.e., the transport package) and documents for transport must be 
described. These steps apply to all shipment/transport of nuclear substances, whether it is by private vehicle, 
company vehicle or commercial shipper. A checklist for packaging and transportation should be prepared. 
In addition, an appropriate package of documents must be prepared as described in the Transportation of 
Dangerous Goods Regulations or as directed by the equivalent level of safety permit. These documents must 
accompany the device while it is being transported. 
I.1.6 
Source-changing procedures: 
This part of operations requires that a source-change request and consent form (see appendix K) be 
completed and the work carried out only by authorized personnel. Manufacturer's procedures must be 
followed. After the new source has been inserted, a survey of the exposure device must be completed and the 
results recorded. Inventory sheets must be updated. 
I.1.7 
Leak tests: 
Instruction on how to perform a leak test should be included in this section. Leak tests must include analysis 
for the depleted uranium incorporated in the shielding body, if any, as well as for the nuclear substance 
source assembly. 
I.1.8 
Source storage enclosures: 
Permanent storage locations should not be a part of this manual; they are assessed as part of your initial 
licence application. The preparation and use of temporary locations should be described here. Instruction 
must be given on what to do should the storage site be used for more than 90 days in any calendar year (i.e., 
the CNSC must be notified to formalize the location as a long-term place of storage and records must be 
maintained at that storage location in accordance with the licence conditions). 
I.1.9 
Records: 
This section should include instruction as to what forms and records are to be completed and submitted by 
the operator. Samples of records must be included in your manual and referenced in the appropriate 
procedures. Following is a list of the various records that must be kept. Each item in the list has been 
designated [EOP] or [ADMIN] depending on whether they need to be kept in the EOP manual or on file for 
administrative purposes. 
• 
inventory, make, model number, serial number, the activity of the nuclear substance, date of procurement 
and disposal of both the sources and the exposure devices [ADMIN].  
o 
It is recommended that a sheet be prepared for each exposure device. The header should list device 
model number, serial number, location of storage and dates of procurement and disposal. The 
columns on the sheet should record the source information under headings for date of insertion, 
model number, serial number, isotope, activity, date activity was measured, date of removal, to 
whom the source was transferred and who performed the transfer.

I.1.10 Dosimeters: 
I.1.10.1 Direct reading dosimeters: 
These are commonly referred to as DRDs. For purposes of this manual, the operator should be instructed on: 
• 
the purpose of the DRD 
• 
when it must be worn 
• 
where on the body it must be worn 
• 
when readings are to be recorded and submitted  
• 
what must be done when a reading exceeds 2.0 mSv 
• 
any other limit specified by the applicant 
I.1.10.2 Thermoluminescent dosimetry: 
These are commonly referred to as TLDs. For purposes of this manual, the operator should be instructed on: 
• 
the purpose of the TLD 
• 
when it must be worn 
• 
where on the body it must be worn 
• 
when the TLD must be returned for reading 
• 
the fact that the TLD is to be worn by only one person 
• 
the fact that the TLD is only to be worn for the assigned period 
• 
storing the TLD away from sources of radiation 
• 
reporting requirements for lost TLD 
• 
reporting requirements if TLD is accidentally exposed to radiation while not being worn 
I.1.11 Radiation survey meter: 
For purposes of this manual, the operator should be instructed on: 
• 
steps to take before use (battery and calibration checks) 
• 
the ‘function check’ (this can be done while surveying the exposure device and observing that the survey 
meter is displaying the expected radiation reading) 
• 
when the survey meter is to be used 
• 
what to do when the survey meter malfunctions or fails the battery, calibration or function checks 
I.1.12 Radiation audible alarms: 
For purposes of this manual, the operator should be instructed on: 
• 
who must wear an audible alarm 
April 2017 
REGDOC-1.6.1, Licence Application Guide: Nuclear Substances and Radiation Devices 
 
 
54 
 
• 
when to wear the dosimeter 
• 
where on the body to wear the dosimeter 
• 
any battery and function checks to be performed 
• 
that it is not be used as a substitute for the survey meter 
• 
calibration requirements 
I.1.13 Operations: 
The operations subsection of this manual should include the following: 
• 
a description of the procedures for securing and barricading of the work area. It is recommended that a 
chart be prepared to be used by the operator which would show the distances for the 0.1 mSv/h barrier, 
based on the activity of the source and collimator to be used. Barrier placement must be confirmed with a 
survey meter with the source in the exposure position 
• 
a description of the formula and procedure to be used to ensure the doses described in the barrier area are 
not exceeded. To properly determine dose, the survey meter must be carried to the exposure device and 
the exposure device must be surveyed on all sides. 
o 
the formula is  
 
DOSE = DOSE RATE X TIME (OCCUPANCY) 
 
• 
steps to be taken to minimize exposure if the movement of personnel cannot be controlled. 
• 
use of a radiation survey meter to establish barriers and controlled areas to ensure the return of the source 
to the fully shielded position after each retraction of the source and to prepare the device for shipment 
I.1.14 Radiographer training: 
Training of the operator by the licensee on the exposure device to be used should be reviewed. 
Transportation of dangerous goods training requirements should be reviewed. 
Training of the operator by the licensee on the specific emergency procedures should be reviewed. 
All certified exposure device operators who transport nuclear substances, whether by company or private 
vehicle or a commercial shipper, are required by the the Packaging and Transport of Nuclear Substances 
Regulations, 2015 and Transport Canada’s Transportation of Dangerous Goods Regulations to hold a 
Training Certificate. 
Sub-Section 6.1(1) of the TDGR requires that no person shall handle, offer for transport or transport 
dangerous goods unless the person is a trained person or performing those activities under the direct 
supervision of a trained person. A trained person is defined in section 6.2 as someone who has received 
adequate training related to that person's assigned duties in the aspects of handling, offering for transport or 
transporting dangerous goods, and has been issued a Training Certificate for Class 7, Radioactive Materials. 
The training requirements for Class 7, Radioactive Materials should include all elements listed in section 6.2 
of the TDGR and emergency response procedures for transportation incidents and reporting of dangerous 
occurrences. 
A certified exposure device operator (CEDO) is a person who has successfully completed the CNSC’s 
certification program and is recognized by the CNSC as a CEDO by the issuance of a certified exposure 
device operator card. A CEDO may operate any type of radiographic exposure device in Canada. Certified 
exposure device operator cards, however, do not cover handling, offering for transport or transporting a 
radiographic exposure device, and therefore cannot be used as a training certificate for TDGR purposes. 
April 2017 
REGDOC-1.6.1, Licence Application Guide: Nuclear Substances and Radiation Devices 
 
 
55 
 
To complete the training requirements, a certificate of training must be issued by the employer. The 
certificate of training is valid for the period specified in the TDGR. 
The following list summarizes the requirements of the TDGR that relate to the offering for transport (and the 
transport itself) of radioactive materials.

I.1.15 Emergency procedures: 
There are two types of emergencies that must be addressed in this part of the manual. They are: 
• 
situations that occur during radiographic operations (“operational emergencies”) 
• 
those which occur during other phases (e.g., during transport, fire, theft, leaking source) 
Source retrievals may only be undertaken by those persons specifically trained. 
I.1.15.1   Operational Emergencies 
Responses to operational emergencies should be divided into three parts: 
Pre-retrieval steps: 
These include: 
• 
removal of all personnel from radiation area 
• 
resurvey area and move barriers (0.1 mSv/h) and establish control areas 
• 
contact appropriate authorities 
• 
ensure proper dosimetry worn  
• 
description of how to locate source position using a survey meter 
April 2017 
REGDOC-1.6.1, Licence Application Guide: Nuclear Substances and Radiation Devices 
 
 
56 
 
Specific retrieval steps: 
Once the source position is known a specific emergency procedure may be followed. Specific emergency 
procedures should not repeat the common pre-retrieval procedures. Some examples of emergency situations 
are: 
• 
loss or theft of source 
• 
fire 
• 
leaking source 
• 
transport (accident) 
The following emergency situations require specialized training: 
• 
cable drive exposure device emergencies 
• 
source disconnect 
• 
source misconnect 
• 
source jammed in guide tube 
• 
source jammed in collimator 
• 
source not fully retracted 
• 
source outside the exposure device 
• 
pneumatically operated exposure device emergencies 
Post-retrieval steps: 
These should include: 
• 
reporting requirements for all agencies involved (CNSC, Transport Canada, provincial authorities, etc.) 
• 
removal from service of all involved equipment 
• 
required equipment checks, leak tests, surveys, etc. 
• 
recording and reporting of all doses associated with the retrieval 
• 
preparation of an incident report (a standard form should be prepared) 
I.1.15.2   Non-operational emergencies 
Leaking sources: 
Dealing with sources leaking nuclear substance and/or contamination problems is beyond the scope and 
training of a certified exposure device operator. 
If contamination is suspected the operator should contact the RSO immediately. 
Survey meters should not be used for contamination checks. 
Transport incidents: 
For exposure devices involved in transport accidents, procedures must include directions on who to call (i.e., 
RSO, CNSC duty officer, CANUTEC, etc.) and in what order in accordance with the Transportation of 
Dangerous Goods Regulations. 
The first instruction should be to attend to any injuries. If possible, remove injured persons from radiation 
areas. 
April 2017 
REGDOC-1.6.1, Licence Application Guide: Nuclear Substances and Radiation Devices 
 
 
57 
 
If the exposure device transport compartment is not damaged, it is safe to assume the exposure device has not 
been damaged. A survey should be performed as soon as possible to confirm this; radiation barriers and 
control areas should then be established. 
If the transport compartment is damaged and a survey cannot be performed, barriers should be set using the 
worse-case scenario of the source being fully exposed. 
Sources involved in a fire: 
Firefighting personnel should be informed of the possible hazard and its location and, when it is possible, 
monitor the radiation dose rates. 
After the fire, barricade the area, perform a detailed survey of the exposure device and take the appropriate 
actions. Equipment involved in the fire must not be used until it is leak tested and proper operation is 
confirmed by persons authorized to do so. 
Lost source: 
The loss of a source must be immediately reported to the CNSC in accordance with the Nuclear Safety and 
Control Act and its regulations.

Appendix Z: Regulatory Expectations for Calibration of Survey Meters 
Z.1 
Introduction 
CNSC regulations require radiation survey meters to be calibrated, in order to assure persons using the 
survey meter that the unit is functioning properly and that the readings obtained are representative of the 
actual conditions. 
Appendix Z outlines the CNSC’s expectations for applicants and licensees to meet regulatory requirements 
with respect to the calibration of survey meters. 
Nothing in this appendix shall be construed to imply that the CNSC authorizes, certifies or licences persons 
to conduct survey meter calibrations. It is the responsibility of the licensee to ensure that any person 
conducting a survey meter calibration on their behalf can do so in accordance with CNSC regulatory 
requirements and the expectations outlined in this document. 
Z.2 
Regulatory basis 
The regulatory requirement to have a calibrated survey meter is specified in section 20 of the Nuclear 
Substances and Radiation Devices Regulations and in sub-section 18(2) of the Class II Nuclear Facilities 
and Prescribed Equipment Regulations: 
“No person shall use, for the purpose of the Act, the regulations made under the Act or an order or a licence, 
a radiation survey meter that has not been calibrated within the 12 months preceding its use.” 
Z.3 
Program expectations for calibration of survey meters 
In order to ensure that the requirements of the regulations are met for having a survey meter that is 
calibrated, applicants and licensees must verify that the calibration is carried out in accordance with the 
following expectations. 
Z.3.1 
Calibration procedure documentation 
Before calibrating any specific make and model of survey meter, the person conducting the calibration shall 
have available for inspection and assessment a documented calibration procedure consisting of 
1. a general description of the method of calibration 
2. an identification and proof of verification of uncertainties associated with the jig, the source, attenuators, 
and decay correction which are associated with the total uncertainty of the calibration 
3. step-by-step procedures, preferably including manufacturers' manuals, to show that sufficient 
information about the survey meter is available to operate, to perform pre-calibration checks and to 
calibrate the specific survey meter 
Z.3.2 
Survey meter pre-calibration check 
Before calibration, each survey meter shall have a pre-calibration check that consists of: 
1. a battery check to ensure a satisfactory voltage can be maintained throughout the calibration 
2. a verification of operating voltage 
3. a comprehensive functional check on all ranges of the survey meter 
Z.3.3 
Physical and environmental expectations for jigs and survey meters 
1. The beam calibrator jig must be located in the following manner: 
2. to minimize radiation scatter and be at least 1 m from the floor, the ceiling, and from any wall. The 
distance between any scattering object and the source must be at least 0.5 m 
April 2017 
REGDOC-1.6.1, Licence Application Guide: Nuclear Substances and Radiation Devices 
 
 
83 
 
a. in an area free of interference from sources of ionizing radiation other than the calibration source 
b. in an area where electrostatic, electrical and magnetic fields and other non-ionizing radiation, such as 
radio frequency and microwave, will not affect instrument response 
3. The survey meter to be calibrated shall: 
a. be positioned on the jig to minimize bias due to geotropism, directional dependence, and non-
uniformity of the source radiation beam across and through the detector volume 
b. have any beta window or shield in the optimum position (normally closed) for best (i.e. flattest) 
energy response 
4. The uncertainty in calibration distance shall not be greater than 2% and shall be the arithmetic sum of the 
uncertainty of the jig distance scale, the uncertainty in physical placement and repositioning of the 
survey meter, the uncertainty in location of the source centre when on the jig, and the uncertainty of the 
centre of the sensitive volume of the survey meter detector 
5. The survey meter to be calibrated shall have achieved equilibrium with the temperature, pressure and 
humidity of the local calibration area. These parameters should be noted and shall be within the range as 
specified by the manufacturer of the survey meter. It is recommended that instruments are calibrated at 
about 20°C (68°F) and 101.3 kPa (1 atmosphere), or at the anticipated operational parameters. It should 
be noted that the response of some survey meters must be corrected for temperature and pressure. 
Therefore, where required, such corrections must be performed 
6. The calibration should be carried out where the level of background radiation is known and the 
appropriate corrections made to compensate for the contribution from this potential source of error. This 
is particularly important when measuring at the lowest ranges of energy 
Z.3.4 
Expectations for calibration sources 
It is preferable to use the same reference isotope as the manufacturer for the calibration source, especially if 
the manufacturer's specified energy response is to be assumed. Whatever isotope is used, the energy 
dependence of the dose rate response of the survey meter shall be known and shall be within 30 percent of 
the true dose rate over the energy spectrum of interest. 
The calibration source activity (or exposure rate) shall be known to an uncertainty of not greater than 
± 10 percent. This uncertainty shall include attenuators (used singly or in combination), if they are an integral 
part of the source assembly. A calibration source certificate shall be available for inspection, and as a 
minimum the source shall be implicitly traceable through a source supplier to a national or international 
standard. The calibration source activity shall be corrected for decay at a frequency to ensure its activity is 
within 1 percent of its current value. 
Z.3.5 
Expectations for survey meter calibration 
Each survey meter shall be calibrated up to its highest range or the 10 mSv/h range, whichever is lower. The 
manufacturer's recommended calibration method, if any, must be followed, and the calibration shall be 
verified at about 20 to 25 percent and 75 to 80 percent of the measurement of each range or decade. 
Measurement shall be recorded before and after any necessary (or preferred) calibration adjustments. A 
survey meter shall be considered to meet the criteria for being adequately calibrated when each observed 
measurement is within ±20 percent of the expected dose rate. 
Measurements above 10 mSv/h need not be calibrated, but each range shall be checked to ensure response 
and, as far as practicable, by decreasing calibration distance the appropriate increasing dose rate response 
shall be checked. 
Z.3.6 
Expectations for record completion 
Immediately following calibration the person completing the calibration must complete a calibration 
certificate, and complete and affix a durable calibration sticker, bearing the date of calibration, to the survey 
April 2017 
REGDOC-1.6.1, Licence Application Guide: Nuclear Substances and Radiation Devices 
 
 
84 
 
meter. The person conducting the calibration shall return the original certificate with the survey meter to the 
user. 
If a survey meter fails to meet the criteria for being adequately calibrated, the person conducting the 
calibration shall immediately notify the person who requested the calibration. 
If requested to do so, a person conducting the calibration may, if they are qualified through training or other 
certification, repair a survey meter before returning to the user. Subsequent to any repair which exceeds the 
manufacturer’s instructions for normal maintenance, a survey meter shall be recalibrated. 
Z.3.7 
Documentation of calibration 
In order to meet the requirements of section 20 of the Nuclear Substances and Radiation Devices 
Regulations, licensees must make available on request to the CNSC a document for each survey meter which 
includes the following information: 
1. licensee name and CNSC licence number  
2. survey meter make and model, including serial number of the detector unit and the probe used in the 
calibration, if appropriate 
3. the calibration source used, including isotope and activity 
4. the results of the pre-calibration checks, including: 
a. battery condition 
b. operating voltage 
c. temperature, pressure and humidity, at the time of calibration 
5. for each range used in the calibration 
a. the expected dose rate using the calibration device 
b. the observed dose rate on the survey meter, with units, including both pre and post calibration 
c. the calculated percent variance of the observed dose rate versus expected dose rate 
d. any notes of concerns or anomalies for that range 
6. any notes of anomalies or problems associated with the calibration of the survey meter in general 
7. the date of the calibration of the survey meter 
8. the name and signature of the person who conducted the calibration 
9. acknowledgement that the calibration was carried out in accordance with these requirements 
Z.4 
Maintenance of records 
The licensee shall retain a record of each survey meter calibration as required by the NSCA and regulations 
and shall retain those records for the period specified in the licence or the Regulations, as appropriate.

Appendix BB: Radioisotope Safety – Monitoring for Radioactive Contamination 
This appendix provides general guidance for monitoring and controlling radioactive contamination, and 
relating the monitoring results to the contamination limits specified in CNSC licences. The appendix also 
provides guidance on contamination monitoring instrument selection.  
Certain CNSC licences authorizing the use of unsealed nuclear substances contain a condition that states the 
regulatory criteria pertaining to radioactive contamination. This licence condition can be found in section 
BB.2.8 “Regulatory criteria for radioactive contamination”.  
The specified contamination criteria should be applied to all areas where unsealed nuclear substances are 
used/present, or have been used. Notwithstanding these limits, licensees should maintain levels of radioactive 
contamination as low as reasonably achievable (ALARA).  
BB.1 Elements of a contamination monitoring program  
BB.1.1 Method of measurement  
Radioactive contamination may be measured directly or indirectly. Direct measurement generally means the 
use of portable radiation detection instruments to detect both fixed and removable contamination. Direct 
measurement may be used when background radiation levels are negligible compared to licence criteria. 
Indirect measurement only detects removable contamination by means of a sampling program. 
BB.1.2 Instrument selection  
The ability of various radiation detection instruments to detect radioisotopes will vary by instrument and 
manufacturer. Guidance on the selection of instruments can be found in the section “Selection of 
contamination monitoring instruments”. For specific information on a particular model, contact the 
manufacturer.  
BB.2 Contamination monitoring  
BB.2.1  Purpose 
The locations selected for contamination monitoring should be numbered on a plan of the work area. These 
locations should include working surfaces (such as benches, countertops or fume hoods), storage areas, and 
non-working surfaces (such as floors, instruments and equipment, door handles, light switches, sink taps and 
telephones). Several random locations should also be monitored. Too rigid a set of locations may overlook 
problem areas. The list of locations should be reviewed at a sufficient frequency to determine whether the list 
is current or new locations should be added. 
BB.2.2 Instrument checks  
All instruments used for counting samples, such as liquid scintillation counters, well-type crystal gamma 
counters, gas-flow proportional counters, semiconductor gamma spectrometers and gamma cameras, should 
be routinely serviced according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Licensees must keep a record of the 
servicing with the date.  
Before monitoring for contamination, all instruments should be given operational checks as specified by the 
manufacturer; i.e., battery check, high-voltage check, response check and the background radiation level 
should be measured. Licensees must keep a record of the operational checks and background measurement. 
Similarly, the instruments should be used to measure the radiation from a standard such as a check source for 
every set of contamination monitoring measurements performed. The results of those measurements allow 
the determination of the instrument efficiency.  
April 2017 
REGDOC-1.6.1, Licence Application Guide: Nuclear Substances and Radiation Devices 
 
 
89 
 
Instruments that are not operating within the parameters of operational checks, or that show anomalous 
background, blank or standard measurements, should not be used until their proper operation can be verified. 
These instruments should be tagged indicating that they are out of service and should not be used until their 
proper operation can be verified.  
BB.2.3 Frequency of contamination monitoring  
Contamination monitoring frequencies, which should be at least weekly during periods of regular use, should 
conform to the requirements indicated in the licensee’s radiation protection program.   
When radioactive substances are not used for a prolonged period of time, contamination monitoring is not 
required, but such a period should be identified in the records.  
BB.2.4 Direct measurement of contamination using a portable meter  
Direct measurement instrument readings include both fixed and non-fixed contamination. Subsequently, a 
direct reading may be used to satisfy licence criteria for non-fixed contamination. 
BB.2.5 Indirect measurement of contamination with wipes  
Perform the following steps for indirect measurements:  
• 
Wipe each of the locations shown on the plan of the working area with a filter paper, wipe or cotton 
swab lightly moistened with alcohol or water. Use one numbered wipe per location. If contamination is 
found, the contaminated area shall be identified and decontaminated.  
• 
Wipe an area of 100 cm2. Using uniform and constant pressure, wipe the entire area. In situations where 
wipes of 100 cm2 areas are not feasible such as wipes of some equipment, light switches, etc., take note 
of the area of the surface wiped and ensure the appropriate conversion factor is applied.  
• 
If necessary, carefully dry the wipe to prevent loss of activity. Since the contamination may be absorbed 
into the wipe material, the use of a wetting agent may lead to a significant underestimate of alpha and 
low-energy beta contamination with some counting methods.  
• 
Count the wipes in a low-background area and record all results.  
• 
If the wipes are to be counted on a contamination meter, the wipe should be smaller than or equal to the 
sensitive area of the detector. Note that the geometry of the wipe material (flat like filter paper or round 
like a swab) may change results.  
• 
Clean any contaminated areas and monitor again. Record results before and after decontamination.  
BB.2.6 Decontamination  
Any area that is found to have non-fixed contamination exceeding the contamination criteria shall be cleaned 
and monitored again. If the area cannot be cleaned to meet those criteria, the contaminated area shall be 
sealed or shielded until the criteria are met. All non-fixed contamination should be removed if possible.  
Note: For short-lived radionuclides, the room or area may be posted and secured until the radioisotope 
decays.  
BB.2.7 Monitoring records  
Contamination monitoring records shall be available for inspection by CNSC staff. These records should 
include:  
• 
date of measurement  
• 
make and model of the instrument  
• 
monitoring locations  
April 2017

• 
contamination monitoring results in Bq/cm2 before and after decontamination, if applicable  
• 
results of operational checks and background measurements  
• 
standard measurement results  
• 
measured or predicted efficiency  
• 
instrument servicing records should be recorded and updated as necessary  
• 
demonstration that the chosen instrument and counting methods yield a minimum detectable activity 
below the applicable criteria 
BB.2.8 Regulatory criteria for radioactive contamination  
The licensee shall ensure that for nuclear substances listed in appendix Y: Classes of Nuclear Substances:  
• non-fixed contamination in all areas, rooms or enclosures where unsealed nuclear substances are 
used or stored does not exceed:  
o 3 Bq/cm2 for all Class A radionuclides  
o 30 Bq/cm2 for all Class B radionuclides  
o 300 Bq/cm2 for all Class C radionuclides, averaged over an area not exceeding 100 cm2  
• non-fixed contamination in all other areas does not exceed:  
o 0.3 Bq/cm2 for all Class A radionuclides  
o 3 Bq/cm2 for all Class B radionuclides  
o 30 Bq/cm2 for all Class C radionuclides, averaged over an area not exceeding 100 cm2  
BB.2.8.1 Relating measurement readings to regulatory criteria  
The readings from contamination meters can be related to regulatory criteria if the efficiency of the 
instrument for a specific nuclear substance is known. Instrument efficiencies for specific nuclear substances 
can be obtained from the manufacturer or determined using an appropriate standard of known activity. For a 
description of instrument efficiency, refer to section BB.2.11, Detector efficiency.   
For mixtures of nuclear substances, identify the isotope for which the detector has the lowest response at the 
applicable contamination limit.  
Using the following equation, calculate the measurement results in Bq/cm2  
Removable Activity = 
N-NB 
 
 
E x 60 x A x F 
Where: 
N 
= the total count rate in counts per minute (cpm) measured directly or on the wipe. 
NB = the normal background count rate (in cpm) from the portable survey instrument or the count rate 
(in cpm) from a blank sample using a benchtop instrument 
E 
= the instrument efficiency factor (expressed as a decimal, i.e. for 5 percent efficiency, E=0.05) for 
the radioisotope being measured. Consult the manufacturer or determine using a radioactive 
source with a known amount of activity in a counting geometry similar to that used when 
surveying for contamination. For more information, see section BB.2.11 
60 
= sec/min 
A 
= area wiped (not to exceed 100 cm2) or area of the detector in cm2 (for direct measurement)

F 
= the collection factor for the wipe (used only when calculating indirect wipe monitoring results). 
If F is not determined experimentally, a value of F=0.1 (i.e. 10%) shall be used. 
BB.2.9 Minimum detectable activity 
The minimum detectable activity (MDA) is defined as the minimum amount of activity in a sample that can 
be detected with a 5-percent probability of erroneously detecting radioactivity when none is present, and a 5-
percent probability of not detecting radioactivity when it is present. For any given system designed to count 
and quantify radioactivity, the MDA should be calculated for the most restrictive scenario (i.e., for the 
nuclide with the lowest detection efficiency and the most restrictive regulatory criterion). The units of the 
MDA (Bq, Bq/gr, Bq/cm2) should be the same as those expressed in the licence or regulatory criterion, as 
applicable. The MDA in Bq/cm2, can be calculated as follows: 
MDA (Bq/cm2) = 
2.71+4.66ට𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁×ൣ𝑇𝑇60
ൗ
൧
𝐸𝐸 × 𝑇𝑇 × 𝐴𝐴 ×𝐹𝐹 
 
Where the terms NB, E, A and F have the same meanings as the section above and 
T =  the counting time, in seconds, for indirect wipe monitoring, and is the instrument response time for 
direct measurements (or the actual time if performing scalar counting). The instrument response time 
will vary between instruments and is a parameter which can be selected by the user on some devices; 
e.g., via either software selection of the actual time or “fast/slow” switch set to predefined times 
specified in the user manual. Other instruments may auto-select the response time based on the count 
rate. Longer response times will improve the MDA, but the instrument shall stay stationary over each 
area for a period that is at least as long as the response time.  
Note: the efficiency, and hence the MDA of the instrument is highly dependent on the distance between the 
source and the detector. The MDA should be calculated for the distance at which the detector will be when 
monitoring. 
BB.2.10 
Selection of contamination monitoring instruments  
The MDA for a nuclear substance will depend on both the types and energies of radiation emitted by that 
nuclear substance and on the type of detector used. In general, there are three basic detector design 
considerations that will impact instrument sensitivity, and each of these parameters will have a different 
impact, depending upon the type and energy of radiation being detected:  
BB.2.10.1 Window thickness and composition 
Consideration should be given to whether the window density is small enough to allow the radiation emitted 
by source to enter the detector. This is critical for low-energy beta radiation and alpha radiation, which can 
be completely absorbed even by materials as thin as a sheet of paper. Note that some isotopes, such as H-3 or 
Ni-63, cannot be detected by most instruments, because the beta radiation they emit gets completely 
absorbed within the window. For such isotopes, indirect monitoring using liquid scintillation is generally the 
best choice.  
BB.2.10.2 Detector density 
Every radiation detector functions by detecting interactions between the radiation and a material within the 
detector. There are two broad classes of detectors: gas-filled detectors, and solid or liquid scintillators. Gas-
filled detectors, such as Geiger detectors and proportional counters, will generally work well for detecting 
alpha or beta radiation, since these types of radiation will cause interactions even in low-density materials. 
Conversely, gamma rays may readily pass through a low-density gas without interaction, especially at high 
energies. Solid scintillators, such as NaI detectors, are generally much better suited to detecting gamma

radiation. Thin crystal detectors are suitable for low-energy gamma emitters such as Tc-99m, while thicker 
detectors will enhance sensitivity for high-energy gammas such as those from Cs-137 or Co-60.  
BB.2.10.3  Detector output 
Every time radiation interacts with a detector, a tiny amount of energy is released within the detector. This 
energy is then converted into an electronic signal that can be measured. Some detectors, such as Geiger 
counters, produce uniform pulses which can be counted. Other systems, such as scintillators or proportional 
counters, may produce a signal that is proportional to the amount of energy released in the initial radiation 
interaction. This can be used to distinguish between different types of radiation or different energies of 
radiation of the same type. Such detectors are useful in applications where distinguishing between multiple 
different isotopes may be necessary.

*  Ion chambers are another major type of portable detector. These devices are intended for measurement of 
radiation dose rates rather than contamination. In general, they are poorly suited to contamination 
monitoring and should not be used for this purpose. 
** Nuclear substances that decay via emission of alpha or beta particles often also emit gamma rays. Many 
isotopes, especially high atomic number materials such as uranium and radium, may exist in equilibrium 
with the other isotopes in their “decay chain”, which in turn emit many different types and energies of 
radiation. When choosing a contamination monitor, it is important to consider exactly what types of 
radiation will be present. For example, positron emission tomography (PET) isotopes decay by the 
emission of a positron (beta+) which in turn produces two high-energy (511 keV) gamma rays. It is the 
gamma rays that are of primary importance in the use of these isotopes, and a thick crystal NaI scintillator 
will detect these gammas very efficiently. However, a thin window Geiger detector will detect the beta+ 
emissions even more efficiently, and will generally have a much lower background (NB) count-rate.

BB.2.11 
Detector efficiency: 
The detector efficiency depends upon:  
• 
the type of detector (ex: Geiger-Müller, NaI scintillation, plastic/organic scintillation, proportional 
counter…)  
• 
the detector size and shape  
• 
the distance from the detector to the radioactive material  
• 
the nuclear substance and the type of radiation measured (alpha, beta and gamma radiations and their 
energies)  
• 
the backscatter of radiation toward the detector  
• 
the absorption of the radiation before it reaches the detector (by air, by the material itself and by the 
detector covering) 
The detector efficiency can be determined by:  
1. Counting an appropriate standard source of known activity with your detector, in counts per second (cps) 
Efficiency = 
(detector count rate – background count rate) 
 
 
known activity of standard source 
2. Referring to the documentation supplied by the vendor for your specific nuclear substance(s). If not 
specified, by contacting the vendor for the required information.
