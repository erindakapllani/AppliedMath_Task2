Relevant legislation 
The following provisions of the Nuclear Safety and Control Act (NSCA) are relevant to this 
document: 
 
Section 2 defines the term nuclear energy worker (NEW). 
 
Section 27 states that licensees must keep dose records and retain them for a prescribed 
amount of time. 
The following provisions of the Radiation Protection Regulations (RPR) are relevant to this 
document: 
 
Subsection 5(1) requires every licensee to ascertain and record the magnitude of exposure to 
radon progeny of each person referred to in section 27 of the NSCA, as well as the effective 
dose and equivalent dose received by and committed to that person. 
 
Section 13 sets effective dose limits.  
 
Section 14 sets equivalent dose limits. 
 
Section 15 sets dose limits for persons participating in the control of an emergency. 
 
Subsection 24(2) states that licensees must maintain dose records for a period of 5 years after 
the day the information is collected.  
2. 
General Information 
2.1 
Effective dose limits 
The regulatory limits on effective dose apply to all sources of radiation exposure combined, that 
is, to sources external to the body and to sources within the body. 
Section 13 of the RPR sets out the effective dose limits to various persons. These persons are 
NEWs, pregnant NEWs, and persons who are not NEWs. Section 15 of the RPR sets out effective 
dose limits for persons participating in the control of emergencies.  
For each of these persons, the effective dose limits apply to the sum of: 
 
the effective dose received from sources of ionizing radiation outside the body 
 
the committed effective dose (CED) from radon and radon progeny, when taken into the body 
 
the CED from radionuclides (other than radon-222 and its progeny) taken into the body 
The total effective dose, as determined by the above summation method, is compared with the 
applicable effective dose limits, stipulated in sections 13 and 15 of the RPR, to determine 
compliance with those limits. 
2.2 
Equivalent dose limits 
Section 14 of the RPR sets out the equivalent dose limits to NEWs and any other person for the 
lens of the eye, skin, and hands and feet. Section 15 of the RPR sets out equivalent dose limits for 
persons participating in the control of emergencies. For each of these persons, the equivalent dose 
limits apply to the product, in sieverts, obtained by multiplying the absorbed dose by the 
weighting factor of a given type of radiation.

The equivalent dose, as determined by the method above, is compared with the applicable 
equivalent dose limits, stipulated in sections 14 and 15 of the RPR, to determine compliance with 
those limits. 
2.3 
Dosimetry methods 
This document refers to 3 general approaches to dosimetry: direct monitoring, indirect monitoring 
and dose modelling.  
Direct monitoring refers to personal dosimetry or individual monitoring. It includes the use of 
personal whole-body or extremity dosimeters, personal air samplers, as well as in vivo and in 
vitro bioassay measurements. Direct monitoring is the most accurate and preferred method to 
ascertain doses to workers.  
Indirect monitoring refers to workplace monitoring. It includes area gamma or neutron dose rate 
measurements and area air monitoring. Workers’ doses may be estimated by applying indirect 
monitoring results to their occupancy times.  
Dose modelling refers to estimating doses on the basis of a characterized source term, taking into 
account relevant parameters such as exposure time and geometry, shielding, type of radiation, or 
nuclear substance. It includes the application of published dose coefficients, is typically carried 
out by using software, and is generally prospective in nature. The sources of dose coefficients 
typically include those published by the International Commission on Radiological Protection 
(ICRP). It should be noted that the ICRP internal dose coefficients are being updated to 
incorporate the tissue weighting factors introduced in ICRP Publication 103, The 2007 
Recommendations of the International Commission on Radiological Protection [4]. However, the 
use of current ICRP dose coefficients remains acceptable at this time for the purposes of dose 
modelling.  
2.4 
Dosimetry services 
Section 8 of the RPR requires licensees to use a dosimetry service that is licensed by the CNSC to 
measure and monitor the doses of radiation received by and committed to NEWs who have a 
reasonable probability of receiving: 
 
an effective dose greater than 5 mSv in a 1-year dosimetry period, or 
 
an equivalent dose to the skin, or to the hands and feet, that is greater than 50 mSv in a 1-year 
dosimetry period  
This requirement ensures that doses are monitored with sufficient accuracy and precision. 
Requirements relating to licensed dosimetry services can be found in REGDOC-2.7.2, 
Volume II [2]. 
Guidance on determining when licensed dosimetry would be required can be found in 
REGDOC-2.7.1 [1]. 
2.5 
Dose records 
All data used to ascertain doses, reports generated as part of investigations, and documents 
associated with dose change requests (DCRs), including the investigation report, the DCR form 
and the CNSC approval letter, must be kept for the period of time prescribed in subsection 24(2) 
July 2021 
REGDOC-2.7.2, Dosimetry, Volume I: Ascertaining Occupational Dose 
 
4 
 
of the RPR. Such data should enable reasonable re-creation and checking of results from 
referenced input data. A clear method to identify workers and maintain dose records should be 
established. The identification, storage, protection, retrieval and disposition of records should be 
controlled. 
2.6 
National Dose Registry  
According to the RPR, if dose measurements are recorded by a licensed dosimetry service, dose 
records for NEWs are required to be submitted to the NDR along with specific personal 
information identified in the RPR.  
The NDR is a database owned and operated by Health Canada that tracks the lifetime dose history 
of registered individuals. The CNSC has a memorandum of understanding with Health Canada 
that sets out Health Canada’s responsibility to operate the registry, maintain the information 
required under the RPR and make that information available to the CNSC.1  
Upon request, Health Canada shares information from the NDR with the CNSC. This includes 
information on trends relating to dose data for facilities or groups of facilities; detailed dose 
information for individuals and licensees; and necessary information for the conduct of health 
studies, including epidemiological studies. Health Canada also informs the CNSC of any records 
indicating that a dose limit for a NEW has been exceeded. Prompt identification of such records 
allows the CNSC to act immediately to ensure that licensees have taken appropriate action as 
required by the RPR.  
A licensee may request a change to a dose record or changes to a group of dose records in the 
NDR. Part C describes the process for making changes to dose-related information filed with the 
NDR. 
2.7 
Characterization of radiological conditions 
A workplace hazard assessment should be carried out and documented. Consequently, the 
radiological conditions (e.g., facility layout, types of radionuclides and activities being 
undertaken) at a licensed facility or at a location where a licensed activity is being carried out 
should be characterized, documented, monitored, and updated in the event of changes that may 
impact doses to workers. Characterization of radiological conditions should provide a 
comprehensive description of radiation sources and the nature of radiation present in all work 
locations that may result in occupational exposure. The radiological conditions should be verified 
periodically and the documentation should be kept up to date. 
For sources of external exposure, radiological characterization should include: 
 
the radionuclides expected to be present at the workplace, as well as their half-life, progeny 
and relative abundances 
 
the radiation types and energies emitted by those radionuclides 
 
 
1 The NDR is a registry of occupational doses to Canadian workers. The NDR also includes doses received by 
foreign workers; however, these doses are not used for analyses of the NDR data. They are included so that 
dosimetry services can comply with section 19 of the RPR.

 
a description of radiation sources (e.g., physical form, geometry and applicable shielding 
information) 
If applicable, licensees should document the neutron energy spectrum at their workplace. This 
information should be used to select suitable methods for ascertaining occupational dose from 
neutron exposures. Generally, characterization of radiological conditions in a workplace provides 
important information to select appropriate types of dosimetry. 
For sources of internal exposure, the radiological characterization should provide a 
comprehensive description of the nature, extent and variability of surface contamination, airborne 
radioactivity and other potential sources of intakes, as appropriate, at all work locations. The 
radiological characterization should document default values and, where applicable, the following 
information, for all locations in a facility: 
 
the radionuclides expected to be present at the workplace, as well as their half-life, progeny 
and relative abundances 
 
the radiation types and energies emitted by those radionuclides 
 
their chemical forms and related respiratory tract clearance types 
 
the particle size (expressed as the activity median aerodynamic diameter, or AMAD), if 
applicable

Part A – External Exposure 
External dosimetry is the measurement of dose when radiation sources are outside the body. 
External dosimetry is concerned with radiation that can penetrate the dead layer of skin: photon, 
beta and neutron radiation. Since photons and betas result in charged particle interactions and 
neutrons interact through nuclear forces, their dosimetry and the methods for detecting them are 
substantially different.  
External exposure to radiation can be measured by direct monitoring. However, if the time and 
resources required for direct measurement outweigh the usefulness of that method, the exposure 
can be estimated. 
3. 
Operational Dose Quantities 
Operational dose quantities are defined in the International Commission on Radiation Units and 
Measurements (ICRU) Report 51, Quantities and Units in Radiation Protection Dosimetry [5], as 
a set of measurable quantities of external exposures that can be used to demonstrate compliance 
with regulatory dose limits. The following information is based on that report. 
3.1 
Ambient dose equivalent, H*(d) 
The ambient dose equivalent is used when area monitoring is used to ascertain external dose. For 
strongly penetrating radiation, a depth of 10 mm is used. For weakly penetrating radiation, depths 
of 0.07 mm for the skin and 3 mm for the lens of the eye are used. H*(d) represents the ambient 
dose equivalent, where (d) is the depth measured in millimetres. 
3.2 
Directional dose equivalent, H’(d, Ω)  
The directional dose equivalent is used when area monitoring is used to ascertain external dose. 
This operational quantity takes into consideration the specified direction of the radiation field, Ω. 
For strongly penetrating radiation, a depth of 10 mm is used. For weakly penetrating radiation, 
depths of 0.07 mm for the skin and 3 mm for the lens of the eye are used. H’(d, Ω) represents the 
directional dose equivalent, where d is the depth measured in millimetres.  
3.3 
Personal dose equivalent Hp(d)  
The personal dose equivalent is the operational quantity employed when direct (or individual) 
monitoring is used to ascertain external dose. For strongly penetrating radiation, a depth of 
10 mm is used. For weakly penetrating radiation, depths of 0.07 mm for the skin and 3 mm for 
the lens of the eye are used. Hp(d) represents the personal dose equivalent, where (d) is the depth 
measured in millimetres.

Direct Monitoring 
In order to ascertain external doses to workers, direct monitoring may be carried out using a 
personal dosimeter. Worker doses may be ascertained using dosimetry provided by a licensed 
dosimetry service. Alternatively, when licensed dosimetry is not required, doses may be 
ascertained by direct monitoring techniques specified in the licensee’s radiation protection 
program.  
Dosimeters are classified into 2 general categories:  
 
passive dosimeters, which produce a radiation-induced signal that is stored in the device (the 
dosimeter is then processed and the output is analyzed)  
 
active dosimeters, which produce a radiation-induced signal and display a direct reading of 
the detected dose or dose rate 
A typical passive dosimeter used to measure photon and beta radiation consists of a detector 
inserted into a holder. Dosimeters vary in their configuration. However, the detector contains the 
sensitive element(s) and the holder contains the filter(s). In a dosimeter that measures photon and 
beta radiation, it is mainly the filter/holder that permits the instrument to differentiate between the 
personal dose equivalent to the skin or eye (Hp(0.07) and Hp(3) respectively) and the personal 
dose equivalent to the whole body (Hp(10)). One part of the holder may have an open window (no 
filter or a very thin filter) to measure Hp(0.07), and the other part of the holder may have a thicker 
filter that allows for measurement of Hp(3) or Hp(10). The thicker filter or filters shield the 
low-energy photons and beta radiation, and allow only the more penetrating radiation to deposit 
energy. Some dosimeters have multiple filters of different thicknesses and compositions that 
allow them to discriminate among different energy levels. 
Active dosimeters most commonly used to measure photon and beta radiation display dose 
readings electronically on a screen. Pencil dosimeters (also known as pocket dosimeters) are also 
active dosimeters. In a pencil dosimeter, doses are indicated by the position of a thin line on a 
radiation exposure scale. 
There are many dosimeter technologies available for measuring photon and beta radiation. 
Passive whole-body dosimeters include thermoluminescent dosimeters and optically stimulated 
luminescence dosimeters. Active whole-body dosimeters include direct-reading dosimeters, also 
known as electronic personal dosimeters or personal alarming dosimeters. 
Measurement techniques for determining doses resulting from photon and beta radiation are 
generally inappropriate for measuring neutron radiation since neutrons interact differently in 
matter.

Various neutron dosimeter options exist. Examples include personal neutron dosimeters (of which 
the most popular is the solid-state nuclear track detector) and portable neutron survey meters. 
These dosimeter technologies are further described in section 4.1. 
Many factors influence the quality of a dosimeter’s results: 
 
A dosimeter’s response will vary depending on the energy of the radiation and the angle of 
incidence of radiation relative to the dosimeter’s detector. 
 
Dosimeters vary in their ability to detect different types of radiation (photon, beta or neutron). 
 
A dosimeter’s signal can fade over time; this can be caused by environmental factors such as 
temperature, light and humidity. 
 
Some dosimeters are limited in their ability to perform in pulsed radiation fields.2 
 
Some dosimeters are more sensitive and can detect a lower quantity of radiation than others. 
 
Dosimeters differ in their ability to withstand severe environmental conditions. 
Any limitations regarding the above factors should be discussed with the dosimetry service 
provider or manufacturer so that they are well understood. These limitations should be 
documented and workers should be trained so that appropriate precautions can be taken to prevent 
any impact on dose results. For example, many active dosimeters are known to perform poorly in 
pulsed radiation fields. Therefore, if pulsed radiation fields contribute significantly to dose, this 
should be taken into account when selecting the most appropriate dosimeter for ascertaining 
worker dose. 
A dosimeter’s response is the measured or evaluated value divided by the conventionally true 
value. The conventionally true value, also known as “best estimate,” is the value attributed to a 
quantity and accepted as having an uncertainty appropriate for a given purpose. The response will 
vary depending on the type and energy of radiation to which the dosimeter is exposed. Dosimetry 
service providers may provide the option to apply standard correction factors applicable to 
specific radionuclides or energies to obtain more accurate results. These options should be 
carefully considered in consultation with the dosimetry service provider. If correction factors are 
applied, they should be documented and reviewed if any changes occur in the workplace or work 
activities that could affect their validity. 
Dosimeters should be secured to the body to prevent them from falling off during work activities, 
facing outward and not covered by other items or devices. They should be worn on the trunk of 
the body between the waist and shoulders at the location of the highest expected exposure (or 
placed as per the manufacturer’s specifications). 
When dosimeters are not worn, they should be stored in an area where dose rates are as close to 
background as possible and where storage conditions are favourable (areas where dosimeters are 
protected from direct sunlight, extreme temperature conditions, dust, etc.). Dosimeters should 
never be stored near radioactive materials or exposure devices. At least one representative control 
dosimeter of the same type should be kept in each dosimeter storage area during the wearing 
period. The control dosimeter is used to monitor non-occupational dose, to which personal 
dosimeters are also exposed while they are not worn (i.e., during storage and transport). This 
includes dose from background radiation and other sources that are not related to licensed

activities. When processed, the doses reported by the control dosimeter may be subtracted from 
the doses reported by worker dosimeters so that the net occupational dose can be accurately 
determined. Control dosimeters should be shipped with dosimeters during transport in order to 
identify potential exposure to radiation during transport. Dosimeters should be shipped using 
services that will not result in inadvertent exposure to radiation above ambient background levels 
while the dosimeters are in transit. For example, shipping services that ship radioactive material 
should not be used. 
During air travel, the dosimeter should not be packed in checked or carry-on baggage. This will 
prevent a non-personal dose from being recorded on the dosimeter as a result of exposure to 
X-ray/CT scanners in use by most airports as part of baggage security screening protocols. Best 
practice is to carry or wear the dosimeter through the security screening point. 
Precautions should be taken to protect dosimeters from being contaminated with radioactive 
material. However, this should always be done in consultation with the manufacturer or 
dosimetry service provider to ensure that any precautions taken do not impact dosimeter results. 
Procedures should be in place to deal with dosimeters that have been compromised (e.g., lost, 
damaged or subjected to non-personal exposures). These situations should be investigated and 
appropriate actions should be taken as soon as possible. The investigation should involve 
discussions with the worker whose dosimeter was compromised and with the dosimetry service 
provider. A replacement dosimeter should be provided and, if appropriate, a dose change request 
should be submitted to the CNSC as per guidance provided in Part C of this document. 
4.1 
Dosimeter technologies 
The dosimeter technologies described in this section are examples of commonly used active and 
passive dosimeters. Other technologies are also available. 
If a dosimeter reports an unexpected result or exceeds an action level, an investigation should be 
carried out as per REGDOC-2.7.1 [1]. This should include inspection of the dosimeter for 
contamination, if applicable. The dosimetry service provider should be consulted to investigate 
the analysis associated with the dosimeter in question. 
4.1.1 
Thermoluminescent and optically stimulated luminescence dosimeters  
Thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLDs) are commonly used dosimeters. Once a TLD has been 
read, it cannot be reread to verify the result. 
There are many types of TLDs available, including lithium fluoride, calcium sulfate and lithium 
borate dosimeters. 
An optically stimulated luminescence dosimeter (OSLD) offers advantages that include the 
ability to be reread, and it has a low minimum measurable dose. OSLDs operate much like TLDs, 
the major difference being that light, rather than heat, provides the energy required to return the 
excited electrons to their ground state, producing luminescence proportional to the absorbed dose. 
4.1.2 
Direct-reading dosimeters 
Direct-reading dosimeters (DRDs) are active dosimeters, since they display doses and dose rates 
while in use. Many DRDs have alarms that sound at pre-set doses and dose rates. The most 
July 2021 
REGDOC-2.7.2, Dosimetry, Volume I: Ascertaining Occupational Dose 
 
10 
 
commonly used DRDs display dose readings electronically and are composed of either a diode or 
a Geiger-Müller (GM) detector. However, ion chamber pencil dosimeters are still used as well.  
DRDs are used for controlling exposure and are often worn in addition to a passive dosimeter. 
When there is a possibility that radiation fields could increase unexpectedly by a factor of 10 or 
more, a DRD should be used. For many years, DRDs have been used as dose control devices, 
particularly in the nuclear power industry and for industrial radiography. 
DRDs are not typically used to measure doses of record but may be used for this purpose when 
licensed dosimetry is not required or in the event of a lost or damaged passive dosimeter. When 
active dosimeters are used, the energy range, sensitivity, linearity and precision should be 
appropriate for the exposure situations in which they will be used. In addition, quality control 
measures and calibration procedures should be in place to ensure that dosimeters are performing 
appropriately. In particular, if active dosimeters using GM tubes as detectors are used, their 
potentially significant under-response to high-dose-rate fields (>100 mSv/h) should be taken into 
consideration. 
4.1.3 
Solid-state nuclear track detector 
A solid-state nuclear track detector uses a plastic material called CR-39 (composed of allyl 
diglycol carbonate). CR-39 technology is based on the reaction of neutrons with material in the 
detector. The reaction produces charged particles, such as protons, at the site of interaction. The 
protons produce tracks in the dosimeter that are made visible through a chemical etching process. 
After etching, the tracks are counted to determine the dose. 
4.1.4 
Portable neutron survey meters 
Portable neutron survey meters are based on a design that allows them to respond to neutrons 
with a wide range of energies. They are calibrated for a specific dose conversion coefficient, 
which can vary over more than 2 orders of magnitude. Therefore, the neutron energies should be 
well known for neutron survey meters or set for a conservative value of dose conversion rate. 
When used, portable neutron survey meters are usually placed in an area in the work environment 
where radiation readings are highest. By integrating the dose rate over the period of time that 
workers spend in that location, doses can be estimated and assigned to each worker. With this 
measurement method, the neutron survey meter’s highest measured dose rate is used. This 
ensures that resulting assigned doses remain conservative. 
4.2 
Whole-body dosimetry  
The most common dosimeters are those used to ascertain external effective dose to the whole 
body and/or equivalent dose to the skin of the whole body as a result of external exposure to 
photon and beta radiation. These dosimeters are commonly referred to as “whole-body 
dosimeters” or “whole-body badges” and are typically worn on the front of the torso between the 
waist and neck. Whole-body dosimeters typically measure the deep dose to the whole body using 
Hp(10), and Hp(0.07) for shallow (skin) dose to the whole body in uniform exposure situations. 
The most common dosimeter technologies used as whole-body dosimeters include TLDs, 
OSLDs, and DRDs.  
In some situations, the use of multiple whole-body dosimeters (commonly known as “multiple 
badging”) is more appropriate to ascertain external effective dose than the use of 1 whole-body 
July 2021 
REGDOC-2.7.2, Dosimetry, Volume I: Ascertaining Occupational Dose 
 
11 
 
dosimeter worn on the trunk. These situations arise when worker exposures to radiation are 
non-uniform. 
4.3 
Multiple whole-body dosimetry 
The guidance provided in this section on the use of multiple whole-body dosimeters is based on 
the American National Standards Institute/Health Physics Society publication ANSI/HPS 
N13.41-2011 (R2018), Criteria for Performing Multiple Dosimetry [6]. 
The following are situations in which radiation exposures are non-uniform and may require the 
use of multiple whole-body dosimeters. 
1. Workers wear protective clothing or partial body shields, as in the following examples: 
a. lead aprons worn to offer protection to a worker who is required to be in a diagnostic 
imaging room at the time of an exposure 
b. partial body shields used in nuclear substance laboratories, where bench-top shielding is 
used to protect workers who are preparing radiopharmaceuticals 
2. Workers are required to maintain a fairly constant position with respect to a localized field, as 
in the following examples:  
a. boiler maintenance work in a nuclear generating station, where the upper part of the body 
may be exposed to higher levels of radiation than the lower part 
b. work performed in close proximity to a localized source of radiation, so that the parts of 
the body closest to the source are in a more intense field than the rest of the body 
3. Operations are performed near radiation leaks, such as cracks or small holes in shielding 
materials. 
4. Workers are exposed on the sides of the body opposite to where the dosimeter is usually worn 
– for example, maintenance work that requires diving into used nuclear fuel bays, where there 
is a potential for exposure to high dose rates from multiple angles. 
Section 4.3.1 provides guidance for the first 3 situations above.  
For the fourth situation listed above, the number of dosimeters required would be determined on a 
case-by-case basis: 1 dosimeter should be worn at the usual wearing location, and additional 
dosimeters should be worn at other exposed areas of the body. The external effective dose would 
be calculated using an algorithm determined to be appropriate for the specific exposure situation. 
An assessment should be performed on a case-by-case basis to determine the appropriate 
algorithm. 
While multiple whole-body dosimeters may be used at any time to provide more accurate dose 
estimates, the use of more than 1 dosimeter is strongly recommended when the following 2 
conditions exist: 
 
The personal dose equivalent to any portion of the body (such as the head) has the potential to 
vary by 50% from the personal dose equivalent that would be measured with the dosimeter in 
its usual wearing location (the trunk). 
 
The resulting personal dose equivalent could exceed 10% of a dose limit when a significant 
component of the effective dose from external sources comes from a non-uniform radiation 
field. 
July 2021 
REGDOC-2.7.2, Dosimetry, Volume I: Ascertaining Occupational Dose 
 
12 
 
When it has been determined that a worker will carry out specific tasks wearing multiple 
whole-body dosimeters, in addition to routine work in a uniform field where routine monitoring is 
used, a special set of dosimeters should be issued to the worker to be worn during the specific 
work instead of routine monitoring dosimeters. The worker’s total dose is the sum of the dose 
associated with work in the uniform radiation field where routine monitoring is used and the 
dose(s) for 1 or more periods of work in a non-uniform field where multiple dosimeters are used. 
The placement of multiple dosimeters should be clearly documented. A dosimeter worn on a part 
of the body covered by a lead apron should be worn between the lead apron and the body.  
The number of dosimeters needed when using multiple dosimeters depends on the radiation field, 
the work to be performed, the location of the worker relative to the source(s) of radiation and the 
level of information desired from multiple dosimetry. 
4.3.1 
Calculating whole-body external effective dose from multiple dosimeters 
To obtain an estimate of the external effective dose, E, the doses reported by multiple dosimeters 
may be combined using a weighted sum. To this end, the body is considered to be made up of 
compartments, and each compartment is monitored by an assigned dosimeter.  
Compartment factors (WC) have been developed for various compartments or areas of the body. 
The compartments and the associated compartment factors presented in table 2 are based on ICRP 
Publication 103 [4] tissue weighting factors that account for the radiosensitivities of tissues and 
organs that make up various compartments.

The dose equivalent, Hp(10), for each compartment may be determined by the results of the 
dosimeter worn at that location of the body. If there is no dosimeter placed on a compartment 
area, the dose equivalent determined by a dosimeter placed on a nearby part of the body that is 
shielded in the same way could be used. 
The external component of the whole-body effective dose, E, can be calculated using the 
following equation:

If a need for a more complex method of combining dosimeter results arises, further guidance is 
provided in ANSI/HPS N13.41-2011 (R2018), Criteria for Performing Multiple Dosimetry [6]. 
For example, in some situations, neck collars (also known as thyroid collars) are worn along with 
the lead apron. In this case, the model may be adjusted, as the neck is protected by the collar. 
Example calculation 
When protective lead aprons are used, at least 2 dosimeters should be worn (1 on the thorax and 1 
on the head or neck). An example calculation is provided below for the common situation in 
which workers wear protective lead aprons covering the thorax, abdomen and thighs. In this 
example, workers wear 1 dosimeter on the head or neck facing the source of radiation and 1 
dosimeter on the trunk under the apron facing the source of radiation. The head/neck dosimeter 
measures the personal dose equivalent to the head and neck and the unshielded arms. The trunk 
dosimeter worn under the apron measures the personal dose equivalent to the thorax, abdomen 
and thighs. Table 3 provides an example of a calculation of the external component of the 
effective dose for each compartment.

Therefore, summing the effective dose for each compartment, whole-body external effective dose 
is 0.82 mSv. 
4.4 
Extremity dosimetry 
The RPR require that licensed dosimetry be used to monitor doses of radiation received by and 
committed to NEWs who have a reasonable probability of receiving an equivalent dose to the 
skin, or to the hands and feet, that is greater than 50 mSv in a 1-year dosimetry period. Hands and 
July 2021 
REGDOC-2.7.2, Dosimetry, Volume I: Ascertaining Occupational Dose 
 
14 
 
feet are also referred to as the extremities. ANSI/HPS N13.41-2011 (R2018), Criteria for 
Performing Multiple Dosimetry [6], defines the hand as the arm below the elbow and the foot as 
the leg below the knee. The operational quantity Hp(0.07) is commonly used to measure doses to 
the skin, and to the hands and feet. 
Since the equivalent dose limit for the hands and feet is set based on preventing a tissue reaction, 
the dose limit applies to each individual hand and foot. Therefore, when assessing the dose to the 
skin of the left hand and the right hand, or to the left foot and the right foot, they are treated as 
separate entities, with separate equivalent dose limits, and doses to different extremities should be 
recorded separately.  
Extremity dosimeters are used to measure Hp(0.07) and should be worn on or as close as 
practicable to the 1 cm2 area of the extremity that receives the highest dose. It is also common 
practice to wear extremity dosimeters on both hands. Monitoring is most commonly done with 
TLD rings for the fingers or TLD chips taped or strapped to the extremities. In some cases, a 
whole-body dosimeter is worn on the wrist or ankle with the use of a strap. The wearing 
instructions of the dosimetry service provider should be followed. In general, the extremity 
dosimeter should be worn next to the skin, inside any clothing that shields the skin from exposure 
to low-energy photons and beta radiation. Placing the dosimeter under the clothing also protects it 
from potential contamination. 
A worker who handles radioactive sources by hand may need to wear extremity dosimeters in 
order to adequately measure the equivalent dose to the hands. Nuclear medicine and nuclear fuel 
processing are 2 examples of industry sectors whose workers wear extremity dosimeters. In these 
situations, the administration of nuclear substances or the processing of nuclear fuel could expose 
the worker’s hands to higher levels of radiation than the rest of the body. Nuclear power plant 
workers also wear extremity dosimeters when their duties cause their hands or feet to come in 
close contact with nuclear substances. 
4.5 
Lens of the eye dosimetry 
A workplace hazard assessment should be carried out and documented to evaluate if workers are 
at higher risk of receiving elevated exposure to the lens of the eye. If it is determined that workers 
are at higher risk, doses to the lens of the eye should be estimated. These situations include: 
 
workers subject to non-uniform exposures to the eye 
 
workers exposed to weakly penetrating radiation that contributes to dose to the lens of the 
eye, but less so, or not at all, to the effective dose (i.e., whole-body dose)  
Radiological workplace hazards should be reviewed and evaluated to determine if additional 
measures should be put in place to better protect workers from radiation exposure to the lens of 
the eye. In some cases, doses to the lens of the eye may be effectively reduced through:  
 
implementation of engineered controls that, ideally, should be considered at the design stage 
of facilities and equipment  
 
use of personal protective equipment, such as protective eyewear  
 
use of administrative controls, such as procedural requirements and restrictions 
The workplace hazard assessment should determine if any workers fall into 1 of the following 2 
categories:  
July 2021 
REGDOC-2.7.2, Dosimetry, Volume I: Ascertaining Occupational Dose 
 
15 
 
 
workers exposed to weakly penetrating radiation, such as beta particles or photons of low 
energies (i.e., below about 40 keV) – note that beta radiation requires a maximum energy 
greater than 700 keV to penetrate to the sensitive depth of the lens; therefore, beta energies 
below 700 keV need not be considered 
 
workers exposed to non-uniform radiation fields, including when:  
 
the head is closer to the radiation source than the rest of the body (such as when viewing 
or manipulating a radioactive source – for example, looking closely at a syringe 
containing medical isotopes or inspecting manufactured fuel pellets)  
 
the trunk of the body is shielded (e.g., by equipment or protective gear) and the eyes are 
not  
If workers fall into 1 or more of the above 2 categories, the nature of the exposures should be 
documented and the method(s) of assessing doses to the lens of the eye should be determined. 
Individual monitoring for the lens of the eye includes:  
 
dosimeters worn near the lens of the eye that measure Hp(3) 
 
dosimeters worn near the eyes or on other parts of the body that measure Hp(10) or Hp(0.07) 
If workers do not fall into 1 of the 2 categories, doses to the lens of the eye can be assumed to be 
equivalent to Hp(10) or Hp(0.07), and doses may be determined through measurements by 
whole-body dosimeters worn on the trunk. Using this assumption, compliance with effective dose 
limits will also ensure compliance with the equivalent dose limits for the lens of the eye.  
Tables A.1 and A.2 in appendix A provide specific guidance on how to choose the appropriate 
dosimeter for various situations. This guidance is based on information from International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA) TECDOC-1731, Implications for Occupational Radiation Protection of 
the New Dose Limit for the Lens of the Eye [7]. Please refer to that document for further 
information.  
To determine whether monitoring the lens of the eye for neutron exposure is required, the 
workplace hazard assessment should identify workers exposed to neutron radiation. This 
assessment should also evaluate the neutron contribution to the total eye dose. When exposures 
are non-uniform in neutron fields and where the eyes are preferentially exposed, personal 
dosimeters that measure Hp(10) and that are worn near the eyes may provide a conservative 
estimate of the neutron dose to the lens of the eye in some circumstances. Note that this is in 
addition to neutron dosimetry used to monitor dose to the whole body (as described in section 
4.6). 
The dosimeter selected to measure Hp(3) should have the appropriate filter to measure the dose 
equivalent at a depth of 3 mm. Dosimeters should also be capable of measuring a range of doses 
appropriate for potential worker doses and be appropriate for workplace radiation fields. 
Dosimetry service providers should be consulted to ensure dosimeters are appropriate for the 
workplace environment in which they may be used. A dosimetry service provider that has a 
management system and calibration procedure should be selected. 
When a dosimeter is worn near the eyes to monitor dose to the lens of the eye, the location where 
it should be worn (e.g., left side of the left eye, right side of the right eye, centre of the forehead) 
should be assessed. The location where the dosimeter would receive the highest dose should 
determine the placement of the dosimeter.  
July 2021

Eye shielding with lead may be used to reduce dose rates from photon radiation. Non-leaded 
plastic eye shielding is not effective for shielding photon radiation but may reduce dose rates 
from beta radiation. If eye shielding is used, the dosimeter should be placed in such a way as to 
account for the shielding. This means that the dosimeter should be located between any shielding 
material and the lens of the eye. If this is not practicable, a filter that mimics the shielding may be 
used with the dosimeter or correction factors may be applied. The basis for any correction factors 
used should be documented.  
4.6 
Neutron dosimetry 
Many factors (such as the nature of the source; the thickness, shape and composition of shielding 
material; or the geometry of the work environment) can alter the neutron energy spectrum that 
comes into contact with a worker’s body. This makes neutron dosimetry very challenging. 
Doses to workers from exposures to neutrons may be ascertained using active or passive 
monitors.  
Passive neutron monitors (including, but not limited to, CR-39 dosimeters) should be used where 
feasible. They should be appropriate for the neutron energy spectrum at the workplace. More than 
one type of neutron dosimeter should be used to monitor workers exposed to neutron energy 
spectra that are broader than that for which a single type of neutron dosimeter has been calibrated. 
Personal neutron dosimeters are used to measure Hp(10) and should be worn on the trunk of the 
body between the waist and neck at the location of the highest expected exposure. As described in 
section 4.5, when exposures are non-uniform in neutron fields and where the eyes are 
preferentially exposed, personal dosimeters that measure Hp(10) from neutron radiation may be 
worn near the eyes to provide a conservative estimate of neutron dose to the lens of the eye in 
some circumstances. 
Active neutron monitors consist of portable neutron monitoring instruments. Such instruments 
may be used to characterize the neutron fields in a workplace. Personal neutron doses may be 
derived from the results of such workplace characterizations and known personnel occupancy 
times. When used to characterize neutron fields in a workplace, portable monitoring instruments 
should be placed in the locations where the potential for neutron exposures exists. In addition, the 
neutron energy spectra at the workplace should be known in order to choose an appropriate 
monitoring instrument. In cases where the neutron energy spectrum at a given location is very 
broad, more than one type of device may be needed. 
Portable neutron monitoring instruments should be used for dosimetry purposes only when they 
are the most feasible option for ascertaining doses to workers from neutron radiation. 
Portable neutron monitoring instruments should not be used in work areas in which there are 
spatial variations in neutron dose rates such that the instrument may not reflect doses to workers. 
If portable neutron monitoring instruments are used for dosimetry, licensees should demonstrate 
that there is no appreciable spatial variation in dose rates, so that the monitoring results are 
representative of worker exposures. 
5. 
Ascertaining External Dose Through Estimation 
Although direct monitoring is the preferred method for ascertaining external doses to workers, 
paragraph 5(2)(b) of the RPR states that “if the time and resources required for direct 
July 2021 
REGDOC-2.7.2, Dosimetry, Volume I: Ascertaining Occupational Dose

measurement as a result of monitoring outweigh the usefulness of ascertaining the amount of 
exposure and doses using that method,” doses may be ascertained through estimation. For the 
purpose of this document, estimation refers to 2 types of approaches to estimating doses: indirect 
(i.e., workplace) monitoring and dose modelling (i.e., calculating doses based on the 
characteristics of the source, exposure geometry and other relevant parameters). This section 
provides guidance on indirect monitoring and dose modelling. Guidance is also included on how 
to evaluate the equivalent dose to the skin as a result of a skin contamination incident. Quality 
assurance measures that should be considered when ascertaining doses using dose estimation 
methods are also included. 
5.1 
Indirect monitoring 
Indirect or workplace monitoring consists of measuring the dose rate in a radiation field and 
multiplying this dose rate by each worker’s occupancy time in that field. Workplace monitoring 
provides information on dose rates in a workplace and can help with work planning and exposure 
control. It may be used for prospective assessments of doses as a planning tool. It can also be 
used for retrospective assessments of doses, such as in situations in which doses are low and 
constant over time. 
For the purpose of estimating personal doses, workplace measurements should only be used in 
radiation fields that are uniform and consistent over time. The locations of workplace monitoring 
should be representative of worker occupancy. If the radiation field is uniform in space and in 
time, only a few monitoring locations need to be used. Locations where indirect monitoring is 
carried out should be assessed to determine where instruments should be placed and how many 
instruments should be used. The number of workplace measurement locations should be 
increased for radiation fields that are non-uniform in space. Measurements should be taken 
immediately following environment changes that have the potential to affect monitoring results. 
If changes are frequent or sudden, monitoring should be continuous. When ascertaining doses on 
the basis of workplace monitoring, the monitoring results should be representative of all working 
areas where doses are ascertained in this manner. Workplace monitoring data, including the time 
and location of each measurement and the associated result, should be documented. 
Workplace monitoring to estimate personal doses should utilize the appropriate instrumentation. 
For mixed radiation fields, it may be necessary to use more than one type of instrument. In order 
to ensure workplace monitoring is appropriate, the instrument(s) used should be: 
 
selected to measure the types and energies of radiation present 
 
selected to cover the range of dose rates present 
 
selected to operate under environmental conditions or external influences present 
 
calibrated appropriately for the type and energies of radiation present 
 
placed in an appropriate location and direction such that measurements conservatively reflect 
worker doses 
 
capable of scalar counting if very low doses are to be measured 
Instruments should also be selected so that it is obvious to the individual taking measurements 
when the instrument is beyond its range. 
Instruments used to estimate personal doses typically measure in operational quantities, such as 
H*(10) and/or H’(0.07, Ω). An explanation of operational quantities can be found in section 3. It 
is important to determine which operational quantity is appropriate to use as a surrogate for the 
protection quantity of interest. For more information, consult ICRU Report 51, Quantities and 
July 2021 
REGDOC-2.7.2, Dosimetry, Volume I: Ascertaining Occupational Dose 
 
18 
 
Units in Radiation Protection Dosimetry [5]. For example, the ambient dose equivalent, H*(10), 
may be used as a surrogate for effective dose. For exposures to low-penetrating radiation, either 
the ambient dose equivalent H*(0.07) or the directional dose equivalent H’(0.07, 0º) may be used 
as a surrogate for equivalent dose to the skin. 
5.1.1 
Special consideration for the lens of the eye 
Direct monitoring is the preferred method for assessing dose to the lens of the eye. However, 
when radiation fields are predictable over long periods of time, it is possible to estimate doses 
using indirect monitoring at relevant locations. The locations should be representative of the 
conditions under which individuals will be exposed. If ambient monitoring is being considered, 
then instruments that measure ambient dose equivalent and directional dose equivalent may be 
used. If ambient monitoring is being considered, Hp(10) and Hp(0.07) may be replaced with 
H*(10) and H’(0.07) respectively, in table A.1 of appendix A, which provides guidance on direct 
monitoring. 
5.2 
Dose modelling 
Dose modelling to ascertain external doses to workers involves calculating doses based on 
knowledge of the exposure scenario, such as the source term, the exposure geometries and the 
exposure times, and using published dose coefficients and shielding information. Various 
software packages are available either online or for purchase that allow the user to calculate doses 
and dose rates from various types of sources and geometries.  
Dose modelling to ascertain doses to workers may be used when the characteristics of the sources 
present in the work environment and the exposure geometries are well understood. 
Dose modelling methods to ascertain worker doses should be consistent with the following 
quality practices. 
 
Dose modelling should be carried out only by trained and qualified workers. 
 
Procedures for modelling doses should: 
 
be in place to document all work activities that can influence the assignment of the 
correct dose to the right individual and the maintenance of a dose record system 
 
provide details of dose modelling methods 
 
be reviewed and revised as needed when changes in the workplace may impact the 
precision, accuracy and reliability of dose estimates 
 
Verification of dose modelling methods and results should be carried out by trained and 
qualified persons other than those who have participated in the work being verified. 
For more guidance on carrying out simple dose or dose-rate calculations, refer to the CNSC’s 
Radionuclide Information Booklet [8]. 
5.3 
Skin contamination 
This section provides guidance to licensees on evaluating skin dose as a result of a skin 
contamination incident. 
Experience has shown that most skin contamination incidents, if detected promptly, actually 
result in relatively low equivalent doses. The general principles for responding to skin 
contamination incidents are as follows: 
July 2021 
REGDOC-2.7.2, Dosimetry, Volume I: Ascertaining Occupational Dose 
 
19 
 
 
The circumstances of the event are documented, recorded and investigated to ensure that 
work practices are optimized, and to minimize the probability of repeat occurrences. 
 
A skin dose is calculated and recorded by the licensee. 
 
The licensee reports the incident to the CNSC in accordance with its licence requirements, as 
applicable. 
5.3.1 
Contamination meter efficiencies 
Guidance on monitoring for radioactive contamination is provided in appendix C of 
REGDOC-2.7.1 [1]. This guidance should be used to establish detector efficiencies for 
radionuclides used before unsealed sources are manipulated, even if skin contamination is 
unlikely.  
5.3.2 
Background measurements 
Background count rate measurements using the selected contamination meter should be made and 
kept on record for future use in case of a skin contamination incident. These measurements 
should be made in a low-dose-rate area where nuclear substances are not present.  
5.3.3 
Measuring skin contamination 
Step-by-step instructions are provided below to measure and record the net count rate. 
1. Estimate the size of the contaminated skin area using the contamination meter. 
2. Measure and record the count rate directly over the affected portion of skin with the highest 
count rate, and record the time of measurement as well as the time of the contamination 
event. 
If practicable, and if a radiation detector is within close proximity, the first measurement 
should be taken before decontamination efforts.  
The measurement should be taken with the detector placed at a known distance as close to the 
skin as possible (e.g., 0.5 cm) without direct contact. 
3. Determine the net count rate in counts per second (cps) by subtracting the background count 
rate from the count rate measured on the skin. If the net count rate is in counts per minute, 
divide it by 60 to convert it to counts per second. 
If the net count rate is above zero, decontaminate by washing immediately with lukewarm 
water. However, excessive cleaning should be avoided to prevent damaging the skin and 
causing an intake by absorption through the skin. 
Repeat steps 1 through 3 until the net count rate is zero or until subsequent measurements are no 
longer decreasing. 
Some situations may warrant an attempt to extract fixed-skin contamination more quickly, such 
as by wearing an impermeable glove over the affected skin surface to encourage sweating. The 
radiation safety officer or equivalent radiation protection authority should be consulted for 
specific guidance.

5.3.4 
Calculating skin dose from contamination 
If the timing of the skin contamination event is not known, or if a significant amount of time 
(more than 30 minutes) has elapsed between the contamination event and the first measurement, a 
conservative assumption with respect to the time of the event should be made. For example, the 
time of contamination may be assumed to be the time the radioactive material was first handled. 
The average surface concentration (Bq/cm2) for each measurement may be determined using the 
following formula: 
(2) 
𝐶̅ = 𝑁𝑒𝑡 𝑐𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑡 𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑒
𝐴𝑟𝑒𝑎× 𝜀
 
Where: 
C
ത 
= 
the average surface concentration in Bq/cm2. If the instrument reports its results 
in Bq/cm2, it is important to understand the surface area that was assumed for the 
conversion because a correction factor may be required. For example, if an 
instrument reports a result in Bq/cm2 based on a 100 cm2 calibration source and 
the contaminated skin surface area is 1 cm2, the result reported by the instrument 
should be multiplied by a factor of 100. 
Net count 
rate 
= 
the measured average count rate minus the background count rate in counts per 
second (if the net count rate is obtained in counts per minute, divide the 
measurement by 60 to obtain the value in counts per second). 
Area 
= 
the contaminated skin surface area in cm2 if the contaminated area is less than the 
probe surface area and the measurement was taken such that the area of 
contaminated skin was directly under the probe (if the area is unknown or the 
skin is unevenly contaminated, 1 cm2 may be conservatively assumed), or 
the probe’s active surface area in cm2 if skin is evenly contaminated over a larger 
area than the probe  


If the final net count rate is zero, sum the calculated doses to obtain the total skin dose. However, 
if the net count rate is not zero, determine the dose for the time following the last measurement

Part B – Internal Exposure 
6. 
Quantities 
Internal exposures are those exposures to ionizing radiation that result from radionuclides that 
have been taken into the body. Quantities that are specific to ascertaining doses from internal 
exposure are described in this section. 
The committed equivalent dose, HT(50), is the equivalent dose received by an organ or tissue 
from a radionuclide during the 50 years after the radionuclide is taken into the body of a person 
18 years of age or older.3 
The committed effective dose (CED), E(50), is the effective dose from a radionuclide during the 
50 years after the radionuclide is taken into the body of a person 18 years of age or older.4 
The annual limit on intake (ALI) is the activity of a radionuclide that, when taken into the body, 
will deliver a CED of 20 mSv. ALI values may be calculated for inhalation or for ingestion. The 
ALI for inhalation (ALIinh) is given by 
(5) 
𝐴𝐿𝐼௜௡௛[𝐵𝑞] = 
0.02 [𝑆𝑣]
𝑒௜௡௛(50)[𝑆𝑣
𝐵𝑞]
 
The ALI for ingestion (ALIing) is given by: 
(6) 
𝐴𝐿𝐼௜௡௚[𝐵𝑞] = 
0.02 [𝑆𝑣]
𝑒௜௡௚(50) [𝑆𝑣
𝐵𝑞]
 
 
In the above equations, the dose coefficients einh(50) and eing(50) are the CED per unit intake by 
inhalation and ingestion, respectively. These values should be based on ICRP default values 
applicable to the exposure scenario, when site-specific characteristics of the nuclear substances of 
interest (e.g., solubility, particle size) are not known. For inhalation intakes of particulates, unless 
site-specific information is available, the particle size (activity median aerodynamic diameter, or 
AMAD) may be assumed to be 5 μm. For inhalation intakes of gases and vapours, unless 
site-specific information is available, the appropriate CED per unit intake should be selected 
according to ICRP recommendations. ICRP default dose coefficients for inhalation or ingestion 
should be adopted from ICRP Publication 119 [11].  
 
 
3 For persons who are less than 18 years of age, the committed equivalent dose is the equivalent dose received by an 
organ or tissue from a radionuclide from the time of intake to age 70 years. 
4 For persons who are less than 18 years of age, the CED is the effective dose received from the time of intake to age 
70 years.

The derived air concentration (DAC) is the concentration of a radionuclide in air that, when 
inhaled at a breathing rate of 1.1 m3 per hour for 2,000 working hours per year, results in the 
intake of 1 ALI of that radionuclide.  
The DAC for a radionuclide is given by:

Intake Monitoring Methods 
Monitoring workers for potential intakes of radionuclides may be conducted through either 
individual measurement methods or workplace measurements. 
7.1 
Individual monitoring 
The purpose of individual intake monitoring is to verify and document that workers are 
adequately protected from internal radiological risks and to demonstrate compliance with the 
RPR. More specifically, individual intake monitoring aims to ascertain workers’ doses, serve as 
an indicator of potential intake and, overall, support the licensee’s radiation protection program. 
In emergency situations, the purpose of individual intake monitoring is to ascertain and document 
workers’ doses, including the absorbed dose to organs or tissues, and to serve as a trigger for 
initiating health surveillance and treatment. 
Monitoring for intakes of radionuclides may consist of both workplace and individual monitoring. 
The types of workplace and individual monitoring methods at a facility (or location where a 
licensed activity is being carried out) should be selected to ensure the detection of those 
radionuclides identified by the radiological characterization for the facility or licensed activity 
that have the potential to be taken into the body in normal and abnormal (unplanned) operating 
conditions (e.g., as a result of the re-suspension of loose surface contamination or the inhalation 
of airborne radioactivity). The intake monitoring program is considered an integral part of the 
radiation protection program and should provide the necessary data to ascertain the dose to 
workers from intakes of radionuclides or trigger the ascertainment of worker doses in a timely 
manner. 
Individual monitoring may consist of measuring radionuclide activity in the body (known as 
either in vivo monitoring or in vivo bioassay; the terms are equivalent), monitoring excreta 
(known as either in vitro monitoring or in vitro bioassay), taking air samples with personal air 
samplers, or a combination of these methods. The preferred monitoring method depends on a 
number of factors, which are discussed in this section. 
In vivo monitoring involves photon (e.g., gamma radiation) detectors placed at specific positions 
relative to the person being measured in order to detect photons emitted by radionuclides that 
have been deposited within the person’s body. This method can be used only for radionuclides 
that emit X-ray or gamma radiation, radionuclides that emit positrons (via the detection of 
annihilation gamma radiation) or radionuclides that emit energetic beta particles. In the latter 
case, bremsstrahlung radiation is detected. In vivo monitoring is not the method of choice when 
the radionuclides to be detected emit gamma or X-ray radiation with a low yield, when they do 
not emit radiation that can readily be detected outside the body (e.g., photons of energy less than 
25 keV) or when their biological half-time or physical half-life is short (e.g., less than 1 day). For

further information, consult ICRU Report 69, Direct Determination of the Body Content of 
Radionuclides [12]. 
In vivo monitoring methods include whole-body monitoring and partial-body monitoring. 
Whole-body monitoring should be used to monitor for intakes of radionuclides that are rapidly 
absorbed from the respiratory tract into systemic circulation, and that either distribute uniformly 
throughout the body, as is the case for Cs-134 for example, or distribute throughout several 
organs, such as Fe-59. Partial-body monitoring of the relevant organ should be selected to 
monitor for radionuclides that are preferentially deposited in one organ. These include, for 
example, I-131, for which thyroid monitoring is appropriate. In addition, lung monitoring is 
recommended for radionuclides that are absorbed slowly from the respiratory tract (i.e., materials 
with Type M or S absorption5). According to ICRP Publication 119, Compendium of Dose 
Coefficients Based on ICRP Publication 60 [11], such radionuclides include U-235 and Am-241. 
In vivo measurements are acceptable for detecting photon-emitting radionuclides embedded in a 
wound. Further guidance on intakes via wounds is presented in section 12. 
Detailed guidance on establishing an in vivo measurement facility, including construction, 
installation and operation, is not within the scope of this document. It may be found, however, in 
IAEA Safety Series No. 114, Direct Methods for Measuring Radionuclides in the Human Body 
[14], and ICRU Report 69, Direct Determination of the Body Content of Radionuclides [12]. 
In vitro monitoring generally involves urinalysis, and may also include fecal bioassay in the case 
of inhaled insoluble compounds, as well as other investigative measurements such as nasal 
smears. Ideally, urine bioassay programs – with the exception of tritium bioassay – created for the 
purpose of dosimetry should be designed to collect and analyze samples gathered over a period of 
24 consecutive hours. In many cases, this is not feasible or is not the most effective method of 
monitoring workers, in particular for routine monitoring programs. In such cases, alternatives 
may be acceptable. These may include: 
 
the collection and analysis of first-morning urine voiding 
 
the measurement of creatinine concentration in urine to estimate 24-hour excretion (based on 
a urine sample collected over part of a day) 
 
normalization by: 
 
volume, with or without a correction for specific gravity 
 
the length of the sampling interval 
The minimum quantity of urine required for the analysis of a sample depends on the analytical 
method. Licensees should document and implement a mechanism to (i) ensure that a sufficient 
 
 
5 The ICRP classifies inhaled particulates into 3 types, depending on their rate of absorption into blood from the 
lungs. Type F particulates are fast-clearing, being retained in the respiratory tract with a biological half-life of less 
than 1 hour. Materials classified as Type M follow a moderate clearance rate from the respiratory tract (typically 
90% of the inhaled particulates have a biological half-life of about 100 days), while Type S materials are 
slow-clearing and may be retained in the respiratory tract for periods exceeding 1 year (typically 99.9% of the 
inhaled Type S particulates have a biological half-life of about 7,000 days). The chemical characteristics of a 
compound determine its absorption type.

quantity of sample is submitted in each in vitro sample submitted for analysis, and (ii) follow up 
with sample submitters to request a second sample when the sample is of insufficient quantity. 
In vitro analyses involving radiochemical separation of radionuclides should include measures to 
control the measurement process by the use of chemical yield tracers. Such tracers may be added 
to samples to be analyzed or, alternatively, may be added to similar samples, such as artificial 
samples or samples from an uncontaminated subject. The licensee should establish acceptance 
criteria for in vitro sample results from the laboratory. Such criteria should include a minimum 
chemical yield. Samples with a chemical yield below this threshold should not be used for 
dosimetry, and a reanalysis of the sample should be requested. 
In the case of urine bioassay measuring tritium excretion as tritiated water, single (spot) urine 
samples of a few millilitres (for routine monitoring) may be analyzed for tritium activity. 
Converting the concentration of tritiated water in urine to the resulting effective dose rate is 
addressed in appendix D. 
Urine bioassay programs may also be useful for non-dosimetry purposes, specifically, as a 
screening tool to identify potential intakes of radionuclides. In such cases, spot samples may be 
sufficient to allow for the detection of intakes. However, the sample submission frequency and 
the sensitivity of the analytical method should be demonstrated to ensure that intakes potentially 
leading to an annual CED of 1 mSv do not go undetected. Urine bioassay programs should 
include measures to prevent contamination of the samples. Such programs should also ensure that 
the sample volume required for analysis is sufficient so that adequate sensitivity can be achieved 
to meet the needs of the radiation protection program it supports. 
The analysis of fecal samples is generally carried out as part of a response to a known or 
suspected abnormal inhalation intake of Type M or S material. If possible, collection over a 
period of 2 to 3 days should occur in the first week following the abnormal intake. Fecal 
excretion rates of radionuclides in the first few days following an acute inhalation vary 
significantly. Furthermore, early fecal sampling results may allow for the identification of 
exposed individuals. 
Nasal smears may be used as a screening tool to identify potential inhalation intakes. Positive 
nasal smear results should be followed up with in vitro and/or in vivo measurements, as 
appropriate for the radionuclide(s) identified and their associated solubility, in order to confirm 
whether an intake has occurred and to quantify it. 
Several factors should be considered when selecting the method of bioassay monitoring. The first 
factor is the objective of monitoring – there should be a balance between the needs for intake 
monitoring and dose assessment. Intake monitoring requires timely information about the 
occurrence of intakes and should be based on the following indicators of intake, in order of 
preference: 
1. personal air sampler (PAS) or workplace static air sampler (SAS) 
2. nasal swabs 
3. if appropriate for the radionuclides of concern: 
a. in vivo bioassay 
b. in vitro bioassay 
When the objective of monitoring is ascertaining dose, the order of preference is different than 
above:

1. if appropriate for the radionuclides of concern:

b. in vitro bioassay 
2. personal air sampling 
Information on air sampling can be found in section 7.2. Table 5 illustrates suggested methods of 
bioassay measurement that may be performed for selected radionuclides, taking into account their 
physical and metabolic characteristics. Note that table 5 is not exhaustive and that the appropriate 
methods depend on the physical and chemical form of the radionuclide as well as its route of 
excretion.

Types of individual intake monitoring programs and participant selection 
Under paragraph 27(a) of the NSCA, every licensee is required to keep any records prescribed by 
the regulations under the NSCA, as well as a record of the dose received by or committed to each 
person who performs duties in connection with any activity that is authorized by the NSCA or 
who is present at a place where that activity is conducted. This is intended to apply to all persons 
who may be on the licensee’s premises and exposed to radiation, and who are therefore under the 
licensee’s responsibility with regard to determining and controlling doses. This requirement is 
also stated in subsection 5(1) of the RPR. A radiation exposure or dose can be ascertained by 
direct measurement as a result of monitoring, as required by paragraph 5(2)(a) of the RPR. 
Paragraph 5(2)(b) of the RPR stipulates that “if the time and resources required for direct 
measurement as a result of monitoring outweigh the usefulness of ascertaining the amount of 
exposure and doses using that method”, they are to be estimated. 
Participation in an individual monitoring program should be based on workers’ likelihood of 
intakes during routine operations as well as during accidental situations. The monitoring program 
should be designed to provide sufficient data of a level of quality necessary to achieve the 
program’s objective in order to, for example, ascertain workers’ CED, assess the likelihood of an 
intake, and assess the potential for nephrotoxicity as a result of uranium intakes where applicable. 
Sections 7.2.1 to 7.2.4 describe 4 types of individual monitoring programs:  
 
routine bioassay monitoring 
 
special bioassay monitoring 
 
confirmatory monitoring 
 
task-related monitoring 
Baseline bioassay assessments are also described. 
7.2.1 
Routine bioassay monitoring 
Routine monitoring is carried out in situations in which intakes of radionuclides by workers are 
probable during the normal operations of the licensed activity. It is also conducted to detect 
unplanned intakes, and is generally carried out when the potential for intakes is essentially 
continuous as a result of normal operations, that is, when intakes could occur at any time during 
normal operations. Because routine measurements are carried out at predetermined times, some 
assumptions are made about the time and pattern of intakes (e.g., acute vs. chronic, acute at the 
midpoint in the monitoring interval). 
Routine monitoring programs should ensure that annual CEDs to workers of 1 mSv or more do 
not go undetected. The licensee should therefore identify which workers have a reasonable 
probability of receiving: 
July 2021 
REGDOC-2.7.2, Dosimetry, Volume I: Ascertaining Occupational Dose 
 
28 
 
 
an annual CED (i.e., resulting from all occupational intakes of radionuclides in 1 year) up to 
1 mSv (for persons who are not NEWs) 
 
an annual CED greater than 1 mSv and a total annual effective dose (i.e., the sum of the 
annual effective dose from external sources and the annual CED) of up to 5 mSv (NEWs 
participating in a routine bioassay program that is not necessarily provided by a licensed 
dosimetry service) 
 
an annual CED greater than 1 mSv and a total annual effective dose greater than 5 mSv 
(NEWs participating in a routine bioassay program and for whom measurements are provided 
by a licensed dosimetry service) (RPR, section 8) 
In some circumstances, the probability of exceeding 1 mSv per year may be assessed on the basis 
of the activity handled by the worker, the type of radionuclides involved, the physical and 
chemical form of the radionuclides, the type of containment used, and the nature of the operations 
performed. When one type of radionuclide is handled daily (i.e., approximately 250 days per 
year), workers handling the activities in table 6 should participate in a routine bioassay program. 
Note that, in order for a decision to be made on participation, bioassay monitoring results from 
over at least a 2-year period may supersede the data in table 6. 
Workers who do not have a reasonable probability of exceeding a CED of 1 mSv per year should 
also be considered for routine monitoring. However, under paragraph 5(2)(b) of the RPR, the 
licensee may ascertain doses to these workers by estimation “if the time and resources required 
for direct measurement as a result of monitoring outweigh the usefulness of ascertaining the 
amount of exposure and doses using that method”. 
The basis for the values in table 6 is presented in appendix B, “Assessing the Activity Handled 
for Selecting Participants in a Routine Intake Monitoring Program,” and may be used to derive 
site-specific values. Appendix B defines parameters needed to define the potential intake fraction 
(PIF). Given a particular scenario of intake, the value ALI/PIF represents the activity handled per 
day of operation that could result in an annual intake equal to the ALI, consequently resulting in a 
CED of 20 mSv per year. The criterion set for bioassay participation is 1 mSv/year. Therefore, 
the data shown in table 6 represent the quantity ALI / (20  PIF).

When radionuclides are handled less frequently than daily, the values in table 6 may be modified 
following the method in appendix B. 
Bioassay is also recommended for workers who are required to wear respiratory protection 
equipment specifically to limit the intake of radionuclides. 
July 2021 
REGDOC-2.7.2, Dosimetry, Volume I: Ascertaining Occupational Dose 
 
29 
 
The category “Sealed vials and syringes” in table 6 applies to sources that meet the following 
conditions: 
 
They are handled exclusively in sealed vials and syringes. 
 
They have a radiological half-life of less than 7 days. 
 
The handling of radioactivity is more or less uniform throughout the year. 
 
The radioactive material is not aerosolized, or boiled in an open or vented container. 
 
The radioactive material is in the form of a dilute liquid solution. 
 
The radioactive material is contained in a multi-dose vial that is never opened, and amounts 
are withdrawn only into hypodermic syringes for immediate injection into another multi-dose 
vial or another form of closed containment, or into patients. 
 
Contamination control measures are effective, and routine surface monitoring is being carried 
out where the sealed vials and syringes are handled. 
The “Sealed vials and syringes” category is intended to encompass those compounds for which 
routine bioassay monitoring periods may be impractical due to their short half-life, with 
additional consideration given to the added containment afforded by the vial as described in 
item 6 above. Compounds may be classified as “Sealed vials and syringes” provided that the 
potential for intake is controlled by effective contamination control and the radiation protection 
measures are effective. 
The data in table 6 are provided as generalizations and may not cover all scenarios. In addition, 
where there are mechanical or other physical barriers in place to protect the worker (such as 
gloveboxes and fume hoods), the barriers should be appropriate for the nuclear substance being 
handled, and they should be used as intended and maintained in a proper manner. 
When more than one type of radionuclide is handled in one or more chemical forms, or when 
more than one process can lead to intakes (e.g., involving various containment types or 
occupancy factors), the following steps should be followed to determine if a worker should 
participate in a bioassay program: 
1. Calculate the ratio, rj, of the quantity of one radionuclide, j, handled in daily operation, to the 
maximum quantity of that radionuclide that can be handled in daily operation above which 
bioassay is recommended, from table 6. 
2. Calculate this ratio for all N radionuclides handled. 
3. Add all of the ratios calculated in steps 1 and 2 above: 
(8) 
𝐵𝑖𝑜𝑎𝑠𝑠𝑎𝑦 𝑇ℎ𝑟𝑒𝑠ℎ𝑜𝑙𝑑 (𝐵்) = ෍𝑟
௝
ே
௝ୀଵ
 
Bioassay should be performed for any radionuclide for which rj ≥ 1. If BT ≥ 1, bioassay should be 
performed for any radionuclide, chemical form or process for which rj ≥ 0.3. In situations where 
BT < 1 but any of the rj values are greater than 0.3, the licensee may choose to monitor the worker 
for these radionuclides. When assessing the need to carry out routine intake monitoring, 
radioactive impurities that may be present in a product, such as a radiopharmaceutical, should be 
included in the assessment. 
July 2021 
REGDOC-2.7.2, Dosimetry, Volume I: Ascertaining Occupational Dose 
 
30 
 
A baseline assessment should be carried out before work requiring routine bioassay monitoring. 
This assessment determines the worker’s exposure to radionuclides resulting from previous work 
experience, medical procedures or natural radioactivity in the body. 
Baseline bioassay assessment is appropriate for any of the following circumstances: 
1. The worker has had prior exposure to the pertinent radionuclides and the effective retention 
in the body might exceed the derived activity (DA) (see section 7.2.5) 
2. The exposure history is missing or inconclusive. 
3. The worker will be working with radionuclides that may be detectable in bioassay and that 
are attributable to non-occupational sources (e.g., radionuclides administered for medical 
purposes). 
7.2.2 
Special bioassay monitoring 
Special bioassay monitoring is performed in response to a particular circumstance, such as a 
known or suspected intake of radionuclides due to an abnormal incident in the workplace. Special 
bioassays are also termed “non-routine” or “ad hoc.” Special bioassay monitoring may be 
triggered by either a routine monitoring result or an abnormal incident suggesting that an action 
level (as defined in the RPR) or the dose limit may have been exceeded. Special bioassays may 
also be triggered by a licensee-defined criterion, such as a worker’s CED exceeding 1 mSv. In 
such cases, the dose should be ascertained on the basis of case-specific data. Guidance on special 
bioassay monitoring can be found in appendix C. 
7.2.3 
Confirmatory monitoring 
A confirmatory monitoring program is intended to verify whether: 
 
assumptions about radiological exposure conditions in the workplace are accurate 
 
protection measures are effective 
 
routine bioassay is required 
It may involve workplace monitoring or limited individual monitoring of workers who do not 
meet the criteria for participation in a routine bioassay monitoring program. When workers 
handle or may be exposed to unsealed radionuclides but do not meet the criteria for participation 
in a routine bioassay program, intake monitoring may be assessed as part of a confirmatory 
monitoring program. The monitoring frequency may be the same as for routine monitoring or 
may vary if potential exposure to the unsealed radionuclides is infrequent (taking into account the 
biological half-life of the radionuclides). 
In a confirmatory monitoring program, workers submit to in vivo or in vitro bioassay, which may 
involve sampling a fraction of a group of workers. Alternatively, confirmatory monitoring may be 
carried out using personal air samples collected in the breathing zone. When the results of 
confirmatory monitoring show that an annual CED of 1 mSv could go undetected without routine 
monitoring, further measurements should be taken to confirm the intake, and an investigation 
should be carried out to determine the cause of the unexpected result. If the intake is confirmed, 
assumptions about radiological exposure conditions in the workplace and the effectiveness of 
protection measures in place should be reviewed, and the need for involved workers to participate 
in a routine bioassay program should be re-evaluated. All confirmatory monitoring results should 
be recorded. 
July 2021 
REGDOC-2.7.2, Dosimetry, Volume I: Ascertaining Occupational Dose 
 
31 
 
Confirmatory monitoring should be used to review the basis for a routine monitoring program if 
major changes have been made to the facility or to the operations at the facility. Furthermore, 
confirmatory monitoring, consisting of using personal air samplers or individual bioassay 
measurements, should be used to verify that workplace air monitoring results can be considered 
to be representative. 
7.2.4 
Task-related monitoring 
The purpose of task-related monitoring is to provide information about a particular operation or 
task and may provide a basis for decisions on the conduct of the operation or task. It is typically 
used for short-term tasks. Task-related monitoring should be conducted as routine monitoring, 
unless the circumstances of the operation dictate otherwise, such as if the radionuclides involved 
may be different or if the probability or potential magnitude of internal exposure may be 
significantly greater. 
7.2.5 
Monitoring interval 
When selecting a routine monitoring frequency, the main factors to be taken into account are: 
1. the workplace characteristics 
2. the uncertainty regarding the time of intake 
3. instrument sensitivity 
4. the need for timely information concerning the occurrence of intakes 
5. the effective half-life of the radionuclides for which monitoring is being carried out  
The routine monitoring frequency should be determined on an a priori basis and should consider 
workers’ likely exposures. For each radionuclide in the workplace, the physical and chemical 
form should be known for both routine and non-routine monitoring. These forms determine the 
retention in and clearance from the respiratory tract following inhalation of each radionuclide, as 
well as their respective excretion routes and rates. The latter will also guide the selection of 
appropriate bioassay methods. 
Guidance on the selection of lung absorption types for various compounds can be found in ICRP 
Publication 119, Compendium of Dose Coefficients Based on ICRP Publication 60 [11]. Details 
on the ICRP human respiratory tract model can be found in ICRP Publication 66, Human 
Respiratory Tract Model for Radiological Protection [15] and its update [13].  
Another factor in selecting a routine monitoring frequency is the uncertainty in the intake 
estimate due to the unknown time of intake. Unless evidence exists supporting a chronic intake 
pattern, routine measurement results should be assessed in such a way that the intake is assumed 
to have taken place at the midpoint in the monitoring period. 
Instrument sensitivity has a significant impact on the monitoring frequency. The monitoring 
frequency should be selected so as to ensure that significant doses are not missed. A dose could 
be missed if, following an intake, the body content or excretion rate of radionuclides taken into 
the body was reduced to a level less than the instrument’s minimum detectable activity (MDA) 
during the time between the intake and measurement. The effective half-life is a measure of the 
rate at which the body content and excretion rate of radionuclides decrease over time after being 
taken into the body. When practicable, the monitoring period should be such that annual intakes 
corresponding to a CED of 1 mSv do not go undetected. If this cannot be achieved, workplace 
monitoring and personal air sampling should be used to supplement intake monitoring. By 
July 2021 
REGDOC-2.7.2, Dosimetry, Volume I: Ascertaining Occupational Dose 
 
32 
 
applying the appropriate metabolic model and assuming a pattern of intake, a suitable monitoring 
period can be determined. 
In order to relate bioassay results to the extrapolated annual dose, the DA has been defined as 
follows: 
(9) 
𝐷𝐴= 1
20  𝐴𝐿𝐼 𝑇
365  𝑚 (𝑇2
ൗ) 
Where: 
T 
= 
the monitoring period, in days 
m(T/2) 
= 
the fraction of the intake that is retained in a tissue, organ or the whole body, 
or excreted from the body at the midpoint in the monitoring period 
ALI 
= 
The annual limit on intake 
Values of m(T/2) should be obtained based on current6 ICRP biokinetic models.  
Since the uncertainty resulting from the unknown time of intake relative to the time of monitoring 
should be less than a factor of 3, the monitoring interval should also satisfy the following 
condition: 
(10) 
𝑚(𝑇2
ൗ)
𝑚(𝑇)  ≤3 
When the above condition is met, the recommended maximum monitoring period is taken as the 
time at which the DA is equal to the MDA. If exposures to more than one radionuclide may 
occur, the monitoring period should be determined so that an annual CED of 1 mSv from all 
radionuclides can reliably be detected and assessed. The MDA is defined as follows: when the 
sample or subject count time is different than the background count time. For further information, 
consult the Health Physics article titled “Minimum Detectable Activity When Background is 
Counted Longer than the Sample” [16]. Equation 11 applies when the distribution of the net 
signal is approximately normal. Consequently, equation 11 does not apply to situations in which 
the number of counts is low. In cases of low-level counters, licensees may refer to reports such as 
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s  Multi-Agency Radiological Laboratory Analytical 
Protocols Manual (MARLAP), chapter 20 [17].

In some cases, the best available monitoring methods may still be unable to reliably detect intakes 
corresponding to 1 mSv per year. In these circumstances it is useful to determine the maximum 
dose that could be missed if an intake occurred at the start of each monitoring period. Such an 
approach provides a useful perspective for some internal hazards that are difficult to detect, but 
can become overly conservative, particularly when there are several monitoring periods per year. 
Using this method for monitoring period determination, a recommended monitoring period of 1 
year could be possible for some radionuclides. However, most individuals’ retention and 
excretion rates tend to vary from the model on which the DA values are based. In addition, timely 
information about the occurrence of intakes is needed. There should be a balance between using 
bioassay as an intake indicator and using bioassay for dose assessment purposes. To account for 
this, a monitoring period shorter than 1 year may be selected depending on other types of 
monitoring in place (such as workplace air monitoring) and the practicability of carrying out the 
bioassay measurements. The International Organization for Standardization publication 
ISO 20553:2006, Radiation Protection – Monitoring of Workers Occupationally Exposed to a 
Risk of Internal Contamination with Radioactive Material [18], provides suggestions regarding 
monitoring frequency for various radionuclides and their typical chemical forms. 
7.3 
Air monitoring to ascertain worker dose 
Airborne radioactive material refers to any suspension in air of radioactive material. The 
characteristics or concentrations may be such that there is no practical means to determine dose 
through bioassay. Airborne radioactive materials exist in various physical and chemical forms, 
including dust, gas, fumes and vapours. This section applies to measurements of radioactive

REGDOC-2.7.2, Dosimetry, Volume I: Ascertaining Occupational Dose 
 
34 
 
material in air that are used for dosimetry purposes. Air monitoring to ascertain worker dose from 
radon progeny is not considered in this section. Appendix G presents guidance on that topic. 
Workplace monitoring methods that may be used to monitor individual intakes of radionuclides 
include personal air sampling and static air sampling. A personal air sampler (PAS) is a portable 
device that is worn by an individual. It includes a sampling head containing an appropriate 
collection medium (e.g., filter), a calibrated air pump, an air flow rate control and a battery. The 
sampling head should be worn on the upper trunk and in the individual’s breathing zone, which is 
defined as being within 30 cm of the individual’s head [19]. Air is drawn through the filter by a 
calibrated pump, also worn by the worker. The activity on the filter should be measured at the end 
of the wearing period. Static (or fixed-location) air samplers are used to monitor the concentration 
of radionuclides in the workplace air. A static air sampler (SAS) may consist of a grab sampling 
device or a continuous monitor. An SAS consists of an appropriate collection medium, an air 
pump and air flow adjustment. The collection medium may be analyzed in a laboratory. However, 
some SASs provide real-time monitoring and may be equipped with an alarm set to sound at a 
predetermined activity or collection rate. 
SAS results should be used with caution as a measure of an individual’s intake. Studies have 
shown that there is a poor correlation between PAS and SAS results, with SAS results generally 
being an order of magnitude less than PAS results [13]. Studies have also shown a poor 
correlation between SAS and bioassay results [13]. For further information, consult ICRP 
Publication 130, Occupational Intakes of Radionuclides: Part I [13]. PAS and SAS 
measurements may be used as part of a comprehensive workplace monitoring program, as they 
may provide early identification of possible intakes. Therefore, a personal air sampling program 
should be designed to detect potential abnormal intakes and to trigger special bioassay 
measurements. It may also be used to identify potential problem areas with increased airborne 
radioactivity through review and trending of the applicable static air sampling data. 
The concentrations of airborne radioactive material in air are measured in activity or mass per 
unit volume of that atmosphere (e.g., Bq/m3). The intake (e.g., Bq) from this concentration is 
calculated by multiplying the concentration by a defined breathing rate (e.g., 1.2 m3/h) and the 
occupancy time (h). Alternatively, exposure can be determined in Bq h/m3, and the intake will be 
this value multiplied by the breathing rate. The concentration of airborne radioactive material 
may also be expressed in units of derived air concentration (DAC). Similarly, exposure may be 
expressed in terms of DAC-hours. 
The flow rate of both personal and static air sampling pumps, where used, should not deviate by 
more than 5% from the value used to calculate concentration. The airflow rate should be verified 
each day of air sampler use. If the airflow rate changes by more than ±10% during the collection 
of a sample, the flow rate used for dosimetry purposes should be the average of the initial and 
final airflow rates.  
Air samplers should have a means of ascertaining the volume of air sampled. Airflow meters 
must be calibrated, as required by section 25 of the RPR, at least annually, after repairs or 
modifications have been done to the meter, or if the meter may have been damaged. In addition, 
at the time of airflow calibration, a verification of air samplers and sampling lines should be 
carried out to ensure that there is no in-leakage of air upstream of the airflow measurement point. 
The calibration methods should be based on a current method recommended by the American 
Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists or the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health 
Administration. The method, the instrument’s unique identifier and the date of calibration should 
be documented.

The licensee should demonstrate that the air sampled is representative of breathing zone air 
whenever PASs are not worn within 30 cm of a worker’s head, and (i) the workers’ doses will be 
ascertained on the basis of air monitoring, and/or (ii) annual exposures are likely to exceed 100 
DAC-hours (or the annual CED resulting for inhaled radionuclides is likely to exceed 1 mSv). 
This may be accomplished by confirmatory monitoring using bioassay. In order for the air 
sampling to be considered representative of breathing zone air, the ratio of intakes calculated 
from air monitoring to the intakes calculated from confirmatory bioassays, averaged over all 
workers participating in the confirmatory monitoring, should be more than 0.7. The same ratio for 
each individual worker should be more than 0.5. For further information, consult the U.S. Nuclear 
Regulatory Commission report NUREG-1400, Air Sampling in the Workplace [19]. 
Air sampler particle collection efficiency should be insensitive to size to the greatest extent 
possible. This excludes the use of cyclones to collect and measure airborne radioactive material. 
8. 
Interpreting Monitoring Results 
8.1 
Administrative levels 
Administrative levels are pre-established values that licensees put in place to which measurement 
quantities from an individual or workplace monitoring program are compared. When such 
administrative levels are exceeded, specified actions should be taken. 
Administrative levels signal potential intakes by workers and allow for a graded response to 
intakes. They are not intended to be a regulatory limit per se and may be expressed as fractions of 
the appropriate ALI or CED. When setting administrative levels, the contribution from other 
radionuclides as well as external exposures should be taken into account. For example, licensees 
may establish an administrative level that, when exceeded, triggers a confirmation that the intake 
was in fact real and not due to extraneous factors, such as a contaminated sample. 
A set of administrative levels, each associated with a specified potential dose or fraction of an 
ALI, should be established to allow for a graded response. This set of administration levels 
should include an investigation level, which triggers the licensee to investigate the cause of a 
confirmed intake. A bioassay result exceeding an investigation level would indicate a departure 
from normal conditions and the need to take further action. For routine bioassay programs, 
investigation levels may be derived assuming the intake occurred at the midpoint in the 
monitoring period. Furthermore, if applicable, an investigation level should be established to 
ensure intakes of soluble uranium compounds approaching the threshold for chemical toxicity are 
investigated. 
For some radionuclides and types of bioassay, non-occupational sources may cause typical results 
to exceed the detection limit and potentially an administrative level. If bioassay results normally 
or often exceed an administrative level due to non-occupational sources, such as from naturally 
occurring radionuclides, the administrative level may be increased if expected bioassay results 
attributable to non-occupational sources are known (a study using a control group with similar 
non-occupational exposure but no potential for occupational exposure may be used for this 
purpose). If non-occupational levels exceed the investigation level, then alternative methods of 
intake monitoring should be used if possible. 
The investigation level should be based on a pre-determined dose not exceeding 5 mSv per year. 
When there is a probability of intake that is more or less uniform throughout the year, the 
July 2021 
REGDOC-2.7.2, Dosimetry, Volume I: Ascertaining Occupational Dose 
 
36 
 
investigation level should be derived from a pro-rated annual dose, as described by equation 13, 
and should reflect levels of exposure representing a departure from normal conditions.  
When doses are generally low and the processes are well known, investigation levels should be 
selected on the basis of experience, so that exceeding an investigation level would be a departure 
from normal conditions and would warrant an investigation. In this case, the investigation level 
would be based on an annual dose of less than 5 mSv, and should be revised on the basis of 
operational experience. 
Because bioassay monitoring programs do not directly measure intakes or CED, derived 
administrative levels expressed in terms of the quantity that is measured are generally a more 
useful quantity. The derived level corresponding to the investigation level is the derived 
investigational level (DIL), which may be defined as follows for a routine monitoring program: 
(13) 
𝐷𝐼𝐿=  𝐼𝐿 ቀ𝑇365
ൗ
ቁ𝑚(𝑇2
ൗ) 
Where: 
IL 
= 
the intake leading to the annual CED above which an investigation should be 
carried out, that is, an investigational level 
T 
= 
the routine monitoring period, in days 
m(ᵀÚ2) 
= 
the fraction of the intake that is retained in a tissue, organ or the whole body, 
or excreted from the body, at the end of the monitoring period, when an 
acute intake has occurred at the midpoint in the monitoring period 
If the DIL is less than the detection limit, an investigation should be carried out whenever the 
detection limit is exceeded.  
To account for the reduced dose limit for pregnant workers, a DIL for pregnant workers should be 
established, as described above, on the basis of a fraction of the 4 mSv dose limit for NEWs. The 
pregnant worker dose limit is 4 mSv for the balance of the pregnancy (that is, from the time the 
worker informs the licensee). Given conservative assumptions (for example, that the pregnancy is 
declared immediately), ensuring that the pregnant worker’s dose is < 0.4 mSv per month helps to 
ensure the 4 mSv limit is not exceeded. Consequently, a DIL for pregnant workers, DILPW, may 
be set as: 
(14) 
𝐷𝐼𝐿௉ௐ=  0.02 𝐴𝐿𝐼 𝑇
30 𝑚(𝑇2
ൗ) 
In cases of intakes of more than one radionuclide, the administrative level should consider the 
dose from the mixture of radionuclides. This approach may be used when monitoring is done 
using one radionuclide as an indicator for a mixture of radionuclides. 
When an investigation level, or the corresponding DIL, has been exceeded, the following actions 
should be taken, where relevant.  
 
Remove the involved workers from work that could result in additional intakes. 
 
Determine, to the extent possible, the characteristics of the intake, including the time of 
intake and the characteristics of the material taken in. 
July 2021 
REGDOC-2.7.2, Dosimetry, Volume I: Ascertaining Occupational Dose 
 
37 
 
 
Initiate special bioassay, as described in appendix C. 
 
Review the circumstances relevant to the intake to identify and correct the causes of the 
intake and prevent recurrence. The investigation should also consider the corrective actions to 
be taken. 
8.2 
Accuracy of bioassay results 
Measurement uncertainties arise from counting statistics and other sources that depend on the 
monitoring method. In the case of in vivo measurements, measurement uncertainties may arise 
from such sources as variations in the detector positioning, in the background count rate, in 
subject body size and in the distribution of activity within the body. In the case of in vitro 
measurements, such uncertainties can arise from the measurement of the sample volume or mass, 
pipetting errors, the use of tracers to determine chemical yield, and other causes. 
Measurement uncertainties resulting from counting statistics, which can be described by the 
Poisson distribution, are referred to as Type A uncertainties. All other uncertainties are referred to 
as Type B uncertainties. The overall uncertainty over an individual monitoring result may be 
described in terms of a log-normal distribution. The geometric standard deviation of this 
distribution is called the scattering factor (SF). For further information, consult European

The complete bioassay measurement system should be such that any error in the final 
measurement would have a minor influence on the overall accuracy of the estimated radiation 
dose received by the worker. The following considerations should be included in the evaluation 
of detection instrument accuracy and measurement methodology: 
1. The net statistical counting error: This includes the statistical error in the bioassay count and 
the statistical error in the measurement of the background count. The background count time 
should be appropriate for the standard, sample or subject. 
2. The error caused by variations in counting geometry: This should include allowances for 
physical variations in the subjects or samples being counted, particularly as related to the 
specific counting equipment being used. 
3. The error introduced by the attenuation of the emitted radiation by overlying tissue during in 
vivo counting: The effect of overlying tissue should be considered where the gamma emission 
of the nuclide in question is less than 200 keV, or where bremsstrahlung from beta emissions 
are being counted; this requires the estimation of the average depth and density of the 
overlying tissue (e.g., the chest wall thickness), which may vary significantly from one 
individual to another. 
4. The instrument calibration with respect to the nuclear substance being measured in a 
geometry that is relevant to the actual measurement: The response of the bioassay instrument 
should be calibrated with respect to the nuclear substance of interest, and a regular quality 
control program should be in place to ensure that this calibration is constantly maintained. 
Frequent internal checks using a long-lived radioactive source should be performed on a 
regular basis to confirm that the detector response is constant over time and that the 
instrument is functioning properly.

Ascertaining the Committed Effective Dose 
When the time between the intake and a single bioassay measurement is known, the intake should 
be calculated as follows: 
(18) 
𝐼= 𝑀
𝑚(𝑡) 
In this case, I represents the intake (for example, in Bq or mg); M is the measured quantity; and 
m(t) is the predicated value of retention or excretion functions at a time, t, after the intake. The 
value of m(t) is based on appropriate biokinetic models and is available for default solubility 
characteristics for the material from the ICRP. Values of m(t) may also be derived for 
July 2021 
REGDOC-2.7.2, Dosimetry, Volume I: Ascertaining Occupational Dose 
 
39 
 
material-specific solubility or particle sizes. The measured quantity and m(t) should be expressed 
in consistent units. For example, for urinalysis, M should be the activity of the radionuclide of 
interest excreted per day at the end of the sample collection period, while m(t) is the urinary 
excretion rate of the same radionuclide at the end of the sample collection period. The latter 
scenario typically applies in special or task-related monitoring. 
In routine monitoring, the time between an intake and the bioassay monitoring may not be 
known. In such cases, the CED may be ascertained by assuming that the intake occurred at the 
midpoint in the monitoring period of T days. The intake should be calculated as follows, based on 
the measured quantity at the end of the monitoring period: 
(19) 
𝐼= 
𝑀
𝑚(𝑇
2)
 
In both cases above, the CED may be ascertained by multiplying the intake by the appropriate 
CED per unit intake. In some instances, as with tritiated water, measurements of activity may be 
used to ascertain the effective dose directly. In such cases, the above method may be replaced by 
a method presented for specific radionuclides in the appendices, or as approved by the CNSC. 
If more than about 10% of the actual measured quantity can be attributed to intakes in a previous 
monitoring interval, a correction may be made. The correction to the current monitoring interval’s 
measured quantity may be done by: 
 
determining the intake in the previous monitoring interval 
 
using the appropriate m(t) to predict the contribution of the previous intake to the current 
measured quantity 
 
subtracting the contribution as calculated above from the current measured quantity 
In some circumstances, including special bioassay monitoring, individual monitoring results 
taken at various times and using multiple monitoring methods (e.g., in vitro and in vivo bioassay) 
may be available. In these cases, the best estimate of the intake should be calculated by 
determining: 
 
the value of mj(ti) for each monitoring result and for each monitoring method 
 
the best estimate of the intake, such that I  mj(ti) best fits the measurement results Mi, j 
When multiple monitoring methods are used, the intake should be ascertained by fitting predicted 
values (I  mj(ti)) to the results from all monitoring methods simultaneously. For example, urine 
and fecal bioassay data sets may be obtained as part of a special bioassay monitoring campaign. 
The intake in this case should be ascertained by fitting the predicted values (I  mj(ti)) to both 
data sets simultaneously. Statistical methods are available for data fitting; the 2 most commonly 
used for bioassay are the maximum likelihood method and Bayesian approach. These, as well as 
others, are described in IAEA Safety Reports Series No. 37, Methods for Assessing Occupational 
Radiation Doses due to Intakes of Radionuclides [21], and EURADOS Report 2013-01: IDEAS 
Guidelines (Version 2) for the Estimation of Committed Doses from Incorporation Monitoring 
Data [20]. 
When ascertaining an intake from data fitting, the starting assumption is that the data are 
consistent with the biokinetic model; that is, the measurement results Mi, j are consistent with the 
predictions I  mj(ti). The criteria for rejecting the fit may be based on the chi-squared test 
statistic, and each measurement Mi, j may be assumed to be taken from a lognormal distribution. 
July 2021 
REGDOC-2.7.2, Dosimetry, Volume I: Ascertaining Occupational Dose 
 
40 
 
The fit to the data should be judged to be inadequate if the p-value is less than 0.05. The p-value 
is the fraction of the expected (theoretical) 2 distribution that is greater than the calculated o2 
value. More information on the criteria for rejecting a data fit in the context of bioassay may be 
found in EURADOS Report 2013-01 [20]. 
When the fit is rejected and the estimated intake leads to a CED > 1 mSv, the material-specific 
absorption parameters from the ICRP human respiratory tract model may be adjusted. For further 
information, consult ICRP Publication 66, Human Respiratory Tract Model for Radiological 
Protection [15]. Specifically, the time of intake and routes of intake, if not known, may be varied 
to improve the fit. In addition, the values of fr and ss may be varied, but not the value of sr 7 
(which should be kept at the value recommended by the ICRP) until the fit is not rejected [20]. 
The method for ascertaining the CED may differ or include some additional factors during 
consideration of specific radionuclides. Recommendations specific to tritium, radioiodines and 
uranium are discussed in appendices D to F, respectively. 
10. 
Calibration 
Instruments used for in vivo or in vitro bioassay measurements must be selected, tested and 
calibrated periodically as required by section 25 of the RPR. Calibration must be performed for 
the nuclear substance measured in the bioassay program. Periodic calibration and maintenance 
requirements must be determined and documented based on the necessary accuracy, purpose, 
degree of usage, stability characteristics and other factors affecting measurement control. 
Maintenance and calibration procedures should be documented. 
A record of calibration must be maintained, and calibrated equipment should be clearly and 
indelibly identified (e.g., through the use of labels). When calibration is performed before use or 
with a high frequency (e.g., daily), logging of calibrations may be sufficient. 
Inaccurate, uncalibrated or malfunctioning equipment should be identified and removed from use. 
Measurement equipment that has been repaired or modified should be calibrated and have its 
performance checked before being put into use. 
Calibrations should be traceable to national reference standards. Equipment used as calibration 
transfer standards should have calibration traceable to national standards. Where calibrated 
reference standards are used as transfer standards to set the level of reference by which data are 
directly measured, methods should be established to preserve the integrity of the process and the 
results. 
When equipment is found to be inaccurate, reviews should be conducted to determine the validity 
of data or results, and corrective action should be taken. 
 
 
7 Absorption of radionuclides from the respiratory tract to blood is described using fr, which is the fraction of the 
activity deposited in the respiratory tract that dissolves rapidly, at a rate sr (d-1). The remainder of the activity 
deposited in the respiratory tract dissolves more slowly, at a rate ss (d-1), as per ICRP Publication 66, Human 
Respiratory Tract Model for Radiological Protection [15].

Limiting Intakes of Nuclear Substances by Workers Who Are Breastfeeding 
The RPR require licensees to make accommodations to limit intakes of nuclear substances by a 
NEW who is breastfeeding. Section 11 of REGDOC-2.7.1 [1] provides guidance regarding 
NEWs who are breastfeeding. In particular, when a licensee is informed in writing that a NEW is 
breastfeeding, the licensee must make any accommodation that will not cause undue financial 
hardship or business inconvenience. The licensee may need to implement administrative controls 
for a breastfeeding NEW to ensure that intakes of nuclear substances by the NEW, which can 
subsequently be transferred to the breastfed infant, are minimized. Administrative controls may 
include ensuring that the working conditions are such that there is no significant risk of intake of 
nuclear substances. Consequently, breastfeeding NEWs who do not participate in a routine 
monitoring bioassay program due to the low risk of intakes should undergo confirmatory 
monitoring to confirm that there have been no intakes. 
In the event of an intake, the magnitude of the intake should be estimated to ensure that the dose 
(CED) to the breastfed infant does not exceed 1 mSv. As a rule of thumb for most nuclear 
substances, if inhalation intakes of nuclear substances by NEWs who are breastfeeding are 
controlled to keep the annual CED below 1 mSv to the NEW, then the breastfed infant will not 
receive a CED above 1 mSv per calendar year from these intakes. There are exceptions in which 
intakes of certain nuclear substances (such as S-35, radioiodines and tritiated water) by the NEW 
may result in a CED of more than 1 mSv to the breastfed infant relative to the dose received by 
the NEW. 
Licensees should compare dose coefficients for NEWs with those for breastfed infants (ICRP 
Publication 95: Doses to Infants from Ingestion of Radionuclides in Mothers’ Milk [22]) for 
nuclear substances relevant to their facilities to verify that doses to breastfed infants do not pose a 
risk to the infant and are maintained below dose limits. ICRP Publication 100, Errata to: Doses 
to Infants from Ingestion of Radionuclides in Mothers’ Milk (ICRP Publication 95, Ann. ICRP 
34(3/4)) [23], should also be consulted for corrections to the Tc-99m, thorium and uranium 
tables.  
The ratios of the CED received by a breastfed infant to the corresponding CED received by the 
breastfeeding NEW after an acute inhalation intake are shown in table 9 for selected nuclear 
substances. In order to estimate the dose to a breastfed infant in circumstances where the worker 
continues to breastfeed following an intake, the CED to a breastfeeding NEW may be multiplied 
by the appropriate ratio in table 9 to obtain the CED to the breastfed infant. These ratios were 
derived assuming occupational intakes by inhalation for the most conservative inhalation type or 
compound type (e.g., vapour in the case of I-131). In cases where an intake by ingestion is 
suspected, ratios for ingestion dose coefficients should be calculated from the appropriate 
occupational dose coefficients for adults and for the nursing infant. This method may be used to 
verify that the dose to a breastfed infant, from all nuclear substances taken in by the breastfeeding 
NEW, is maintained at less than 1 mSv per calendar year. The factors shown in table 9 assume 
breastfeeding continues for 6 months. If there has been an intake and breastfeeding is expected to 
continue for more than 6 months, the licensee should consult with the CNSC to determine 
appropriate dose coefficients.

Ascertaining the Dose Resulting From an Intake of Nuclear Substances via a 
Wound 
Intakes of radionuclides via a wound are assessed in the context of special bioassay monitoring. 
The purpose of these bioassay measurements is to ensure compliance with dose limits and to 
inform decisions regarding patient treatment (e.g., excision of the wound, decorporation). In 
addition to bioassay measurements, special monitoring should include measurements of local 
activity at the wound site. 
The selection of monitoring methods depends on the type of wound (e.g., puncture, laceration, 
thermal burn), the category of wound contaminant (e.g., radionuclides in solution, particles, 
fragments) and the biokinetics of the radionuclide. While soluble compounds are rapidly 
transferred to blood, insoluble compounds may be retained at the wound site, and a fraction may 
be translocated to regional lymph nodes, remaining at both these locations for an extended period 
of time. 
The biokinetics of specific compounds taken in through a wound depend on the type of wound 
and its physiological evolution (e.g., healing). In general, the proportion of a soluble compound 
absorbed to blood from a wound site decreases in the following order: 
1. intravenous injection (greatest proportion of compound absorbed to blood) 
2. puncture wounds 
 
 
8 The ratio for Po-210 may be used for conservatively estimating the dose from radon progeny. 
July 2021 
REGDOC-2.7.2, Dosimetry, Volume I: Ascertaining Occupational Dose 
 
43 
 
3. lacerations and abrasions 
4. burned skin (thermal or chemical) 
5. intact skin (smallest proportion of compound absorbed to blood) 
Categories of wound contaminants are defined in National Council on Radiation Protection and 
Measurements (NCRP) Report No. 156, Development of a Biokinetic Model for 
Radionuclide-Contaminated Wounds and Procedures for Their Assessment, Dosimetry and 
Treatment [24]. The categories are: 
1. radionuclides initially in solution 
a. weak retention at the wound site (up to 10% of initial activity remains at the wound site 
24 hours after wound intake) 
b. moderate retention at the wound site (10% to 30% of initial activity remains at the wound 
site 24 hours after wound intake) 
c. strong retention at the wound site (30% to 80% of initial activity remains at the wound 
site 24 hours after wound intake) 
d. avid retention at the wound site (more than 80% of initial activity remains at the wound 
site 24 hours after wound intake) 
2. radionuclides initially insoluble in water 
a. colloids 
b. particles 
c. fragments 
Particles and fragments are solids. They, as well as colloids, can be deposited in lymph nodes 
after clearing from the wound site. 
The following steps should be followed when monitoring a contaminated wound: 
1. The wound contamination should be characterized by documenting: 
a. the date, time, and method and circumstances of the wound contamination incident 
b. the type, characteristics and location of the wound 
c. the characteristics of the radiological contaminant at the wound site, including the 
radionuclides, their chemical form and total activity or concentration 
2. The activity deposited at the wound site should be measured as soon as practicable after the 
wound incident and periodically afterwards, as this will help guide the medical management 
of the case. Follow-up measurements are recommended in order to gauge the effectiveness of 
decontamination and medical interventions. Guidance on the selection of instruments for 
wound monitoring can be found in NCRP Report No. 156 [24]. 
3. An in vitro or in vivo bioassay measurement should be carried out, as appropriate, for the 
radionuclides and their associated chemical forms as determined in step 1 as soon as 
practicable after the wound incident and periodically afterwards according to the frequency 
set out in appendix C. 
4. The equivalent dose to skin at the wound site should be ascertained based on information 
obtained through steps 2 and 3 where feasible. 
5. The CED from intakes of radionuclides through the wound should be ascertained. 
The equivalent dose to tissue at the wound site should be ascertained to determine whether tissue 
reactions are likely, and to verify compliance with the equivalent dose limit for the skin. Once the 
activity deposited at the wound site has been ascertained, an initial conservative estimate may be

carried out. This may be done by multiplying the activity concentration at the wound site by the 
appropriate skin dose conversion factor, listed in table 10.

The radionuclides may be assumed to be surface contamination in the case of chemical burns or 
abrasions. In other cases, unless evidence exists for surface contamination, the radionuclides

45 
 
should be assumed to be retained as deep contamination. For a more accurate dose assessment, 
skin dosimetry software should be used. 
An upper bound to the CED may be calculated by assuming all of the activity at the wound site 
will be taken up into the blood. Dose coefficients for selected radionuclides for this purpose are 
shown in table 11 under the “Weak” heading. Once bioassay measurement results become 
available, they should be used to ascertain the CED. The bioassay measurements may be 
corrected to account for previous intakes of radionuclides. 
For cases in which the activity is cleared rapidly from the wound site (e.g., less than 10% of the 
activity measured in step 2 immediately following the wound contamination incident remains at 
the wound site 24 hours later), the intake may be treated as an injection intake. The intake can be 
ascertained using the equation in section 11: 
(20) 
𝐼= 𝑀
𝑚(𝑡) 
The parameter m(t) is the predicted activity in the bioassay measurement per unit intake. These 
parameters can be obtained from ICRP Publication 78: Individual Monitoring for Internal 
Exposure of Workers: Replacement of ICRP Publication 54 [25], or ISO 27048:2011: Radiation 
Protection – Dose Assessment for the Monitoring of Workers for Internal Radiation Exposure 
[26]. The CED may then be determined by calculating I  einj(50). The latter parameter, the dose 
coefficient for an injection intake, may be obtained from table 11, under the “Weak” heading, or 
calculated using internal dosimetry software incorporating ICRP biokinetic models. The criteria 
defining the categories of wound contaminants, as described above, may be used to determine 
which heading under table 11 to use. For more guidance, see NCRP Report No. 156 [24]. The 
data in table 11 was sourced from the Health Physics article, “Dose Coefficients for Intakes of 
Radionuclides via Contaminated Wounds” [27]. 
For cases in which the activity is retained at the wound site, as determined by measurements at 
the wound site in the first few days after the wound contamination incident, the CED should be 
ascertained using the wound biokinetic model from NCRP Report No. 156 [24] or using another 
model approved by the CNSC. An initial assessment using an NCRP wound model category 
chosen a priori may be carried out. When bioassay monitoring data become available, the CED 
should be ascertained for the wound category that best fits the excretion and/or retention data. If 
the goodness of fit is not acceptable with 1 wound category, based on the criteria in section 9, the 
dose should be calculated considering a mixture of 2 default retention categories.

Part C – Making Changes to Dose-Related Information  
Filed With the National Dose Registry  
13. 
General Process 
The CNSC uses dose records to monitor licensee compliance with regulatory occupational dose 
limits. To that effect, it is important that the doses submitted to the NDR be current and accurate 
to the extent possible. Dose information filed with the NDR may be changed for various reasons 
(e.g., following an investigation that concludes there is an incorrect dose record). The following 
steps describe the general process for a licensee to request, when justified, a change to a dose 
record filed with the NDR: 
1. The licensee submits to the CNSC the investigation report and the dose information change 
request form, which includes details of the change(s) to be made.  
2. The CNSC evaluates the request and approves or denies it based on the information provided 
in the investigation report. 
3. If the CNSC approves the requested change, the dose information change request form is sent 
to the dosimetry service provider, with a copy of the form sent to the worker, the licensee 
contact and the NDR. The dosimetry service provider is responsible for notifying the NDR of 
the change. 
4. If the CNSC denies the request, the licensee is informed of the refusal. 
14. 
Individual Dose Information Change Request Procedure 
1. The licensee conducts an investigation of the event that prompted the request for a dose 
information change and summarizes the information in an investigation report, which should 
contain the following information: 
a. reasons for requesting the dose information change 
b. description of the circumstances and time frame involved 
c. justification for changing the reported dose(s) to the proposed value(s) 
d. calculations to support the request, if applicable  
e. copy of the relevant section of the dosimetry service dose report 
f. other relevant information, as determined by the CNSC 
2. The licensee provides the following information in section A of the dose information change 
request form: 
a. dosimetry service name and group or account number that is assigned to the licensee by 
the dosimetry service 
b. company name that appears on the dosimetry service dose report 
c. licensee name that appears on the CNSC licence 
d. licence number that appears on the CNSC licence 
e. the worker’s name and social insurance number 
f. whether the worker is a nuclear energy worker 
g. serial number of the dosimeter that is shown on the original dose report, if applicable 
h. wearing period or monitoring period as listed on the original dose report, if applicable 
i. 
the requested dose information change  
j. 
investigation report as described in step 1 
3. The worker whose dose information will be affected signs and dates “Section B – Worker 
Declaration” of the dose information change request form. If the worker cannot be located, 
the licensee should demonstrate that every effort was made to contact the worker. In some 
July 2021

48 
 
cases, CNSC staff may approve the dose information change request without the worker’s 
signature. These situations are assessed on a case-by-case basis. 
4. The licensee submits the completed dose information change request form and any 
attachments to the attention of the CNSC single point of contact for the licence. 
5. CNSC staff complete, date and sign “Section A – Licensee Declaration” of the dose 
information change request form. 
6. The licensee informs the affected worker of any change to the dose information. 
If the licensee submits a request to add the skin dose, as determined in section 5.3.4, to the 
worker’s dose records in the NDR, the request should be in the form of a dose information change 
request. The following information should also be included with the dose change request: 
 
the contamination meter’s make, model and calibration certificate 
 
a detailed description of how the detector efficiency was determined 
 
a detailed dose calculation, including measurement times and results 
15. 
Group Dose Information Change Request Procedure 
There may be situations in which dose information change requests are required for a large 
number of individuals and providing dose information change request forms for each individual is 
not practical. In these situations, the licensee may provide the required information in another 
format, such as a table, to accommodate the large number of workers to whom the dose 
information change request applies. 
The licensee should demonstrate that every effort was made to inform each worker of the change 
and that each worker agrees to the proposed change(s) to their dose records. 
The licensee is also required to provide an investigation report as described in section 14. 
16. 
Contact Information 
The investigation report and the dose information change request form should be submitted to:

Appendix A:  Guidance on Choosing Dosimetry for the Lens of the Eye  
Tables A.1 and A.2 provide guidance on choosing the appropriate dosimetry to monitor dose to the lens 
of the eye. These tables represent simplifications of a complex topic, and are provided as general 
guidance. It is possible that licensees may have information for their particular circumstances that is more 
appropriate or advanced. The operational quantities and types of dosimeters listed below may not be the 
optimal choice in all cases. 
Alpha particles and other high linear energy transfer (LET) radiation have not been considered here in 
view of their limited range in tissue. Furthermore, neutron radiation has not been included in the table; 
guidance on that topic is provided in section 4.6.

Notes:  
1. Angle of incident radiation refers primarily to the angle of incidence between the radiation and 
the person. Angle and energy can have a large impact on the dosimeter’s response, and likewise 
have a large impact on whether Hp(10) or Hp(0.07) can be a surrogate for Hp(3). 
2. While the quantities Hp(10) and Hp(0.07) are both appropriate, since the body is non-uniformly 
exposed, the dosimeter should be worn close to the lens of the eye. Since extremity dosimeters 
are typically lighter and smaller than whole-body dosimeters, the extremity dosimeter type was 
selected here, keeping practicality in mind. (Extremity dosimeters by design measure Hp(0.07). A 
whole-body dosimeter that measures both Hp(10) and Hp(0.07) could be worn near the eye, if 
practical).  
3. The statement “the person is moving about in the field” indicates that the person is moving so that 
the radiation is not directed at the person from 1 or more dominant angles. If a person is largely 
side-on to or turned away from the source of radiation, the statement “radiation is not coming 
from the front nor is the person moving about in the field” would apply.

Appendix B:  Assessing the Activity Handled for Selecting Participants 
 in a Routine Intake Monitoring Program 
B.1 
Technical Basis 
This appendix presents the technical basis for calculating the activity handled that triggers the need to 
participate in a routine bioassay program. The method outlined in this appendix is derived from the 
Health Physics Society publication ANSI/HPS N13.39–2001, Design of Internal Dosimetry Programs 
[28]. 
The principal parameter used for determining the activity of a substance above which routine bioassay 
should be undertaken is the potential intake fraction (PIF). It is a conservative estimate of anticipated 
intakes of a substance that could occur in 1 year. It assumes that intakes occur by the volatilization or 
re-suspension of the substance with subsequent inhalation. It is a function of: 
 
the potential for the handled substance to become airborne 
 
the confinement used when handling the substance 
 
the substance’s dispersibility due to energy being added (e.g., heating) 
 
the occupancy time while handling the substance 
 
the affinity of the substance to bind to DNA once taken into the body 
The PIF is defined as: 
(21) 
𝑃𝐼𝐹= 10ି଺× 𝑅× 𝐶× 𝐷× 𝑂× 𝑆 
Where: 
10-6 
= 
Brodsky’s factor 
R 
= 
release factor 
C 
= 
confinement factor 
D 
= 
dispersibility factor 
O 
= 
occupancy factor 
S 
= 
special form factor 
Brodsky’s factor is an empirical estimate of the fraction of material in a process that could be inhaled 
without considering the items in the bullet list above [28]. Each of the items in the bullet list is 
represented by one of the factors in equation 21. Default values for each factor are listed in table B.1 [28].

The occupancy factor is intended to reflect the number of times a radionuclide is handled in 1 year. It is 
not intended to be applied as a fraction of the total time that a worker may be exposed to a radionuclide 
and is therefore a unit-less quantity. In a case in which O = 1, the PIF would represent in this specific case 
the fraction of activity handled that could be inhaled from a single use. In situations in which handling is 
more frequent than once per year, O > 1, and the PIF represents the fraction of activity handled in 1 year 
that could potentially be inhaled. 
The above formulation for the PIF may be modified to account for the protection afforded by respiratory 
protection equipment.

Example: Determining Participation in a Bioassay Program 
Work at a radiopharmacy involves the handling of I-123 and I-131. Work with these radionuclides may 
be carried out by the same person; therefore, both radionuclides are considered in the determination of 
whether the workers should be participating in a routine intake monitoring program and, if so, for which 
radionuclides. 
1) I-123: At a facility, 1.1 GBq of I-123 are used twice per week to produce metaiodobenzylguanidine 
(mIBG) for patient doses. The process is carried out in a hot cell, and heating is applied as part of the 
procedure. The I-123 is initially in NaI form. The following parameters have been selected for 
NaI-123: 
R = 1 (gases, strongly volatile liquids) 
C = 0.01 (hot cell) 
D = 10 (actions that add energy to the material, e.g., heating) 
O = 100 (weekly  2) 
A Te-121 impurity is known to be present in the stock solution (up to 3% of the total activity, i.e., 
33 MBq). The above parameter values are applied to the Te-121 impurity as well. 
The 1.1 GBq of NaI-123 are required to produce 850 MBq of I-123-mIBG. The parameter values for 
handling this latter type of compound are: 
R = 0.1 (somewhat volatile liquids, to account for an unbound impurity) 
C = 1 (fume hood) 
D = 1 (other actions (that do not enhance dispersibility)) 
O = 100 (weekly  2)

The activity remaining in the fume hood, 250 MBq, as NaI-123, is assigned the following parameter 
values: 
R = 1 (gases, strongly volatile liquids) 
C = 1 (fume hood) 
D = 1 (other actions (that do not enhance dispersibility)) 
O = 100 (weekly  2) 
Weekly quality control (QC) checks are carried out on the product. These checks involve handling 
about 0.1 MBq I-123 as mIBG under a fume hood. The following parameters have been selected for 
this process: 
R = 0.1 (non-volatile powders, somewhat volatile liquids) 
C = 1 (fume hood) 
D = 1 (other actions (that do not enhance dispersibility)) 
O = 50 (weekly) 
In situations in which the release factor for a non-volatile compound is not known, R = 0.1 should be 
selected by default. Alternatively, a material-specific value for R may be used when available. 
2) 111 GBq of I-131 in the form of NaI is handled once weekly for dispensing patient doses. Handling is 
carried out under a fume hood. The following parameters have been selected: 
R = 1 (gases, strongly volatile liquids) 
C = 1 (fume hood) 
D = 1 (other actions (that do not enhance dispersibility)) 
O = 50 (weekly) 
The following parameters are defined in section 7.1.1:

In the above expressions, Qj is the activity of radionuclide j handled daily (with specified confinement 
and release factors), PIFj is the potential intake fraction for the specified confinement and release factors, 
and ALIj is the annual limit on intake for radionuclide j. 
The potential intake fraction is defined as PIF = 10-6 × R × C × D × O × S, where:

R 
= the release factor, a measure of the volatility of compounds. R may take values from 0 for 
encapsulated materials to 1 for gases and strongly volatile liquids. 
C 
= the confinement factor. Values of C vary from 0.01 for gloveboxes and hot cells to 100 to 
represent work on an open bench top. 
D 
= the dispersibility factor. For actions that add energy to the material (heating, cutting, 
grinding, milling, welding, pressurizing, exothermic reactions), D is assigned the value of 
10. For all other actions that do not enhance dispersibility, D is assigned the value of 1. 
O 
= the occupancy factor, which reflects the frequency with which the activity Q is handled in 
1 year. The product Q × O is the activity handled per year (Bq/year). 
S 
= the special form factor, which accounts for the risk associated with intakes of some DNA 
precursors. S is assigned a value of 10 for radionuclides bound to DNA precursors, with 
the exception of P-32, S-35 and I-131. For these radionuclides, and for all compounds 
other than DNA precursors, S is assigned a value of 1. 
As indicated in section 7.1.1, routine individual intake monitoring should be carried out for workers 
whose value of BT ≥ 1. Furthermore, when BT ≥ 1, routine individual intake monitoring should be carried 
out for radionuclides whose value of rj ≥ 0.3. 
The rj values for I-123 and I-131 in this example are shown in table B.2. The processes involving I-123 
consist of only 2 items. Consequently, an I-123-specific value of rj is calculated as indicated below. The 
parameters Qa and Qb represent the I-123 activity handled per day of use for each of the processes 
involving I-123.

For all processes that involve handling radioiodines in this case, BT = 111. Since BT > 1, individual intake 
monitoring at the facility should be carried out. Because rj = 111 for I-131, the facility carries out routine 
thyroid monitoring for I-131. For I-123, the value of rj  0.01. Consequently, routine intake monitoring 
for I-123 is not carried out at this facility.

Appendix C:  Bioassay Protocols for Responding to Abnormal Intakes of 
Radionuclides 
C.1 
Introduction 
This appendix describes 2 bioassay protocols that may be used by CNSC licensees to respond to 
situations in which persons may have experienced an abnormal intake of radioactive material. It also 
provides advice on how to collect and handle bioassay samples. 
Sections C.6 and C.7 describe 2 response protocols involving the conduct of non-routine bioassays that 
may be used by CNSC licensees to ascertain the radiation dose to individuals when an abnormal intake of 
a radionuclide is known or suspected to have occurred. 
C.2 
Bioassay Methods 
The radiation protection programs that the RPR require of CNSC licensees typically include provisions 
for bioassays. These bioassays may be “direct” or “indirect”. 
A direct (or in vivo) bioassay is a measurement on the human body for the purpose of determining the 
amount of radioactive material in the body, utilizing instrumentation that detects the radiation emitted 
from the radioactive material. 
An indirect (or in vitro) bioassay consists of the collection and analysis of a sample of human hair, tissue, 
blood, urine or feces for the purpose of determining the amount of radioactive material that might have 
been taken into the body. 
C.3 
Routine and Non-Routine Bioassays 
Direct and indirect bioassays to ascertain radiation doses may be further characterized as “routine” or 
“non-routine,” as follows: 
 
A routine bioassay is any bioassay that involves collecting and analyzing samples or taking 
measurements on the body at scheduled intervals, or at predetermined times, during normal 
operations. 
 
A non-routine bioassay is any bioassay that is implemented as part of an ad hoc response to a 
particular circumstance, such as a known or suspected intake of radioactive material due to an 
abnormal incident in the workplace. Non-routine bioassays are often termed “ad hoc” or “special” 
bioassays. 
By definition, a dose monitoring program that includes routine bioassays is proactive and precautionary in 
nature. Typically, such a program is intended to provide routine and timely detection, measurement and 
confirmation of any radioactive intakes that occur on an ongoing basis during normal operations. An 
example of a routine bioassay is the submission of a biweekly (every 14 days) urine sample for analysis 
for the presence of tritiated water. 
A monitoring program that consists only of non-routine bioassays is typically reactive and ad hoc in 
nature. Such a program is usually custom-designed for the purpose of obtaining key parameters that are 
necessary in order to conduct a specific dose assessment in response to a specific, identified need. To 
avoid prejudicing the results, a non-routine bioassay is typically performed with the subject individual 
removed from further contact with, or exposure to, radioactive substances.

58 
 
C.4 
Selecting and Applying Bioassay Methods 
In situations in which response protocols involving non-routine bioassays are implemented, the associated 
program for conducting bioassays and analyses will typically depend on case-specific factors, including: 
1. the time of intake of the radioactive contaminant(s) 
2. the mode of intake of the radioactive contaminant(s) 
3. the preliminary assessment of the radioactive intake and resulting dose, using the precipitating 
bioassay result and default parameters 
4. whether the radiation is due to a single radionuclide or a mixture of radionuclides 
5. the chemical and physical forms (e.g., particle size) of the radioactive contaminant(s) 
6. the types and energy of the radiation emitted by the contaminant(s) 
7. the rate of decay of the radioactive contaminant(s) 
8. the metabolic characteristics and behaviour of each suspected radioactive contaminant (e.g., retention 
time within the body, solubility within the body, rate of excretion from the body) 
9. when the bioassay results are expected to be available 
10. the number of bioassay results required 
11. the convenience, sensitivity, quality and suitability of the available bioassay equipment and facilities 
The bioassay methods that are most often used to assess radiation doses from internal sources are in vivo 
counting and the analysis of collected samples of excreta, such as urine and feces. These methods are 
appropriate to a variety of situations. For example, bioassays of excreta may be the only reasonable option 
in a situation that involves radionuclides with no gamma-ray emissions or only low-energy photon 
emissions. Conversely, if a person may have been internally exposed to a mixture of radionuclides that 
emit penetrating gamma photons, a combination of in vivo counting and the collection and analysis of 
excreta may be appropriate. 
In certain situations in which a standard bioassay method, or a combination of such methods, does not 
suffice to detect all radionuclides of concern, it may still be possible to use the method or combination of 
methods in conjunction with other knowledge or information to identify and estimate the impact of all 
radionuclides of concern. For example, where standard methods indicate the presence of certain 
radionuclides, it may be reasonable to conclude that certain other radionuclides, that is, those that are 
known to be normally associated with the radionuclides detected by the standard methods, are also 
present. The routine association, in irradiated uranium fuel, of fission product gamma emitters (detectable 
by in vivo counting or gamma spectroscopy on fecal samples using germanium detectors) with certain 
transuranic radionuclides is an example of such a situation. Accordingly, when a standard bioassay 
method detects a surrogate radionuclide, that discovery in light of the known or typical association of the 
surrogate with other radionuclides may indicate that associated radionuclides that can only be detected by 
some supplementary in vivo counting techniques or special analyses (e.g., fission track analysis for 
Pu-239 in urine) are also present. 
In addition, relevant metabolic data – such as organ or whole-body retention times, and urine and fecal 
excretion rates – can often be used (with appropriate adjustments) along with the results of bioassays to 
help ascertain the radiation exposures and doses from radioactive intakes.

C.5 
Response Protocols 
The response protocols recommended in this section are intended to be used following suspected or actual 
intakes of significant quantities of radionuclides. Such intakes typically occur during abnormal incidents 
in the workplace, such as those involving: 
 
the breach or failure of a sealed source 
 
the handling of unsealed radioactive sources 
 
airborne contamination as a consequence of fires or explosions 
 
the failure of personnel protection measures, such as respiratory equipment, during the maintenance 
or servicing of contaminated equipment or systems 
An abnormal incident that occurs at a CNSC-licensed facility or during a CNSC-regulated activity could 
trigger a requirement (under applicable legislation, a CNSC licence or the licensee’s radiation protection 
program) for a non-routine bioassay. 
In particular, when a licensee becomes aware that a dose to a person, an organ or a tissue may have 
exceeded an applicable dose limit prescribed by sections 13, 14 or 15 of the RPR, the licensee must 
conduct an investigation in order to determine the magnitude of the dose and establish the causes of the 
exposure (paragraph 16(c) of the RPR). The activities completed as part of the required investigation to 
determine the magnitude of the dose could include the conduct of a non-routine bioassay. 
If the results of non-routine bioassays are to be credible, care should be given to such details as the choice 
and application of assay methods, the timing and number of in vivo counts, and the timing of the 
collection of excreta samples relative to the time of intake of radiation. Accordingly, persons who are 
responsible for designing and implementing response protocols should exercise competent judgment on 
key matters. For example, they should decide whether to collect and retain samples for confirmatory 
analyses, they should select appropriate times for truncation of sampling, and they should weigh and 
balance the associated advantages and disadvantages. 
When selecting the preferred bioassay methods and identifying any complementary requirements for 
additional biological monitoring, the responsible persons should take into account the factors discussed in 
section C.4 above. 
The response protocols that are described in section C.6 may be used to ascertain the CED resulting from 
an intake of radionuclides. However, users should exercise sound judgment. They should adjust and 
refine the recommended protocols to suit their specific needs and individual circumstances. These needs 
and circumstances will typically depend on case-specific factors, including radiation hazards in the 
workplace and the circumstances associated with the internal exposures. 
It is recommended that, when feasible, material-specific data (e.g., solubility, particle size) be used over 
ICRP defaults in such evaluations because observed rates are typically more realistic than default values 
and thus more likely to result in a more realistic assessment of the associated radiation doses. An 
individual’s rate of retention or excretion cannot be adequately constructed on the basis of 2 or 3 
randomly collected measurements or samples. Accordingly, these recommendations and protocols are 
designed to systematically yield case-specific bioassay data that are sufficient to generate scientifically 
defensible dose assessments.

REGDOC-2.7.2, Dosimetry, Volume I: Ascertaining Occupational Dose 
 
60 
 
The following situations would trigger the response protocols described in sections C.6 and C.7: 
 
A routine bioassay program yields an abnormal result, indicating that a person may have been 
exposed to abnormal levels of radiation. 
 
It is known or suspected that an abnormal incident has occurred (e.g., an initiating event such as a 
fire, an explosion or a failure of a ventilation system) that has a recognized potential to give rise to 
significant intakes of radionuclides by an affected person. 
C.6 
Response Protocol Triggered by a Routine Bioassay 
As the first phase of this recommended response protocol: 
1. remove the exposed individual from any possibility of further intake 
2. confirm the initial bioassay result as soon as practical, using the laboratory that performed the 
analysis 
3. perform preliminary assessments of intake and dose using the results of the initial bioassays, taking 
factors such as those presented in section C.4 into account 
4. if the initial result is unusually high (e.g., much greater than an investigation level or approaching an 
effective dose limit for NEWs), consider confirming it with a laboratory that is independent of the 
laboratory that obtained the initial result 
5. where possible, when routine bioassays of a sample yield elevated results, retain the precipitating 
sample until all investigations associated with the incident are complete  
Typically, samples can be most conveniently retained for use in repeat or additional analyses when only a 
small portion of the total collection is required for each analysis. For example, each determination of 
tritium in tritiated water in urine typically requires only 1 to 5 ml of urine, whereas the typical volume of 
a urine sample may range from 0.1 L to 1 L. Accordingly, a relatively small sample of urine, which 
occupies commensurate storage space, is sufficient for several tritium analyses. 
Where practical, the unused portions of a urine or fecal sample should be retained for further analysis. For 
example, when non-destructive gamma spectroscopy of a feces sample indicates significantly elevated 
levels of fission and activation products, it may be both practical and prudent to reduce the sample to ash, 
and to save a portion of the ash for further analyses. In a few situations, it might be worthwhile to retain 
the unused portion of a sample until such time as improvements in analytical techniques or equipment 
give rise to more sensitive, accurate or reliable results. 
As part of this protocol, non-routine sampling and bioassays are required in response to a routine bioassay 
that indicates that a worker has received a dose that exceeds a regulatory limit. 
To be effective, a follow-up program of non-routine bioassays should take relevant factors into account. 
These factors include the considerations discussed in section C.4, the sampling and counting 
recommendations in table C.1, the radiation protection program, and the characteristics of the 
radionuclides involved. 
Table C.1 recommends biological sampling and in vivo counting campaigns for 3 contiguous time periods 
(“1–10 days,” “10–100 days,” and “More than100 days”). The recommendations of table C.1 cover the 
time period during which the exposed person is removed from further work involving radiation or 
radioactive substances in the workplace. 
July 2021 
REGDOC-2.7.2, Dosimetry, Volume I: Ascertaining Occupational Dose 
 
61 
 
Table C.1 addresses many, but not all, situations that are likely to be encountered by CNSC licensees. For 
example, where short-lived radionuclides (i.e., less than 3 days) are of concern, the time that is available 
for the purpose of conducting effective sampling will be commensurately short, and consequently, the 
sampling regime recommended in table C.1 may not be entirely appropriate. Similarly, the 
recommendations of table C.1 may not be entirely appropriate in situations in which long-lived 
radionuclides are incorporated into compounds that have short half-lives (less than 3 days). For such 
situations, sampling should be carried out daily during the 10 days that immediately follow intake in order 
to accurately define the shapes of the individual’s retention or excretion curves. 
Where the results of a routine bioassay indicate that a worker’s intake may exceed an investigation level 
(IL), arrangements for the non-routine sampling and bioassays recommended in table C.1 should be 
made. It may also be appropriate to plan for any supplementary biological samplings (e.g., of blood, 
saliva or breath) as well as for bioassays that are required by the applicable radiation protection program 
or necessary in order to generate or improve estimates of intake or doses. For example, when an estimated 
dose exceeds 100 mSv, collection of blood samples for chromosomal analyses should be considered. 
C.7 
Response Protocol Triggered by an Abnormal Incident 
This protocol is intended to be implemented in response to abnormal incidents in the workplace, such as 
accidents involving fires, explosions, failure of ventilation systems or failures of protective equipment. 
Abnormal incidents typically increase the levels of airborne radioactivity and can result in increased 
intakes. In addition, abnormal incidents that result in skin wetting by tritiated water can also result in 
increased intakes of radioactive material. 
Because incidents such as fires, explosions or ventilation failures may be self-evident or typically trigger 
alarms or monitors, their times of occurrence are usually well known. In such a case, the time of any 
associated intake of radioactive contaminants by workers can typically be established with similar 
accuracy. 
Following an abnormal incident at a nuclear facility, an increased intake by workers may be suspected 
from indirect evidence. For example, the detection of facial or nasal contamination by portal monitors or 
hand-held detectors, the presence of surface cuts or sores that are radioactively contaminated, or the 
presence of tritiated water on skin may indicate that the individuals have been subjected to an unplanned 
intake. Such evidence can be sufficient reason to immediately initiate a non-routine bioassay instead of 
awaiting the results of routine bioassay monitoring. 
Where an intake of radioactive contaminants is suspected but not confirmed, the timely collection of 
non-bioassay and bioassay samples may help establish whether or not such an incident has occurred. 
Non-bioassay samples include swabs of nasal fluid and surface wipes of protective clothing or workplace 
surfaces. Either the presence of radionuclides in such media or the lack thereof can serve as a reasonable 
indicator of whether an inhalation incident has occurred. 
In such cases, samples should be collected, results confirmed and doses ascertained as follows: 
1. Arrangements should be made for the timely collection of bioassay samples from the exposed 
individuals and the timely completion of in vivo counting, since the initial results of the bioassay or in 
vivo monitoring will influence decisions about further sampling. In cases of suspect tritium intakes, 
the bladder should be voided prior to bioassay sample collection. 
2. If widespread contamination is present, particular care should be taken to obtain uncontaminated 
bioassay samples (see section C.8). 
July 2021 
REGDOC-2.7.2, Dosimetry, Volume I: Ascertaining Occupational Dose 
 
62 
 
3. While awaiting the results of the initial bioassay sampling and the initial in vivo monitoring, sampling 
should continue at the frequencies recommended in table C.1. 
4. The results of the initial in vitro bioassay or in vivo counting should be reviewed and compared with 
the results of the available non-bioassay samples, such as nasal swabs or surface contamination wipe 
samples. 
5. If the radionuclides detected in the nasal swab and workplace wipe samples are the same as those 
reported in the bioassay results, this agreement should be considered to be confirmation that a 
corresponding intake has occurred. 
6. Preliminary assessments of intake and dose should be carried out using the results of the initial 
bioassay results, taking factors such as those presented in section C.4 into account. 
Possible responses to the preliminary assessments of intake and dose are shown below: 
 
If the estimated intake or dose is less than the relevant IL, the protocols recommended in table C.1 
may be adjusted accordingly. Since the intake is relatively low, it is appropriate to consider ending 
sampling much sooner than recommended in the table. 
 
If the estimated intake or dose is equal to or greater than the relevant IL, the protocols recommended 
in table C.1 should be followed. If appropriate, arrangements for additional specialized analyses and 
biological monitoring, as discussed in sections C.4 and C.5, respectively, should be made (for 
example, collecting blood samples for chromosomal analyses when the dose exceeds 100 mSv). 
C.8 
Collecting and Handling Bioassay Samples 
C.8.1 
General recommendations 
1. All persons who handle bioassay samples should be properly instructed in the safe handling of 
biological and radioactive specimens. 
2. The services of a qualified medical agency or practitioner to collect blood samples should be used. 
3. Sample collection in restricted zones should be carried out in areas where the probabilities of 
contamination of the samples are lowest. 
4. All samples should be collected in sterile disposable containers. 
5. When a fecal sample is required from a subject, the subject should be instructed to exercise caution to 
avoid contaminating the required sample with urine. 
6. After collecting a sample in a potentially contaminated workplace, showering or handwashing should 
be done before removing the samples to an unrestricted area. 
7. Where possible, all samples collected should be retained until all investigations associated with the 
incident are complete. 
8. When transporting bioassay samples, measures should be taken to preserve the integrity of the sample 
and to prevent damage, loss of radioactivity, or contamination of the samples. 
C.8.2 
Labelling samples 
After collecting a bioassay sample from a person, the sample container should be labelled with the name 
or identification number of the person and the date and time of sample collection.  
C.8.3 
Treating and storing urine samples 
If the urine sample is to be retained for more than 24 hours before it is analyzed, it should be placed in 
cold storage (such as in a refrigerator or cooler) immediately following its collection. 
July 2021 
REGDOC-2.7.2, Dosimetry, Volume I: Ascertaining Occupational Dose 
 
63 
 
If a urine sample is to be retained for a significant or indeterminate period of time before it is analyzed, 
the sample should be treated to prevent or minimize bacterial growth or radionuclide losses to the walls of 
the sample container immediately following collection of the sample. Measures that are appropriate to the 
situation should be used, taking into account the characteristics and chemical forms of the radionuclides 
present in the sample. Typical approaches include adding acid to certain types of samples to prevent 
precipitation, or adding a preservative such as thymol to minimize bacterial growth. 
Where appropriate, urine samples may be preserved by freezing. Freezing may be particularly appropriate 
and convenient for urine samples containing organically bound tritium, particularly those that may require 
a repeat or confirmatory analysis to determine the organically bound tritium present in the sample. Where 
possible, part of the collected samples should be retained for repeat or multiple analyses. 
C.8.4 
Collecting and storing fecal samples 
When collecting fecal samples, specialty kits (e.g., a “commode specimen collection system”) that are 
designed for the purpose and readily available from commercial medical equipment suppliers should be 
used. Fecal samples that are not to be analyzed immediately should be frozen as soon as they are received.

The bioassay schedule recommended in table C.1 should typically be followed until the subject 
returns to work. However, users may modify the protocol to take into account individual 
circumstances. For example, the 3 discrete sampling periods shown in this table may not be 
appropriate for radionuclides with half-lives < 3 days, for long-lived radionuclides in chemical form 
that have biological half-lives < 3 days, or when the intake is above a detection limit but below an 
action level. 
 
In table C.1 a 24-hour sample is a sample integrated over a contiguous 24-hour period.

Measurements and Internal Dosimetry – Tritium 
D.1 
Analytical Methods for Tritium in Urine 
Tritium in urine is most readily assessed by liquid scintillation counting (LSC) of a urine sample. This 
method involves adding an aliquot of the urine sample to an organic liquid scintillator. Light photons, 
emitted by the scintillator as it absorbs beta particle energy, are detected by photomultiplier tubes 
operating in coincidence. 
Because tritium is a low-energy beta emitter it may be necessary to correct for other beta emitters in a 
sample. Consequently, it is important to have a good knowledge of the beta-emitting radionuclides that 
may be present in the workplace. In order to take these interfering radionuclides into consideration, 
energy discrimination regions may be set on the LSC system. For example, energy discrimination regions 
may be selected in the ranges 0 to 18.6 keV for H-3, 35 to 110 keV for C-14, and 180 to 2,000 keV for 
other beta-emitting radionuclides. Regions should be selected so as to optimize the detection efficiency 
for counting urine samples. 
The LSC system’s energy windows should be set using an unquenched standard (as quality control to 
verify the instrument stability). This setting should also be verified periodically. Because chemical and 
colour quenching from materials in the sample influence the counting efficiency, and because these 
factors vary from one sample to another, the assumed efficiency should be based on the characteristics of 
each sample. Most LSCs have an automatic quench correction mechanism. When this is not the case, a 
quench calibration curve should be established in order to determine the efficiency. The efficiency for 
each energy region should be calibrated using traceable standards under various quench conditions. 
In addition, volumetric dispensers should be verified periodically and corrections made if the variation 
exceeds ± 10%. Periodic verification of the system performance should be carried out. 
Sample preparation should be carried out under a fume hood. An aliquot of the sample and LSC cocktail 
are dispensed into an LSC vial and mixed thoroughly. Traceability checks should be used to ensure 
reliable sample identification. The activity measured in the low-energy region may be corrected to 
account for the low energy contributions from the higher energy beta particles if such higher energy 
beta-emitting radionuclides are present. 
D.2 
Monitoring Frequency 
Doses to workers from chronic intakes of tritiated water, or tritiated compounds that partially convert to 
hydrogenated tritium oxide (HTO) in the body (e.g., elemental tritium gas (HT)), should be ascertained by 
linear interpolation between successive routine bioassay measurements.  
A monitoring period of 14 days or less is recommended when calculating the dose using the linear 
approximation method since this results in the error on the dose being less than 50%. When bioassay 
results exceed 1 MBq/L, monitoring should be carried out weekly until the concentration returns below 
that value [31]. 
A monitoring period longer than 14 days may be selected for workers with a low probability on HTO 
intakes; however, this monitoring period should not exceed 30 days. At such monitoring intervals, the 
condition expressed by equation 10 is satisfied for HTO. 
July 2021 
REGDOC-2.7.2, Dosimetry, Volume I: Ascertaining Occupational Dose 
 
65 
 
It should be noted that when the HTO in urine concentration remains below 45 kBq/L, the annual CED 
remains below 1 mSv. Workers whose HTO in urine concentration is 45 kBq/L or more should submit 
routine urine samples at least monthly. When the IL is exceeded and the intake is known to be acute in 
nature, the linear approximation method should be replaced by the acute intake method described in 
section 9. Those individuals not submitting routine urine samples should submit a urine sample for tritium 
analysis when exposures to HTO may exceed 10 DAC-hours. The DAC for HTO should be calculated by 
reducing the DAC for inhalation of tritiated water only by a factor of 1.5 to account for absorption of 
tritiated water through intact skin. Based on the DAC definition (equation 7), the DAC for tritiated water 
is DACHTO = 3 × 105 Bq/m3. 
In special bioassay monitoring, because the concentration of HTO in body water reaches a maximum a 
few hours after an acute intake, sampling should account for dilution of HTO with the existing bladder 
contents. 
D.3 
Ascertaining Dose 
When routine bioassay is carried out and no significant acute intake is suspected (i.e., when special 
bioassay monitoring is not initiated), the CED (in Sv) resulting from tritium intakes during a reporting 
period (e.g., 1 quarter or 1 year) should be ascertained using the method illustrated below. This method 
should be used for intakes of HTO and HT. 
The accumulated dose, Ek, received during the reporting period k, should be calculated from a series of N 
measurements of tritium in urine made during period k, as shown below [31].

Here, Ci is the concentration of tritiated water in urine, in units of Bq/L, measured at time ti days. The 
concentration C0 is the result of the last concentration measurement made in the reporting period previous 
to period k. 
The CED, that is, the effective dose received from HTO in the body for 50 years following intake, from 
the end of reporting period k, is Ek(50). It should be calculated as follows. 
(26) 
𝐸௞(50) = 8.4 × 10ିଵ଴𝐶ே 
The CED for a dosimetry year is the sum of all Ek values for the year and Ek(50). In figure D.1, ta is a 
reporting time, and the dose reported at ta is the accumulated dose to time t1, as well as the dose between 
t1 and ta (calculated assuming the biological half-life of HTO to be 10 days). The dose accumulated 
between ta and tb may be calculated as follows:

It should be noted that a licensee may propose other formulations that provide an equivalent 
approximation for the effective dose accumulated during a monitoring period as per equation 27. 
Furthermore, licensees may ascertain the CED from tritiated water intakes by applying equation 26 
instead of equation 25 for workers who have been absent from the workplace for an extended period of 
time (e.g., for more than 60 days). 
D.4 
Quality Control of Liquid Scintillation Counters   
The performance of LSC used for measurements of tritium in urine should be verified each day it is in 
use. Verifications should also be carried out following the installation or servicing of a liquid scintillation 
counter and after any event that may influence its accuracy. The information shown in table D.1 should be 
recorded as part of the quality control program. These data should also be recorded graphically on control 
charts.

The check sources used for verifying the counter performance should be flame-sealed. They should be

counting time should be used for each measurement. In addition to a flame-sealed check source, a

flame-sealed background source is recommended and should be counted twice per day. The count time 
for the background checks should not change. 
The standard deviation of the check source and background count rates should be calculated monthly. The 
check source and background count rates should be plotted on a control chart. Control limits at 2 standard 
deviations should be placed on the control chart. About 95% of the daily check source count rates should 
lie within the 2 standard deviation control limits. If either a daily check source or a background count rate 
is outside the control limits, the measurement should be repeated. If the second measurement is also 
outside the control limits, the instrument settings should be verified.

Appendix E: Radionuclide-Specific Recommendations Related to Bioassay 
Measurements and Internal Dosimetry – Radioiodines 
This appendix provides guidance to licensees with respect to developing a thyroid screening program for 
radioiodines. It has been written mainly as guidance to supplement licence conditions for the use of 
nuclear substances. 
This appendix includes recommendations on participant selection for the screening program, instrument 
selection, screening method, monitoring periods, interpretation of results, validation procedures, and 
record keeping. It considers iodine-123, iodine-124, iodine-125 and iodine-131; however, the approach 
may also be applied to other radioiodines. 
E.1 
Background 
The purpose of a thyroid screening program is to monitor workers for intakes of radioiodines. Timely 
information produced by the program should be used to assess any intake of radioiodines, provide 
assurance that the radiation protection program is working, and demonstrate compliance with regulatory 
dose limits. 
In a thyroid screening program, workers are individually monitoring for intakes of radioiodines by in vivo 
counting of the thyroid. Results are compared with a predetermined level. If the predetermined level is 
exceeded, confirmation of intake and an investigation are required. The licence conditions regarding 
thyroid monitoring depend on the physical characteristics of the radioiodine handled. Physical 
characteristics of the 4 radioiodines considered in this appendix are shown in table E.1 [14, 25, 35].

Workers – Normal handling 
Workers (NEWs and persons who are not NEWs) who handle a total quantity of radioiodine in 1 day that 
exceeds the amounts indicated in table E.2 should be screened for I-123, I-124, I-125 or I-131, as 
applicable. Examples of volatile radioiodine compounds can be found in section E.7. That section also 
describes actions that may generate such compounds.

Other persons who regularly work close to a worker handling more than the amounts in table E.2 without 
confinement should also be screened for the relevant radioiodine. The values in table E.2 may be 
modified to account for the protection afforded by respiratory protection equipment. 
E.2.2 
Screening in response to spills and personnel contamination 
Workers and other persons who have been in proximity to a spill, as described by one of the following 
situations, should be screened for the relevant radioiodine: 
 
involved in a spill of I-125 or I-131 in volatile form, where the activity exceeds 2 MBq 
 
involved in a spill of I-124 in volatile form, where the activity exceeds 3 MBq 
 
involved in a spill of I-123 in volatile form, where the activity exceeds 200 MBq 
 
externally contaminated by a volatile radioiodine 
It is important that thyroid screening be completed as soon as possible after a spill or upset condition in 
which there is the potential for an internal exposure. Prompt initial thyroid screening will ensure that 
radioiodine intakes are detected and that actions can be taken, as appropriate, to minimize the worker’s 
CED through the administration of an iodine thyroid blocking agent. Completing thyroid screening less 
than 1 hour after an upset condition may be too early to detect a CED of 1 mSv or less; however, it would 
enable the early detection of a significant intake. In the first few hours following exposure, administration 
of an iodine thyroid blocking agent can be very effective at blocking the uptake of radioiodine by the 
thyroid. However, the effectiveness diminishes significantly as the time between the intake and the 
administration of the agent increases. After 24 hours post-exposure, the usefulness of iodine thyroid 
blocking is negligible. 
Guidance on responding to personnel contamination can be found in REGDOC-2.7.1 [1]. Other 
approaches for responding to spills of radioiodines may be submitted to the CNSC for review and 
acceptance.  
E.3 
Instrument Selection 
The scintillation detector is currently the most common type of instrument used for measuring radioiodine 
in the thyroid. It typically consists of a probe (usually containing a sodium iodide (NaI) crystal) operated 
in conjunction with a counter and a spectrum analyzer.  
July 2021 
REGDOC-2.7.2, Dosimetry, Volume I: Ascertaining Occupational Dose 
 
70 
 
Systems can be as simple as a portable unit that produces results in counts per unit time, or as 
sophisticated as a gamma spectroscopy system that generates the energy spectrum of the isotope and then 
quantifies the total activity. Information on selecting a detector for I-125 or I-131 may be found in a 
number of references, such as in the Canadian Journal of Medical Radiation Technology article titled 
“Thyroid Monitoring Part VI: Choosing a Detector for Either I-125 and/or I-131” [32]. 
The NaI detector comes in various sizes and configurations depending on the desired use and sensitivity. 
When choosing a NaI detector, licensees should consider:  
 
the gamma energy of the radioiodine isotope to be measured  
 
the thickness of the NaI crystal  
 
the diameter of the NaI crystal  
 
the window material and configuration of the probe 
E.3.1 
Crystal thickness 
The thickness of the NaI crystal required varies depending on the isotope of radioiodine being measured. 
Detection and measurement of I-125 requires only a thin crystal to efficiently detect low-energy I-125 
photons. Typically, NaI crystals approximately 1 mm thick are used to measure low-energy photon 
emitters such as I-125.  
Conversely, a thicker crystal is required for the efficient detection of higher energy photons, from I-124 or 
I-131 for example. A crystal approximately 25 mm thick is recommended in these cases. 
Given the similarity in the energies of the gamma radiation emitted, the detector used for measurements 
of I-125 (thin crystal NaI) may be used for the detection and measurement of I-123. Similarly, the 
detector used for measurements of I-131 (thick crystal NaI) may be used for the detection and 
measurement of both I-123 and I-124. 
E.3.2 
Crystal diameter 
Another factor to consider is the diameter of the crystal. A large diameter results in greater overall 
counting efficiency. It also helps reduce errors that may result from any variances such as 
neck-to-detector distances, misalignment of detector with thyroid, and size of thyroid. However, a larger 
detector diameter increases the background reading. 
Window material of probe 
The window material of the probe is also a factor to be considered. The low-energy I-125 photons require 
a window material, such as Mylar or beryllium that is thin enough to allow the I-125 photons to penetrate 
the crystal.  
If a probe is required to detect both I-125 and I-131, the crystal should be thick enough to detect I-131 
and the window material thin enough to allow penetration of I-125.  
Table E.3 summarizes the recommended specifications for detector uses to measure isotopes of iodine.

Screening Method 
E.4.1 
Set-up 
To install a counting system: 
 
Set up the counting system in an area of low, or at least non-variable, background radiation.  
 
Ensure that the equipment is set up according to the manufacturer’s specifications.  
 
Determine the background count rate using a neck phantom (ideally containing potassium). 
 
Calibrate the system by following the procedure set out in section E.8.  
 
Calculate and record the count rate equivalent to 1 kBq and 10 kBq in the screening log (see section 
E.9 for a sample screening log).  
 
Verify the set-up every time the system or location is changed to confirm its adequacy or make 
appropriate modifications. 
 
E.4.2 
Quality control verifications 
To verify the ambient background and the reproducibility of the system’s count rate, the following steps 
should be taken on each day that thyroid screening is conducted: 
 
Measure and record the background count rate, accumulating at least 400 counts.  
 
Measure and record the net count rate of a standard source. 
 
Record the background and standard source count rates so that deviations from the norm can be 
readily observed (see section E.10 for a method of recording count rates using control charts). 
As a best practice, verify controls annually by participating in a thyroid intercomparison program such as 
the one provided by Health Canada and described in the Human Monitoring Laboratory technical report 
titled The Thyroid Intercomparison Program [33]. 
E.4.3 
Screening measurement 
To perform a screening measurement: 
1. Measure the person’s background count rate: 
a. 
this may be done by taking the measurement on the person’s lower thigh: although a thigh 
measurement simulates iodine that might be in the circulatory system, it should be noted that 
some detection equipment does not allow thigh measurements; in addition, thigh measurements 
may be affected by contamination of clothes or skin. 
b. 
if it is not feasible to carry out a background measurement on the thigh, an alternative method of 
measuring the background is to use a neck phantom (ideally containing potassium); if the 
background measurement is higher than usual, verify for possible contamination and repeat the 
measurement if necessary.  
July 2021 
REGDOC-2.7.2, Dosimetry, Volume I: Ascertaining Occupational Dose 
 
72 
 
2. Record the reading in the screening log. 
3. Measure the person’s count rate resulting from the thyroid. 
4. Record the reading in the screening log. 
5. Compare the result with the investigation and reporting levels recorded in the screening log.  
6. Depending on the measurement results, take the appropriate action based on the options provided in 
section E.6 and complete the screening log. 
E.5 
Monitoring Period 
Some CNSC licences stipulate the routine monitoring period for certain radioiodines, such as monitoring 
between 1 and 5 days after the last use of I-124, I-125 or I-131. In cases where the routine monitoring 
period is not specified in a licence condition, it should be selected based on the principles set out in 
section 7.1.5.  
E.6 
Validation of Screening Results 
E.6.1 
General level 
For all screening measurement results of I-124, I-125 or I-131 equal to or greater than 1 kBq, or screening 
measurement results of I-123 equal to or greater than 10 kBq, the licensee should proceed as follows: 
1. Verify that the screening measurement method described in section E.4.3 has been followed.  
2. If necessary, make any corrections and repeat the measurement. 
3. If the measurement result is still equal to or greater than 1 kBq, check clothes or skin for 
contamination.  
4. If clothes or skin are contaminated, remove the clothes or decontaminate the skin and repeat the 
measurement. 
5. If the measurement result is still equal to or greater than 1 kBq, ascertain and record the committed 
effective dose, and follow the steps in sections E.6.2 or E.6.3, as applicable.  
6. Screen all persons who worked in proximity to the person whose results are equal to or greater than 
1 kBq. 
E.6.2 
Investigation level 
For all screening measurement results of I-124, I-125 or I-131 equal to or greater than 1 kBq and less than 
10 kBq, or screening measurement results of I-123 equal to or greater than 100 kBq, the licensee should: 
1. validate the results as per section E.6.1  
2. perform an internal investigation to determine and correct the cause of the screening results  
3. record the findings  
4. correct any deficiencies found by the investigation  
5. record the event in the annual compliance report 
E.6.3 
Reporting level  
For I-124, I-125 and I-131, a 10 kBq thyroid screening result is approximately equal to a committed 
effective dose of 1 mSv. This is also the case for an I-123 screening result of 100 kBq. Under section 16 
of the RPR, the CNSC must be notified when a licensee becomes aware that a dose to a person may have 
July 2021 
REGDOC-2.7.2, Dosimetry, Volume I: Ascertaining Occupational Dose 
 
73 
 
exceeded an applicable dose limit. For NEWs, the effective dose from each component of the dose that 
contributes more than 1 mSv per year should be ascertained. 
For all screening measurement results of I-124, I-125 or I-131 equal to or greater than 10 kBq, or of I-123 
equal to or greater than 100 kBq, the licensee should: 
1. validate the results as per section E.6.1  
2. immediately inform the CNSC if the measurement was made on a person other than a NEW  
3. have a radioiodine bioassay performed by an organization that has passed the relevant Health Canada 
intercomparison test in the previous 12 months or, if such an organization is unavailable, seek CNSC 
approval to permit someone else to perform the radioiodine bioassay  
4. use the results of the bioassay to ascertain the committed effective dose  
5. perform an internal investigation to determine and correct the cause of the screening results, including 
area and contamination monitoring at the site of the radioiodine intake, if applicable  
6. record the event in the annual compliance report 
 
E.6.4 
Screening log 
The licensee should maintain a thyroid screening log. An example is provided in section E.9. 
E.7 
Volatile Radioiodine Compounds 
Volatile radioiodine compounds include such compounds as sodium iodide (NaI) and radioiodines in a 
disassociated form. The volatility of radioiodine compounds may increase as a result of acidifying or 
freezing.  
Activities that may cause radioiodine to be released include opening stock reagent containers, opening 
packages containing capsules used for therapeutic or diagnostic purposes, and working with such open 
packages. Therefore, capsules given to patients for diagnostic tests or for therapeutic purposes are 
considered to contain radioiodine in volatile radioiodine form. 
The addition of antioxidants, such as sodium thiosulfate, to either labelled or NaI solutions reduces both 
decomposition and volatility. Furthermore, maintaining radioiodine solutions at dilute concentrations 
minimizes radiolytic decomposition. It should also be noted that radioimmunoassay kits contain small 
quantities of I-125 in a non-volatile form. 
E.8 
Instrument Calibration 
E.8.1 
General 
All equipment and instruments used for thyroid screening should be maintained in good operating 
condition and must be calibrated as per section 25 of the RPR. Calibration must be performed for the 
isotope of interest under conditions mimicking the thyroid in the neck. An example of a calibration 
procedure can be found in “Thyroid Monitoring Part III: A Basic Calibration Procedure for Thyroid 
Monitoring” [34]. Once set up (as per section E.4.1), the measurement equipment must be calibrated if a 
quality control measurement is outside the control limits, as described in section E.10. In addition, the 
measurement equipment must be recalibrated prior to being put back into service if it has undergone any 
significant changes, such as repair or replacement that may have an adverse impact on the precision, 
accuracy or reliability of the measurements.

REGDOC-2.7.2, Dosimetry, Volume I: Ascertaining Occupational Dose 
 
74 
 
E.8.2 
Detector efficiency 
To determine absolute detector efficiency, measure the activity of a traceable standard source of the 
isotope of interest and use the following formula: 
(28) 
E = (C – B)/A 
Where:  
E = the efficiency in counts per second (cps) per becquerel (Bq)  
C = the measured counts per unit time of the standard source, in cps  
B = the background count rate, in cps  
A = the known activity of the standard source, traceable to a national standardizing laboratory within 
5% (2σ, or standard deviation) accuracy, in Bq. 
The licensee should ensure that if a short-lived standard source is used (e.g., I-131), the activity of the 
source is corrected for decay to the day on which the calibration is performed. Appropriate, longer-lived, 
surrogate standard sources include: Te-123m (for I-123), Cs-137 (for I-124), I-129 (for I-125) and Ba-133 
(for I-131). 
The instrument and measurement parameters used to determine counting efficiency should be the same as 
those used for routine screening. Placing the detector as close to the thyroid as possible achieves the 
greatest efficiency. However, because of variations in thyroid depth, size, shape and positioning, large 
uncertainties can be introduced into the activity estimate. Such errors can be reduced by increasing the 
distance between the neck and the detector. Each system has its own optimal compromise between high 
efficiency and error reduction, but generally a good neck-to-detector distance is 12 cm. 
The licensee should ensure a long enough count time for both the standard source and the background 
count rate so that overall error (2σ) in the count is less than 5%. This means approximately 400 gross 
counts for the background measurement. 
E.8.3 
Minimum detectable activity 
The licensee should conduct measurements to achieve a minimum detectable activity (MDA) that is less 
than 1 kBq. The MDA is described in section 7.2.5. When the sample and background count times are 
equal, the MDA formula shown in section 7.2.5 reduces to the formula below: 
(29) 
𝑀𝐷𝐴= 4.66√𝐵+ 2.71
𝐸𝑇
 
Where: 
B = the total background counts collected during time T  
E = the efficiency in cps/Bq  
T = the time in seconds 
July 2021 
REGDOC-2.7.2, Dosimetry, Volume I: Ascertaining Occupational Dose 
 
75 
 
Equation 29 applies when the subject and background count times are equal. When they are not equal, 
equation 11 should be used instead. 
E.8.4 
Sample MDA calculation 
If a system’s MDA is not low enough – either because of a low efficiency or high background – it can be 
improved. This can be done by increasing the counting time used for the measurement, decreasing the 
background, or both. 
As an example, consider I-125. Assuming that the efficiency is 0.0060 cps/Bq and the gross background 
count is 400 counts, a 300-second count time would result in the following MDA, using the equation in 
section E.8.3: 
(30) 
𝑀𝐷𝐴= 4.66√𝐵+ 2.71
𝐸𝑇
 
 
𝑀𝐷𝐴= 4.66√400 + 2.71
(0,0060)(300)  
 
𝑀𝐷𝐴= 53 𝐵𝑞 
The resulting value, 53 Bq, is acceptable for I-125. 
The counting time used to monitor personnel does not have to be as long as that used for calibration. In 
the example above, the background is 400 counts/300 seconds, or 1.3 cps. Assuming the background 
count rate is stable, a 60-second count time would result in approximately 80 counts. Substituting these 
new figures into the equation produces a new MDA value, as shown in the following formula: 
(31) 
𝑀𝐷𝐴= 4.66√80 + 2.71
(0,0060)(60)  
 
𝑀𝐷𝐴= 124 𝐵𝑞 
E.8.5 
Records 
Accurate calibration and service records should be maintained for the measurement system. The records 
should contain the following information: 
1. calibration date  
2. reference method  
3. calibration source current activity  
4. background values (these should be compared with previous values to detect changes)  
5. MDA  
6. calculated efficiency  
7. authorization signature

Quality Control Charts 
This section provides a method for recording background and standard source count rates for quality 
control verifications. 
Prepare 2 control charts, one for each of the background and standard source quality control verifications 
described in section E.4.2. Each control chart should show the date that measurements were taken and the 
corresponding count rates. After approximately 20 days of counting operations, there will be enough 
observations to estimate the standard deviations for the distributions. The standard deviation can be 
estimated in the following equation: 
(32) 
𝑆= ඩ
1
𝑛−1 ෍(𝑁௜−𝑁
ഥ)ଶ
௡
௜ୀଵ
 
Where: 
S = the standard deviation  
n = the number of either background or standard source measurements  
Ni = the count rate of each individual measurement  
N  = the average of n measurements of Ni 
The licensee should draw control limits at ±2S on each chart. Nearly all the quality control measurements 
(95%) should lie within the control limits. 
If a quality control measurement of the background or standard source is outside the control limits, repeat 
the measurement immediately. If the repeated measurement is also outside the limits, verify the 
instrument settings. Lastly, if no cause can be found, the licensee may need to take remedial action, 
including recalibrating or repairing the instruments to ensure that subsequent quality control 
measurements are within the control limits.

Appendix F: Radionuclide-Specific Recommendations Related to Bioassay 
Measurements and Internal Dosimetry – Uranium 
F.1 
Annual Limits on Intake of Uranium Compounds 
Natural uranium contains 3 isotopes: U-234, U-235 and U-238. Their respective activities per gram of 
natural uranium are 12,430 Bq, 575.9 Bq and 12, 350Bq. The mass percentages are 99.2742%, 0.7204% 
and 0.0054% for U-238, U-235 and U-234, respectively, and the specific activity is 2.54  104 Bq g-1, as 
outlined in ICRP Publication 107, Nuclear Decay Data for Dosimetric Calculations [35], and in the 
National Institute of Standards and Technology’s Atomic Weights and Isotopic Compositions database 
[36]. This section presents guidance on the selection of appropriate annual limits on intake (ALIs) for 
various uranium compounds, including those that have been enriched or depleted in the U-235 content. 
The committed effective dose per unit intake (dose coefficients) and the corresponding ALIs for the 
inhalation of uranium compounds should be calculated for the solubility characteristics of those 
compounds to which workers may be exposed in the workplace. When no such material-specific dose 
coefficients and ALIs are available, the values from table F.1 should be used. Data for table F.1 was 
sourced from CNSC-RSP-0297, Evaluation of Default Annual Limit on Intake (ALI) for Yellowcake and 
Uranium Ore [37].

Material-specific ALIs should be derived from in vitro solubility studies of the relevant compounds. The 
study methodology and results should be documented as part of the licensee’s dosimetry technical basis. 
The solubility study should be updated periodically to reflect changes in processes or types of compounds 
encountered at the licensed facility, or to verify that solubility parameters have not changed. 
F.2 
Chemical Toxicity of Uranium Compounds 
Because uranium is a heavy metal, it is chemically toxic above a threshold concentration in the kidneys. 
Chemical toxicity should be considered when inhalation intakes of soluble uranium compounds, and 
intakes by ingestion as well as via wounds, are likely. In order to prevent uranium from affecting the 
kidneys, urine bioassay measurements should be used to verify that the concentration of uranium does not 
exceed the peak kidney burden. The peak kidney burden should be established between 0.3 to a maximum 
of 3 μg of uranium per gram of kidney tissue. For further information, consult ISO 16638-1, Radiological 
Protection – Monitoring and Internal Dosimetry for Specific Materials – Part 1: Inhalation of Uranium 
Compounds [38]. Table F.2 shows urinary concentrations resulting from a peak kidney burden of 3 μg of 
uranium per gram of kidney tissue. The concentrations are averages for the 24-hour period listed. For the 
time period of 1 day, the concentration is the average for the period from time 0 to 24 hours following the

hours following an intake. Data for tables F.2 and F.3 was sourced from CNSC-RSP-0165, Uranium

When a worker’s urine monitoring result exceeds the applicable value from table F.2 or F.3, the worker 
should be removed from work involving soluble uranium compounds, and an additional urine sample 
should be obtained to confirm the initial result. If the intake is confirmed, the worker should be referred to 
medical personnel for a kidney function test. 
The dominant mode of uranium toxicity depends on the compound solubility, the U-235 enrichment, and 
the presence of other uranium isotopes. 
Chemical toxicity is limiting in the following conditions: 
 
acute inhalation intakes of Type F compounds of all U-235 enrichments 
 
acute inhalation intakes of Type M compounds of U-235 enrichments less than 30% by mass 
 
chronic inhalation intakes of Type F compounds of U-235 enrichments less than 3% by mass 
Radiological toxicity is limiting in the following conditions: 
 
acute or chronic inhalation intakes of Type S compounds of any U-235 enrichment 
 
acute or chronic inhalation intakes of any absorption type when U-232 or U-236 is present 
 
chronic inhalation intakes of Type F compounds of U-235 enrichments of 3% or more by mass 
 
chronic inhalation intakes of Type M compounds of any U-235 enrichment 
Chemical and radiological toxicity are equivalent for acute inhalation intakes of Type M compounds with 
U-235 enrichments of 30% or more by mass. In cases of intakes via a wound, the radiological and 
chemical toxicity should both be assessed on a case-by-case basis. For further information, consult ISO 
16638-1, Radiological Protection – Monitoring and Internal Dosimetry for Specific Materials – Part 1: 
Inhalation of Uranium Compounds [38]. 
F.3 
Ascertaining Dose From Intakes of Uranium Compounds 
In addition to the recommendations in Part B of this regulatory document, the following should be 
considered when ascertaining the dose from intakes of uranium compounds. 
F.3.1 
In vitro bioassay 
Measurements of uranium in urine samples should be used to: 
 
ascertain doses from intakes of soluble uranium compounds 
 
serve as an indicator of intakes for uranium compounds of any solubility 
 
verify that intakes calculated from air monitoring are representative of actual intakes 
 
supplement in vivo monitoring data in special bioassay monitoring to ascertain the dose 
 
verify the proper functioning of respiratory protective equipment  
F.3.2 
In vivo bioassay 
In vivo bioassay monitoring for intakes of uranium consists of lung counting. The following should be 
considered when measuring uranium in the lungs. 
Measurements of the chest wall thickness (CWT) should be carried out for every worker taking part in a 
lung counting program for uranium. The measurements may be made by ultrasound. The frequency of 
these measurements should be documented. Calibration of the ultrasound units used for CWT 
measurements should be documented and verified periodically. The CWT of every worker taking part in a 
July 2021 
REGDOC-2.7.2, Dosimetry, Volume I: Ascertaining Occupational Dose 
 
80 
 
lung counting program should be documented and updated periodically. Each worker’s CWT should be 
used in ascertaining their lung burden (e.g., mg of uranium) from the lung counting results. 
Triggers for repeating lung counts should be established and documented. These should be based on 
considerations of surface contamination of counted workers. When surface contamination has been 
confirmed on a worker such that their lung count results are inaccurate, the worker should be asked to 
shower and then be recounted.

Appendix G: Radionuclide-Specific Recommendations Related to Air Monitoring and 
Internal Dosimetry – Radon progeny 
G.1 
Introduction 
Radon is a naturally occurring radioactive noble gas. There exist several isotopes of radon; however, the 
most significant in terms of occupation dose is Rn-222, which is part of the U-238 decay chain. The 
majority of the dose from inhaled Rn-222 results from the decay of its short-lived progeny. The focus of 
this appendix is on ascertaining worker doses from inhaled Rn-222 and its short-lived progeny. 
Occupational intakes of other isotopes of radon, such as Rn-220, are not covered in this appendix because 
they do not contribute significantly to worker doses in modern Canadian uranium mines. Guidance on the 
topic, however, can be found in ICRP Publication 65, Protection Against Radon-222 at Home and at 
Work [40]. Figure G.1 shows the U-238 decay chain, and highlights the Rn-222 short-lived radioactive 
progeny. 
Figure G.1: The U-238 decay chain 
 
The potential alpha energy exposure (PAEE) is the time integral of the potential alpha energy 
concentration in air, to which an individual is exposed over a given time period. The potential alpha 
energy concentration is the concentration of short-lived Rn-222 progeny in air in terms of the alpha 
energy released during the complete decay through Po-214. The PAEE is expressed in working level 
months WLM and derived as described in section G.3.

G.2 
Dose Coefficients for Radon Progeny 
The effective dose conversion factors of 5 mSv/WLM for NEWs and 4 mSv/WLM for persons who are 
not NEWs are derived based on the detriment of radon progeny per unit effective dose, as defined by the 
ICRP 65[40]. For workers, this value is 5.6 × 10-5 Sv-1, and for the public it is 7.3 × 10-5 Sv-1 [41]. For 
both workers and the public, the detriment per PAEE is 2.83 × 10-4 WLM-1 [40]. The ratio of the 
detriment per PAEE to the detriment per unit effective dose results in the effective dose conversion 
factors. 
To calculate the dose to NEWs, from their PAEE in WLM, which is calculated through air monitoring, 
the PAEE should be multiplied by 5 mSv/WLM to obtain the effective dose. To calculate the dose to 
persons who are not NEWs, from their PAEE in WLM, the PAEE should be multiplied by 4 mSv/WLM 
to obtain the effective dose. 
G.3 
Measuring the Concentration of Radon Progeny and Deriving the PAEE 
A representative volume of air should be sampled to measure the airborne radon progeny concentration, 
either on an instantaneous or continuous basis. Instantaneous samples are typically those collected over 
short intervals of a few minutes. Continuous samples are those collected over much longer time intervals, 
typically hours or days. 
One radon progeny measurement approach acceptable to the CNSC is the modified Kusnetz method. It 
consists of: 
 
filtering a representative volume of air to collect a sample of airborne radon progeny 
 
measuring the alpha emissions that occur during radioactive decay of the collected progeny 
 
using observed, measured and known data, and established formulae, to estimate the atmospheric 
concentration of radon progeny at the time of sampling 
The method consists of initially collecting a sample of airborne radon progeny by using a portable air 
pump to draw air through a low-porosity filter. The radon progeny that are present in the air attach to the 
inlet face of the filter used. These progeny subsequently decay, emitting alpha particles and other forms of 
radiation in the process. During this decay, the emissions of alpha particles are detected and counted, 
using an instrument (an alpha counter) designed and manufactured for that purpose. 
The counting results obtained are then used along with other pertinent data and observations to estimate 
the concentration, in units called working levels (WLs). The concentration of radon progeny is calculated 
from the alpha disintegrations per WL over the interval between the end of sampling and the middle of 
alpha counting. It considers the volume of air sampled, the alpha activity of collected and resultant radon 
progeny, the efficiency and background of the alpha counter, and the absorption characteristics of the 
filter used during sampling. 
Air sampling locations should be selected to accurately reflect the conditions to be assessed. 
Non-representative or adverse sampling conditions, such as areas of turbulent air flow (e.g., duct 
exhausts, junctures or intersections of ventilation passageways, door or window openings) should be 
avoided. When collecting radon progeny samples for the purpose of estimating or confirming radiation 
doses to workers, the actual atmospheres breathed by the respective workers should be sampled where 
possible. Such samples may be collected, for example, at the individuals’ workstations over a 
representative period. Alternatively, if concentrations of airborne radon progeny are similar over a large 
area, it may suffice to collect representative samples while moving through the area, or at appropriate

REGDOC-2.7.2, Dosimetry, Volume I: Ascertaining Occupational Dose 
 
83 
 
points within the area. The latter approach may be particularly appropriate within uranium processing 
plants and in travel ways and/or similar areas of mines. 
Samples that are intended to aid in the planning, development and evaluation of engineering works and 
production processes should be representative of the conditions that they are intended to assess. 
Accordingly, these samples should be collected at appropriate locations and times. For example, to 
determine the impact of modifications to mine or building ventilation systems, or to guide the installation 
of such systems, it may be necessary to collect several air samples at multiple locations before, after and 
during the changes. 
G.4 
Ascertaining Doses from Radon Gas 
The effective dose resulting from the inhalation of Rn-222 gas alone may be ascertained by multiplying 
the Rn-222 intake by the effective dose coefficient. It may also be ascertained by multiplying the Rn-222 
concentration by the occupancy time and the effective dose rate per unit concentration factor. This factor 
is the effective dose rate due to a chronic exposure to a concentration of 1 Bq/m3 of Rn-222 gas, once the 
radon has reached equilibrium in organs and tissues. The recommended values for these parameters, as 
well as the ALI, are presented in table G.1 [42].
