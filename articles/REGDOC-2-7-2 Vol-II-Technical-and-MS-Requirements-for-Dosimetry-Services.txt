Technical and Management System Requirements for Dosimetry Services 
1. 
Introduction 
1.1 
Purpose 
Regulatory document REGDOC-2.7.2, Dosimetry, Volume II: Technical and Management System 
Requirements for Dosimetry Services, sets out requirements and guidance for licensed dosimetry services. 
These requirements and guidance are to help ensure that dosimetry results are accurate, repeatable, 
verifiable and properly recorded, in accordance with the purpose of the Nuclear Safety and Control Act 
(NSCA) and the Radiation Protection Regulations. 
1.2 
Scope 
This regulatory document sets out the technical and management system requirements for a 
dosimetry service licensed by the CNSC. 
1.3 
Relevant legislation 
The following provisions of the Nuclear Safety and Control Act (NSCA) and the regulations made under 
it are relevant to this document: 
 
Subsection 24(4) of the NSCA provides that “No licence shall be issued, renewed, amended or 
replaced - and no authorization to transfer one given - unless, in the opinion of the Commission, the 
applicant or, in the case of an application for an authorization to transfer the licence, the transferee  
(a)  is qualified to carry on the activity that the licence will authorize the licensee to carry on; and 
(b) will, in carrying on that activity, make adequate provision for the protection of the environment, 
the health and safety of persons and the maintenance of national security and measures required to 
implement international obligations to which Canada has agreed.”  
 
Subsection 24(5) of the NSCA states that a licence may contain any term or condition that the 
Commission considers necessary for the purposes of the Act.  
 
Section 18 of the Radiation Protection Regulations (RPR) lists the information that is required for an 
application for a licence to operate a dosimetry service. 
 
Section 19 of the RPR lists the information that the licensee of a dosimetry service must supply to the 
National Dose Registry for each nuclear energy worker.  
 
Subection 28(1) of the General Nuclear Safety and Control Regulations (GNSCR), states that “Every 
person who is required to keep a record by the Act, the regulations made under the Act or a licence 
shall retain the record for the period specified in the applicable regulations made under the Act or, if 
no period is specified in the regulations, for the period ending one year after the expiry of the licence 
that authorizes the activity in respect of which the records are kept.”  
 
Subsection 28(2) of the GNSCR states that “No person shall dispose of a record referred to in the Act, 
the regulations made under the Act or a licence unless the person  
a)  is no longer required to keep the record by the Act, the regulations made under the Act or the 
licence; and

b)  has notified the Commission of the date of disposal and of the nature of the record at least 90 days 
before the date of disposal.” 
2. 
Technical Requirements – Dosimetry Services for External Radiation 
Requirements that apply to neutron dosimetry services are described in section 3. 
An external dosimetry service shall comply with the following requirements: 
1. Identify, at the licensing stage, the types of radiation and the expected respective energy ranges to 
which the dosimeters will be exposed during use. 
2. Measure the quantity of interest within the accuracy specifications and uncertainty limits that apply to 
that quantity, as described in section 2.3, Accuracy specifications and uncertainty limits. 
3. Demonstrate its ability to satisfy overall specifications through type testing at the licensing stage and 
when changes are made, as described in section 2.4, Type testing. 
4. Demonstrate that it operates in a predictable and consistent way through routine and special 
performance testing, as described in section 2.5, Performance testing.  
5. Have its performance and the calibration of its system verified through independent testing, as 
described in section 2.6, Independent testing. 
6. Notify the CNSC immediately, in writing (electronic format acceptable), when it fails one of its 
periodic tests (i.e., performance or independent test).  
7. Within 30 days, submit a detailed written report to the CNSC outlining the cause and consequence of 
any periodic test failure and a description of corrective action taken. 
8. Repeat the test as soon as practicable in consultation with the CNSC, and submit the results to the 
CNSC.  
If repetition of the test results in a second consecutive failure, the CNSC may take further licensing 
action.  
2.1 
Measurement quantities 
2.1.1 
Torso 
The quantity to be measured is the “personal dose equivalent,” Hp(d), as defined by the International 
Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements in Report 47 [1]. The values of d differ depending on 
tissue depth, as follows: 
1. d = 0.07 mm for a shallow (or skin) dose  
2. d = 10 mm for a deep (or whole-body) dose  
The conventionally true value of d serves as the reference value for estimating errors in measurements. In 
the following sections, Hp,c(d) designates the conventionally true value of the quantity Hp(d). For more 
information on conventionally true values, see section A.2, Conventionally true value. 
2.1.2 
Extremities 
The quantity to be measured for a specific extremity is the dose equivalent at a depth of 0.07 mm, which 
is designated as He for the purpose of this document. In the following sections, He,c designates the 
August 2020 
REGDOC-2.7.2, Dosimetry, Volume II: 
 
Technical and Management System Requirements for Dosimetry Services 
 
 
3 
 
 
conventionally true value of the quantity He. For more information on conventionally true values, see 
section A.2, Conventionally true value. 
2.2 
Minimum measurable dose equivalent 
The dosimetry service shall determine the lowest values of Hp,c(d) and He,c that it can measure at the 95% 
confidence level. These values shall be determined under good laboratory conditions, using the usual 
calibration radiation at normal incidence to the dosimeter. 
The method used to determine these quantities is left to the discretion of the dosimetry service. However, 
the reference used shall be indicated in the licence application. 
2.3 
Accuracy specifications and uncertainty limits 
Table 1 lists the overall specifications for accuracy and precision. Type testing (which is described in 
section 2.4, Type testing, and appendix B, Type Test Specifications for External Dosimetry) determines a 
dosimetry system’s ability to meet these specifications. Section A.3, Accuracy and Precision, describes 
the calculation methods for analyzing type test results. Section A.4 provides example calculations.

2.4 
Type testing 
The dosimetry service shall comply with the following requirements: 
1. Demonstrate the ability of its dosimetry system to satisfy overall specification requirements through 
type testing at the licence application stage.  
2. Repeat the type tests when the dosimetry service makes changes that may affect the result of a dose 
measurement to the extent necessary to demonstrate that the specifications of table 1 (section 2.3, 
Accuracy specifications and uncertainty limits), continue to be met. Examples of such changes are 
dosimeter design, badge case filters, dose algorithm, and temperature cycles (for thermoluminescent 
dosimetry). 
3. Report the results of these type tests which have been repeated following changes made to the system, 
to the CNSC, along with the records described in section 2.4.1, Documentation, and obtain CNSC 
approval prior to the implementation of these changes. 
4. Comply with the specifications described in appendix B, Type Test Specifications for External 
Dosimetry.

2.4.1 
Documentation 
The dosimetry service shall maintain: 
1. Type test results in a format that clearly shows all the influence quantities and system characteristics 
that were considered and their range of possible values, as expected by the dosimetry service, based 
on the intended use of that particular dosimetry system. 
2. Sample calculations that show how the mean response and the combined standard uncertainty were 
calculated. 
3. The justification for any assumptions made and techniques used. 
2.5 
Performance testing 
2.5.1 
Routine performance tests 
The dosimetry service shall conduct routine performance tests. The dosimetry service shall include 
provisions for routine performance tests during every routine dosimeter issue period.  
In the case of biweekly issue periods, the test should be completed at least monthly. However, licensees 
may propose an alternative frequency for routine performance tests of dosimeters that are used in 
biweekly issue periods. For extremity dosimetry, performance tests shall be conducted at least once every 
three months. For routine performance tests, the dosimetry service shall comply with the following 
requirements: 
1. Irradiate test dosimeters to known doses, usually under standard exposure conditions (e.g., at normal 
incidence with the calibration radiation). 
2. Treat test dosimeters in the same way as routine dosimeters; if processing is required, provide test 
dosimeters without identifying them to the processing laboratory. 
3. In test irradiations, include doses comparable to or less than the smaller values in table 1 (section 2.3, 
Accuracy specifications and uncertainty limits). 
4. Demonstrate compliance with the control limits set out in table 2 (section 2.6.1, Accuracy 
specifications). The licensee may propose alternate control limits to the CNSC for review and 
approval. 
The dosimetry service may maintain constant irradiation conditions and doses over time to permit more 
valid trend analysis.  
2.5.2 
Special performance tests 
In addition to the routine performance tests, the dosimetry service shall conduct special performance tests, 
at a minimum of every five years from the date of initial licensing, to confirm that the performance of the 
dosimetry system remains consistent with the results of the most recent CNSC-approved type tests. The 
five-year period may be amended up to ten years to align with the term of the licence. The frequency and 
nature of special performance tests shall be specified in the licence application. 
For special performance tests, the dosimetry service should subject the dosimeters to a subset of those 
influence quantities that the type tests showed to be significant and to which the response of the dosimetry 
system may have changed as a result of aging or replacement of components.  
August 2020 
REGDOC-2.7.2, Dosimetry, Volume II: 
 
Technical and Management System Requirements for Dosimetry Services

The results should be presented in a manner that is consistent with the most recent CNSC-approved type 
test results and should indicate that the accuracy and specification requirements outlined in table 1 
(section 2.3) are met. 
2.5.3 
Documentation 
The dosimetry service shall keep a record of the following information: 
1. routine performance test procedures 
2. routine and special performance test results 
The dosimetry service shall submit the routine performance test procedures to the CNSC for approval. 
2.6 
Independent testing 
The requirements for independent testing include the following: 
1. External dosimetry services shall undergo and pass independent testing of each of its dosimeter 
designs.  
2. Upon receipt of a licence, the dosimetry service shall undergo independent testing at regular intervals 
with a frequency of at least once every 12 months. 
3. The dosimetry service shall have the independent tests performed by the relevant reference calibration 
centre for external dosimetry in Canada (see appendix J) or another recognized national or 
international laboratory, in consultation with the CNSC.  
4. The dosimetry service shall comply with the specifications described in appendix C, Independent Test 
Specifications for External Photon Dosimetry, and appendix D, Independent Test Specifications for 
Extremity Dosimetry, as applicable. 
5. If the dosimeters used by the dosimetry service require processing (e.g., thermoluminescent 
dosimeters [TLDs]), and more than one processing unit (e.g., TLD reader) is used, each processing 
unit shall be tested annually by using each unit to process at least one set of test dosimeters irradiated 
by the reference calibration centre.  
Note: If the dosimetry service has documented evidence that shows that all of its processing units respond 
in a consistent manner, only one unit shall be tested annually through the reference calibration centre. 
However, the dosimetry service shall establish response consistency of the processing units by showing 
that the mean response (i.e., the mean calculated dose) of a set of dosimeters processed by any given unit 
is within ±5% (at the 95% confidence level) of the average of the mean responses obtained from all of the 
processing units. For whole-body dosimeters, the coefficient of variation of dosimeters processed by each 
unit shall not be greater than 0.075, and for extremity dosimeters, the coefficient of variation of 
dosimeters processed by each unit shall not be greater than 0.2. 
2.6.1 
Accuracy specifications 
The accuracy specifications that a dosimetry service shall maintain in each of the independent tests for 
photon and beta radiation are represented in table 2 by the mean response 
 
R and by the coefficient of 
variation of the responses for the complete set of measurements. For dosimeters worn on the torso, the 
mean response corresponds with the complete set of measurements of the collision air kermas (or 
exposures) delivered. For dosimeters worn on the extremities, the mean response corresponds with the 
complete set of measurements of tissue doses delivered.

3. 
Technical Requirements – Neutron Dosimetry Services 
A neutron dosimetry service shall comply with the following requirements: 
1. Ensure compatibility between the dosimetry service’s neutron dosimeters and the neutron fields in 
which they are to be used, and where possible, include a description of the neutron sources and the 
expected neutron spectra to which workers will be exposed.  
2. Document detailed technical descriptions of the dosimeters and associated equipment. 
3. Record data and prepare reports with quantitative information on the performance of the dosimeters 
and the service (type testing is not required, except to show that the response is appropriate to the 
neutron energy spectra to which workers may be exposed). 
4. Have the calibration of its system directly traceable to the reference calibration centre (see 
appendix J) or another recognized national or international laboratory, in consultation with the CNSC. 
If neutron survey meters are used instead of personal neutron dosimeters, the dosimetry service shall meet 
the requirements listed above regarding such instruments. It shall also establish a routine calibration 
program with the relevant reference calibration centre (see appendix J) or another recognized national or 
international laboratory, in consultation with the CNSC. 
3.1 
Data and reports 
Further to item 3 in section 3, the following information shall be recorded as data and provided in reports: 
1. A description of the calibration source, the calibration field and a reference to the calibration protocol  
2. The dose equivalent energy response of the dosimeters  
3. A statement on the limitations of the dosimetry system and a qualitative estimate of its accuracy and 
precision in measuring Hp,c(10), under the conditions that the dosimeters are intended to be used, 
including the variability among the processing components  
4. An estimate of the lowest value of Hp,c(10) that the dosimetry system is capable of measuring at the 
95% confidence level

Independent testing 
Prior to licensing, the dosimetry service shall undergo independent testing with the relevant reference 
calibration centre (see appendix J) or another recognized national or international laboratory, in 
consultation with the CNSC. Upon receipt of a licence, the independent testing shall occur at regular 
intervals with a frequency of at least once every 12 months.

This is a consistency test that enables dosimetry services to demonstrate consistency of performance on a 
periodic basis. The conditions upon which the consistency will be judged are established at the time of 
licensing. Table 3 shows the pass criteria for the complete set of measurements.

When neutron survey meters are used for dosimetry, the requirement for an annual independent test may 
be combined with the requirement described in section 3, Technical Requirements – Neutron Dosimetry 
Services, for routine calibration. It is sufficient to send one neutron survey meter for such a test, providing 
that any additional neutron survey meters used by the dosimetry service are calibrated against the one sent 
to the reference calibration centre. 
The dosimetry service shall comply with the specifications described in appendix E, Independent Test 
Specifications for Neutron Dosimetry. 
3.3 
Performance testing 
The dosimetry service shall comply with the following requirements: 
1. Establish a program for routine performance tests on the dosimetry systems.  
2. Include provisions for routine performance tests during every routine dosimeter issue period. In the 
case of biweekly issue periods or the use of survey instruments for dose assessment, the test should be 
completed at least monthly. 
3. Submit relevant documentation, including the frequency of the testing, to the CNSC at the licence 
application stage.

Documentation 
The neutron doses shall be recorded and reported separately from other types of doses.

Technical Requirements – Dosimetry Services for Internal Radiation 
An internal dosimetry service shall comply with the following requirements: 
1. Measure the activities and activity concentrations for selected radionuclides, as described in 
section 4.1, Measurement quantities.  
2. Measure the quantity of interest within the accuracy and precision specifications, as described in 
section 4.2, In vitro accuracy and precision specifications, and section 4.5, In vivo accuracy and 
precision specifications. 
3. Demonstrate that the internal dosimetry service operates in a predictable and consistent way through 
performance testing, as described in section 4.3, Performance testing for in vitro measurements. 
4. Demonstrate that it operates in a reliable way by participating in independent testing, as described in 
section 4.4, Independent testing for in vitro measurements, and section 4.6, Independent testing for in 
vivo measurements.  
5. Ascertain doses as described in section 4.7.1, Ascertaining the committed effective dose. 
6. Notify the CNSC immediately, in writing (electronic format acceptable), when it fails one of its 
periodic tests (i.e., performance or independent test).

7. Within 30 days, submit a detailed written report to the CNSC outlining the cause and consequence of 
the failure of any periodic test and a description of corrective actions taken. 
8. Repeat any failed test as soon as practicable in consultation with the CNSC and submit the results to 
the CNSC.  
If a repetition of the test results in a second consecutive failure, the CNSC may take further licensing 
action. 
4.1 
Measurement quantities 
Licensed internal dosimetry services are intended to support radiation protection programs; therefore, this 
document does not cover requirements regarding the dosimetry service’s detection capabilities (e.g., 
minimum detectable activity).  
The internal dosimetry service shall participate in independent tests involving quantities, activities or 
activity concentrations equal to or greater than the minimum testing levels (MTLs) shown in table 4 [2, 3] 
for the radionuclides for which they are licensed. This does not preclude the dosimetry service from 
carrying out its performance tests at levels below the MTLs. The list of radionuclides in table 4 is not 
comprehensive for fission and activation products, but is representative for demonstrating competence in 
measurement techniques. MTLs for other radionuclides not listed in table 4 may be developed in 
consultation with the CNSC. 
To simulate working conditions, radionuclides other than those listed in table 4 may be introduced during 
the required independent testing described in section 4.4, Independent testing for in vitro measurements, 
and section 4.6, Independent testing for in vivo measurements. These radionuclides are considered 
separate from the test, but are added as interferences to challenge the service’s analytical system. 
Consequently, the dosimetry service may pass the test without identifying or measuring them. However, 
failure to correct for such interferences would jeopardize performance of the test and may result in a 
failed test.

The relative precision, SB, is a measure of the reproducibility of an analysis, as expressed in the following 
equation: 
𝑆𝐵= 𝑠
𝐴 
Where s is the standard deviation of a series of measurements of a variable with a known true value, A. 
Since bias is often greater at lower concentrations near the limits of detection than at higher 
concentrations, dosimetry service laboratories shall be tested at several concentrations no lower than the 
MTL. The in vitro accuracy and precision specifications for independent and performance tests are such 
that the root mean squared error (RMSE) of B and SB must be less than or equal to 0.25, as follows: 
𝑅𝑀𝑆𝐸= √𝐵2 + 𝑆𝐵
2  ≤0.25 
In the above expression, B is the mean relative bias, and SB is the relative precision [2]. 
4.3 
Performance testing for in vitro measurements 
The dosimetry service shall conduct routine performance tests. It shall include provisions for routine 
performance tests for in vitro bioassay, which are to be performed at least once every three months, or, for 
infrequently used in vitro measurements, at a frequency determined in consultation with the CNSC. 
For routine performance tests, the dosimetry service shall comply with the following requirements: 
1. Prepare the test samples to concentrations of analyte not known to the person analyzing the test 
samples. 
2. Determine the concentration of analyte in the test samples. 
3. Treat the test samples in the same way as routine in vitro bioassay samples, so that the two are 
indistinguishable. 
4. Include the same categories of radionuclides in the performance tests that are included in the 
independent tests in which the dosimetry service participates. 
4.3.1 
Documentation 
The dosimetry service shall keep records of performance test procedures and performance test results. 
The dosimetry service shall submit the performance test procedures to the CNSC for approval at the 
licence application stage. 
4.4 
Independent testing for in vitro measurements 
Internal dosimetry services shall undergo and pass independent testing prior to licensing. Upon receipt of 
a licence, the dosimetry service shall undergo independent testing at regular intervals at least every 
12 months, or at other intervals determined in consultation with the CNSC. 
If a dosimetry service uses more than one measurement instrument (e.g., several liquid scintillation 
counters for tritium analysis), the instruments that were not used for the independent test shall be verified 
at regular intervals at least every 12 months against the measurement instrument that was used for the test. 
The laboratory shall show that all other measurement instruments also meet the accuracy and precision

requirements. It shall consider factors such as chemical recovery, quenching, concentration range, sample 
preparation methods and so on, where applicable.  
The dosimetry service shall have the independent tests performed by the relevant reference calibration 
centre (see appendix J), or by another recognized national or international laboratory, in consultation with 
the CNSC, unless otherwise stated in the dosimetry service licence. If the relevant reference calibration 
centre does not offer the test, the dosimetry service shall seek CNSC approval to use a different 
organization to perform the independent tests. 
Dosimetry services shall also have their analytical performance tested at levels of activity encountered in 
routine personnel monitoring as well as at expected levels following accidental exposures. Test samples 
will be spiked with a known quantity of a traceable activity greater than or equal to the MTL. 
Measurement reproducibility will be tested by providing several identical samples of each level of 
activity. 
The dosimetry service shall comply with the specifications described in appendix F, Independent Test 
Specifications for Internal Dosimetry. 
4.5 
In vivo accuracy and precision specifications 
The mean relative bias, B, shall be calculated from measurements, Ai, of each level of activity, A, included 
in the test. 
The precision of the bias, PB, is a measure of the reproducibility of the results in a series of in vivo 
measurements made on all phantoms. It is calculated using the following equation: 
𝑃
𝐵= √∑
(𝐵𝑖−𝐵)2
𝑛
𝑖=1
𝑛−1
 
where 
Bi 
= 
relative bias of a single measurement 
B 
= 
mean relative bias 
n 
= 
number of measurements made on all phantoms 
Since bias is often greater at lower levels of activity near the limits of detection than at higher levels of 
activity, dosimetry service laboratories shall be tested at several levels of activity no lower than the MTL. 
The in vivo accuracy and precision specifications for independent and performance tests are such that the 
root mean squared error (RMSE) of B and PB, as expressed in the following formula, must be less than or 
equal to 0.25, as follows: 
𝑅𝑀𝑆𝐸= √𝐵2 + 𝑃
𝐵
2 ≤0.25 
The RMSE applies to all of the measurements that are part of a single in vivo independent test (e.g., the 
mean relative bias and precision of the bias from all phantoms included in the test).

Independent testing for in vivo measurements 
Internal dosimetry services shall undergo and pass independent testing prior to licensing. Upon receipt of 
a licence, the dosimetry service shall undergo independent testing at regular intervals at least every 
12 months, or at other intervals determined in consultation with the CNSC so that continuing competence 
can be demonstrated even if no changes are made to the measurement system. Such factors as variation of 
source distribution within the phantom, variations in ambient background, and positioning error shall be 
taken into account where applicable. 
The dosimetry service shall have the independent tests performed by the relevant reference calibration 
centre (see appendix J), or by another recognized national or international laboratory, in consultation with 
the CNSC, unless otherwise stated in the dosimetry service licence. If the relevant reference calibration 
centre does not offer the test, the dosimetry service shall seek CNSC approval to use a different 
organization to perform the independent tests. 
If the dosimetry service makes alterations to the detectors, counting geometry, or the electronics of the 
measurement system that may affect the calibration, a further independent test is required. Phantoms used 
for calibration at photon energies below 100 kiloelectron volts (keV) shall be constructed of tissue-
equivalent material and shall be anthropomorphic. For photon energies above 100 keV, acceptable 
phantoms can be made from other materials [6]. 
The dosimetry service shall comply with the specifications described in appendix F. 
4.7 
Interpretation of bioassay data 
4.7.1 
Ascertaining the committed effective dose 
Internal dosimetry services shall ascertain and record the committed effective dose to workers from the 
types of measurements referred to in the licence, taking into consideration appropriate human 
physiological parameters and other relevant information on the conditions of exposure. The method used 
to ascertain the dose shall be submitted to the CNSC for approval. Guidance on the calculation of internal 
doses is provided in GD-150, Designing and Implementing a Bioassay Program, and G-147, 
Radiobioassay Protocols for Responding to Abnormal Intakes of Radionuclides. The technical content of 
these two documents has been incorporated in draft REGDOC-2.7.2, Dosimetry, Volume 1: Ascertaining 
Occupational Dose, which the CNSC expects to finalize and publish in early 2020. New guidance has 
also been developed. See the CNSC’s regulatory documents Web page for more details. 
When ascertaining the committed effective dose to workers, dosimetry services shall consider site-
specific parameters, unless other values (e.g., default values) have been previously approved by the 
CNSC. All key parameters shall be documented.

Technical Requirements – Dosimetry Services for Radon Progeny and Radon Gas 
Exposures to radon progeny and radon gas are estimated from grab-sampling measurements combined 
with occupancy time records or from personal monitoring.

A dosimetry service for radon progeny and radon gas shall comply with the following requirements: 
1. Determine the lowest exposure or concentration in air that the dosimetry service can measure at the 
95% confidence level with the overall accuracies specified, as described in section 5.2, Minimum 
measurable exposure or concentration. 
2. Measure the quantity of interest within the accuracy specifications and uncertainty limits that apply to 
that quantity, as described in section 5.3, Accuracy specifications for radon progeny measurements, 
and section 5.6, Accuracy specifications for radon gas measurements.  
3. Demonstrate its ability to satisfy overall specifications through type testing, as described in 
section 5.4, Type testing for radon progeny measuring instruments, and section 5.7, Type testing for 
radon gas monitoring. 
4. Demonstrate that it operates in a reliable way through independent testing, as described in section 5.5, 
Independent testing for the monitoring of radon progeny, and section 5.8, Independent testing for 
radon gas measurements. 
5.1 
Measurement quantities 
The quantities to be measured include the following characteristics: 
1. the concentration in air of potential alpha energy from short-lived radon progeny  
2. the exposure to airborne short-lived radon progeny 
3. the concentration in air of radon gas 
There are historical and International System of Units (SI), or SI-compatible units of measurement for the 
concentration of short-lived radon progeny in air and exposure to radon progeny.  
The working level (WL) is the historical unit for the measurement of radon progeny concentration in air. 
The corresponding SI unit is the joule per cubic metre (J m-3), where 
 
 
1 WL = 20.8 μJ m-3  
 
and  
1 μJ m-3 = 4.8 x 10-2 WL 
The working-level month (WLM) is the historical unit used to express exposures to radon progeny. The 
SI-compatible unit is the joule-hour per cubic metre (J h m-3) where 
 
 
1 WLM = 3.54 mJ h m-3 
 
and  
1 mJ h m-3 = 0.283 WLM 
The concentration of radon gas in air is measured in activity per unit volume of that atmosphere 
(i.e., Bq m-3). The intake (Bq) from this concentration is calculated by multiplying the concentration by a 
defined breathing rate (i.e., 1.2 m3 h-1) and the occupancy time (h). Alternatively, exposure can be 
determined in Bq h m-3 and the intake would be this value multiplied by the breathing rate [7]. 
5.2 
Minimum measurable exposure or concentration 
The dosimetry service shall perform the following tasks: 
1. Determine and record the lowest exposure or concentration in air that it can measure at the 95% 
confidence level with the overall accuracies of +50% / -33%. 
2. Express the minimum measurable exposure in the same units as the measured quantity. 
Section H.1 provides examples of the statistical method used to determine the minimum measurable 
activity concentration.

Accuracy specifications for radon progeny measurements 
Two categories of instruments monitor individual exposures to radon progeny: 
1. personal monitors, which give a direct estimation of individual exposures 
2. grab-sampling instruments, which provide a measure of radon progeny concentration at a given place 
and time, and whose readings are used in combination with occupancy time records to calculate 
individual exposures 
Both categories of instruments shall meet the corresponding requirements of this section.  
5.3.1 
Personal monitors 
The test for personal monitors shall be conducted in an environment with stable and fixed concentration. 
The 95% confidence limit calculated from the test results shall fall within the confidence interval limits 
indicated in table 5. Historical units are given first, followed by SI or SI-compatible units in parentheses.

For grab sampling, the testing program highlighted in section G.3, may be used to assess compliance with 
the accuracy requirements of table 6. 
5.4 
Type testing for radon progeny measuring instruments 
The dosimetry service shall demonstrate its ability to satisfy overall specification requirements through 
type testing at the licence application stage. The type testing requirements for radon progeny measuring 
instruments are as follows: 
1. Type testing for personal monitors shall identify all possible sources of error and quantify their 
contribution to the overall error and uncertainty in individual exposures. 
August 2020 
REGDOC-2.7.2, Dosimetry, Volume II: 
 
Technical and Management System Requirements for Dosimetry Services 
 
 
15 
 
 
2. In addition to establishing a personal monitor’s overall accuracy, the type testing shall indicate the 
limitations of the device (such as conditions that may result in the onset of filter saturation problems), 
the time during which the device can be reliably used without the need to recharge the battery, and so 
on. 
3. Type testing for grab-sampling instruments shall identify and quantify all possible sources that 
contribute to the overall error and uncertainty in measured instantaneous radon progeny 
concentrations, except for errors and uncertainties in actual personal exposures derived from 
grab-sampling measurements, which are excluded.  
4. When the dosimetry service makes changes (e.g., to the instrumentation or methods used) that may 
affect the performance of personal monitors and grab-sampling instruments, the dosimetry service 
shall repeat the type tests for measurement accuracy and precision to the extent necessary to 
demonstrate that the specifications of tables 5 and 6 continue to be met. 
5. The dosimetry service shall report the results of these type tests, which have been repeated following 
changes made to the system, to the CNSC along with the records described in section 5.4.2, 
Documentation, and shall obtain CNSC approval prior to the implementation of these changes. 
5.4.1 
Influence quantities that may affect accuracy or uncertainty 
The dosimetry service shall consider the following influence quantities and evaluate those that are likely 
to significantly affect accuracy or uncertainty. Other influence quantities that may contribute to overall 
uncertainty shall also be considered (i.e., all influence quantities contributing to the uncertainty of the 
measurement) shall be taken into account. 
For sampling parameters of personal monitors, the following quantities shall be taken into account: 
1. duration of operation at design performance at full charge of the battery  
2. sampling flow rate  
3. flow rate variability 
4. influence of particle size distribution, particularly unattached fraction of radon progeny on sampling 
efficiency 
For detection and counting parameters of personal monitors, the following quantities shall be taken into 
account: 
1. filter-detector geometry  
2. energy-dependent detection efficiency  
3. sensitivity to radiation emitted from sources other than radon progeny  
4. sensitivity to deviations from detector processing specifications 
5. sensitivity to time variability of radon progeny concentrations 
For grab-sampling instruments, the following quantities shall be taken into account: 
1. sampling flow rate  
2. flow rate variability  
3. sensitivity to particle size distribution, particularly unattached fraction of radon progeny in the test 
atmosphere  
4. calibration and stability of field alpha counters 
5. the method used to calculate radon progeny concentrations

5.5 
Independent testing for the monitoring of radon progeny 
The dosimetry service shall comply with the following requirements: 
1. Undergo independent testing to demonstrate that it meets the accuracy specifications, as described in 
section 5.3, Accuracy specifications for radon progeny measurements. 
2. Perform the independent tests through the relevant reference calibration centre for the monitoring of 
radon progeny in Canada (see appendix J) or through another recognized national or international 
laboratory in consultation with the CNSC.  
3. Send a representative sample of its personal monitors to the reference calibration centre at regular 
intervals at least every 12 months, or at other intervals determined in consultation with the CNSC, 
and also following any changes in design that could affect the performance of monitors.  
4. Comply with the specifications for grab sampling described in appendix G, Independent Test 
Specifications for Radon Progeny and Radon Gas.  
5. Notify the CNSC immediately, in writing (electronic format acceptable), when it fails one of its 
independent tests.

Technical Requirements – Dosimetry Services for Intakes of Airborne Radioactive 
Material 
Airborne radioactive material refers to any suspension in air of radioactive material whose characteristics 
or concentrations are such that there is no practical means to determine dose through bioassay. Such 
materials may include, but are not limited to, U-238 and its decay products (other than radon and radon 
progeny), Th-232, and some plutonium isotopes. Airborne radioactive materials exist in various physical 
and chemical forms including dust, gas, fumes, or vapours. This section applies to measurements of 
airborne radioactive materials that do not fall within the scope of section 5 of this document. 
Monitoring for airborne radioactive material helps to estimate individual doses or exposures to those 
radiological risks for workers in uranium processing facilities, research facilities, and at other facilities 
where radioactive-material-laden atmospheres are found. Estimates are made from personal monitoring.

6.1 
Measurement quantities 
The concentrations of airborne radioactive material in air are measured in activity or mass per unit 
volume of that atmosphere (e.g., Bq m-3). The intake (e.g., Bq) from this concentration is calculated by 
multiplying the concentration by a defined breathing rate (e.g., 1.2 m3 h-1) and the occupancy time (h). 
Alternatively, exposure can be determined in Bq h m-3 and the intake would be this value multiplied by 
the breathing rate. 
The concentration of airborne radioactive material may also be expressed in units of derived air 
concentration (DAC). The DAC is the concentration of radioactive material in air breathed by a worker 
for 2000 hours that results in a committed effective dose of 20 mSv. The worker is assumed to breathe the 
air at a rate of 1.2 m3 h-1. Similarly, exposure may be expressed in terms of DAC-hours. 
6.2 
Minimum measurable exposure or concentration 
Type testing methods, criteria, and facilities, as well as independent testing facilities are currently 
unavailable for airborne radioactive material measurements. Therefore, this standard does not specify 
requirements for type testing and independent testing for airborne radioactive material measurements. 
However, a dosimetry service for airborne radioactive material measurements shall perform the following 
tasks: 
1. Measure the quantity of interest within the accuracy specifications that apply to that quantity, as 
described in section 6.3, Accuracy for airborne radioactive material measurements. 
2. Determine and record the lowest exposure or concentration in air that it can measure at the 95% 
confidence level with the overall accuracies of +50% / -33%. 
Section H.1 provides examples of the statistical method used to determine the minimum measurable 
activity concentration. The minimum measurable exposure shall be expressed in the same units as the 
measured quantity. 
6.3 
Accuracy for airborne radioactive material measurements 
The dosimetry service shall demonstrate that it follows standard good practices expected in routine 
industrial hygiene personal monitoring in the measurement of airborne radioactive material concentration 
in air. In particular, the flow rate of sampling pumps, where used, shall not deviate by more than 5% from 
the value used to calculate concentration. The airflow rate should be verified each day of air sampler use, 
or verified at a frequency interval approved by the CNSC. If the airflow rate changes by more than 5% 
during the collection of a sample, the flow rate used for dosimetry purposes should be the average of the 
initial and final airflow rates. 
Air samplers shall have a means of ascertaining the volume of air sampled. Airflow meters shall be 
calibrated at least annually, as well as after the meters have been repaired or modified, or may have been 
damaged. The calibration methods shall be based on a current method recommended by the American 
Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) or the Occupational Safety and Health 
Administration (OSHA). The method, instrument unique identifier and date of calibration shall be 
documented. 
If personal air samplers are not worn within 30 cm of the worker’s head, the licensee should demonstrate 
that the air sampled is representative of breathing-zone air [9,10].

Air sampler particle collection efficiency shall be insensitive to size, to the greatest extent possible. This 
excludes the use of cyclones to collect and measure airborne radioactive material. 
The dosimetry service shall determine the overall uncertainty in airborne radioactive material 
measurements from the combination of all the uncertainties in all the parameters used to derive the 
airborne radioactive material concentration from the activity measured on the monitor’s filter. 
Section H.2, Example calculation for uncertainty, provides examples of the statistical method used to 
estimate uncertainties in counting.

Appendix A: Accuracy and Uncertainty in External Dose Measurement 
A.1 
Introduction 
This appendix provides information and instructions on how to demonstrate that the accuracy and precision 
requirements of this regulatory document can be met. The sample calculations in section A.4 illustrate how 
various quantities are evaluated. 
A.2 
Conventionally true value 
In principle, the objective of personal dosimetry is to measure the “personal dose equivalent” Hp(d), as defined by 
International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements Report 47 [1]. The values of d are 0.07 mm for 
shallow (or skin) dose and 10 mm for deep (or whole-body) dose. In practice, the “true” value of a quantity is 
impossible to determine, as explained in the International Organization for Standardization’s Guide to the 
Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement [11]. Instead, the result of a measurement is compared with the 
“conventionally true value” of that quantity to assess errors in the measured results. 
Even if a perfect measurement of Hp(d) were possible, its definition would lead to different expected true values 
for persons of different sizes and shapes who are exposed to the same photon radiation field. This is therefore an 
unsuitable quantity to use for specification of the performance and properties of a dosimeter, and a conventionally 
true value of Hp(d) replaces the true measurement. In the case of photon radiation, for example, the 
conventionally true value is established by measuring the free-in-air collision air kerma (or exposure) in a well-
defined field with a calibrated instrument and by applying a conversion coefficient to the result. A computer 
model calculates the conversion coefficient to simulate irradiation of a standard phantom, which approximates the 
torso of a human body. The conventionally true value obtained in this way is assumed to have a negligible 
uncertainty compared with the uncertainty in routine dose measurements. It therefore serves as the reference value 
for estimating errors in the latter measurements. 
A.3 
Accuracy and precision 
The information contained in this section follows the method developed by C. R. Hirning and P. S. Yuen [12]. 
The specifications at the end of this section are based on the recommendations of ICRP Publication 60 [13] and 
Publication 75 [14], as well as on the CNSC requirement that external dosimetry services achieve levels of 
performance consistent with the use of up-to-date equipment and operating methods. 
In analyzing dosimeter response uncertainty, one should first decide on the number, N, of influence quantities to 
be considered that would affect the dosimeter response significantly, such as energy, angle of incidence, 
temperature, humidity and so on. Each influence quantity should be treated as a statistical variable, as denoted by 
the following symbol: 
Xi 
where 
 i 
= 1, 2,…,N 
For example, X2 denotes all the values that influence quantity number 2 can take on between a lower and an upper 
limit.

REGDOC-2.7.2, Dosimetry, Volume II: 
 
Technical and Management System Requirements for Dosimetry Services 
 
 
26 
 
 
After deciding on the number of influence quantities to consider, one should group the N influence quantities into 
single, first-type composite, second-type composite, or third-type composite independent influence quantities. 
This will enable the dosimeter response to become a separable function of these independent influence quantities 
and to be expressed as a product of relative responses. The conditions for separability are satisfied if, for each 
grouped independent influence quantity, the fractional change in the overall relative response at conditions other 
than the reference conditions arising from a change in the grouped influence quantity is independent of other 
grouped influence quantities [12]. 
A.3.1 
Types of influence quantities 
A single independent influence quantity, xq, consists of only one influence quantity such that the above 
condition of overall relative-response separability is satisfied. The dose linearity of a thermoluminescent 
dosimeter (TLD) is an example of a single independent influence quantity, in which the response of the TLD 
tends to increase as the absorbed dose in the dosimeter increases to a high value in the order of grays. The 
increase in the dosimeter response does not depend on the type of photon source (photon energy) that has 
delivered the absorbed dose or any other influence quantities. 
A composite influence quantity consists of a subset of the N influence quantities being considered. Similar to a 
single independent influence quantity, the fractional change in the overall relative response depends only on this 
independent composite influence quantity alone. 
A first-type composite influence quantity consists of influence quantities xi and xj and can be extended to more 
than two. The relative response as a function of xi and xj is not separable and therefore, in discrete form, consists 
of a matrix whose elements are linearly independent of one another. The occurrence probability, pij, however, can 
be separable into independent probability functions pi and pj. An example of a first-type composite influence 
quantity is given by the combination of photon energy and angle of incidence (i.e., energy-angle or E-θ). 
Energy-angle is a first-type composite influence quantity because the dosimeter relative response depends on both 
the energy and angle and is not separable. Therefore, the relative response, in discrete form, must be expressed as 
a two-dimensional matrix, rEθ, whose elements are linearly independent of one another. The occurrence 
probability function, however, is separable into two independent probability functions, pE and pθ, as energy and 
angle are not correlated. 
A second-type composite influence quantity consists of influence quantities xk and xl. The dosimeter relative 
response function is separable and therefore, in discrete form, consists of two independent vectors (as opposed to 
a matrix), each of which is dependent on only one influence quantity, xk or xl. The occurrence probability 
function, pkl, however, cannot be separated. An example of a second-type composite influence quantity is 
humidity-temperature (or H-T). The dosimeter relative response is separable into two independent relative 
response functions, rH and rT, because the fractional change of the relative response due to the change in either 
influence quantity is independent of each other. The occurrence probability function, however, is not separable 
because relative humidity depends on temperature and, in discrete form, is denoted by a matrix pHT. 
A third-type composite influence quantity consists of influence quantities xu and xv, in which neither the 
relative response, ruv, nor the occurrence probability function, puv, is separable. Thus, in discrete form, each of ruv 
and puv consists of a two-dimensional matrix whose elements are linearly independent of one another. No example 
is provided because it is rare to encounter such a composite influence quantity in external dosimetry. 
A.3.2 
Dosimeter response 
The response of a dosimeter, R, is defined as the result of a measurement under defined conditions, Hm, divided by 
the conventionally true dose that would be received under those conditions, Hc, as shown in the following 
equation:

relative responses ru and rv, or independent occurrence probabilities pu and pv 
If the effect of a change in an influence quantity on the relative response is known and the probability distribution 
of that influence quantity can be measured or estimated, the mean relative response due to that influence quantity 
can be calculated using the usual statistical techniques, as follows.

In the special case where all values of xi within the range of possible values [ximin, ximax] are equally likely, the

Probabilities may also be estimated in this way when information on the actual probabilities is unavailable. 
The variance, u2, of measured responses about the mean response can also be calculated with the usual statistical 
techniques, and its positive square root yields the standard uncertainty in the dosimeter response, u. The general 
expression for the variance in the response is as follows:

In addition to the standard uncertainty in the response, there will be a statistical relative uncertainty, us, arising 
from random errors in the measurement process. The size of this uncertainty is determined using a Type A 
evaluation [9]. The combined standard uncertainty in a single dose measurement is expressed as shown in the 
following equation: 
(13) 
𝑢𝑐= 𝑅
̅√(𝑢

Using these definitions, the overall specification for accuracy and precision is given by the following expression:

where 
ρ 
= 
1.5 for d = 10 mm and 4 mSv < Hp,c(10) < 10 Sv 
 
= 
2 for d = 10 mm and Hp,c(10) = 0.4 mSv 
 
= 
1.5 for d = 0.07 mm and 100 mSv < Hp,c(0.07) < 10 Sv 
 
= 
2 for d = 0.07 mm and Hp,c(0.07) = 10 mSv 
 
= 
3 for 100 mSv < He,c < 10 Sv 
 
= 
3 for He,c = 10 mSv. 
The combined standard uncertainty uc is multiplied by a coverage factor of 2 to give an uncertainty interval for 
individual measurements of R corresponding to a level of confidence of approximately 95%. 
Section A.4, Example calculations, provides a practical example of the calculation described above. 
A.4 
Example calculations 
This section gives an example of the calculation of mean response and combined standard uncertainty, using 
hypothetical data. For simplicity, only five influence quantities are assumed to significantly affect the response of 
the dosimeter, and only photon fields will be addressed. The five influence quantities are photon energy, photon 
angle of incidence, relative humidity, temperature and dose (dose linearity in dosimeter). The five influence 
quantities are grouped into one single (dose), one first-type composite (energy-angle) and one second-type 
composite (humidity-temperature) independent grouped influence quantities. It is assumed that the dosimeter will 
be used in the environment of a nuclear generating station.

A.4.1 
Photon energy and angle of incidence 
For the first step, measure the relative response for a range of energies and angles that represents those expected 
to be present in the station, while maintaining all other influence quantities at the reference values. The results 
from the array rij or rEθ are shown in table A.1.

Next, for each measurement point, define intervals of energy and angle, and estimate the probability of exposure 
in each interval. Tables A.2 and A.3 show the results. Although it is possible that the energy and angle of 
incidence will be correlated for a particular location and orientation, the averaging effect of moving about in the 
field will greatly reduce any correlation, and the two influence quantities can be treated as uncorrelated.

The mean relative response for photon energy-angle is given by equation 4 (see section A.3 for the equations 
referred to in this section). It may be calculated from the relative responses in table A.1 and the probability 
distributions in tables A.2 and A.3 using matrix multiplication. The equations referred to in this section are found 
in section A.3 of this appendix. By substituting E for i, θ for j, 11 for Mi, and 5 for Mj, equation 4 becomes 
expressed as shown in the following equation:

Relative humidity and temperature 
Since these two influence quantities are assumed to affect the dosimeter response independently, the relative 
responses can be measured for a series of values for each quantity while maintaining the other at its reference 
value. Again, intervals are defined about each of the measured values, so that the full range of interest is covered. 
Tables A.4 and A.5 give the measurement points, the corresponding intervals and the relative responses.

Mean response and combined uncertainty

A series of replicated measurements at doses greater than 4 millisieverts (mSv), with all of the five influence 
quantities held constant at the reference conditions, shows a statistical relative uncertainty, us, of 10 percent. This 
can be taken as the Type A assessment of uncertainty due to random errors. 
Combining the standard uncertainty in the response with the statistical relative uncertainty according to 
equation 13 leads to the combined standard uncertainty in a single measurement: 
 
𝑢𝑐= 1.044√0.0045
(1.044)2 + (0.1)2 
 
𝑢𝑐= 0.124 
The upper and lower limits defined by equation 14 are 0.80 and 1.29, which lie well within the required limits of 
0.67 and1.5, corresponding to ρ = 1.5. 
At 0.4 mSv, where the requirement is given by ρ = 2, the mean relative response and the uncertainty in the 
response are likely to be the same as at higher doses. The uncertainty arising from random errors is the component 
of the overall uncertainty that is likely to increase and must be separately determined at this lower dose.

Appendix B: Type Test Specifications for External Dosimetry 
B.1 
Introduction 
Section 2.4, Type testing, describes a requirement for type testing in addition to the in-house management system 
described in section 7, Management System Requirements. Dosimeters in routine use may be exposed to 
conditions other than those mentioned here, which may influence the result of a dose measurement. Such 
conditions shall be identified and included in the type tests, in addition to those listed below. 
Wherever possible, an error introduced by an influence quantity should be corrected by applying a correction 
factor to the calculation of Hm (the result of a measurement under defined conditions) with the objective of 
making the mean relative response for that influence quantity close to unity. The use of such an influence quantity 
must be clearly stated in the type test report. Circumstances may exist, however, in which it is impractical or 
undesirable to apply a correction for a particular influence quantity. In such cases, the error introduced by the 
influence quantity will be included in the determination of the mean response. 
B.2 
Influence quantities and system characteristics 
The dosimetry service shall consider the following influence quantities and evaluate those that are likely to 
significantly affect accuracy or uncertainty. In deciding on the potential significance of the influence quantities, 
both the design of the dosimetry system and the intended conditions of use shall be taken into account. 
Influence quantities include the following: 
1. angle of incidence of radiation  
2. distance of dosimeter from phantom  
3. dose (i.e., linearity of dose response)  
4. dose rate, including in pulsed radiation fields  
5. electrical and magnetic fields, both static and alternating  
6. energy of photons and beta rays  
7. humidity and splashing  
8. ionizing radiations other than those intended to be measured  
9. mechanical shock, both dropping and vibration of the dosimeter  
10. mixed radiation fields  
11. temperature variations, both gradual and abrupt  
12. time between zeroing and irradiation, and between irradiation and reading  
13. visible and ultraviolet light flux (effect on both dosimeter and reader) 
14. voltage supply to reader, both voltage spikes and gradual variations 
In addition, the dosimetry service shall estimate the effects of the following system characteristics, as applicable: 
1. batch homogeneity  
2. calibration uncertainty  
3. repeatability (a measure of the stability of response of both the dosimeter and the reader)  
4. residual signal  
5. self-irradiation 
6. zero-dose variations 
Where an influence quantity or system characteristic causes a large and sudden change in the measured dose, but 
has a low probability of occurring, it is inappropriate to include that change as a component of the combined

standard uncertainty. Instead, steps shall be taken to minimize the probability that the influence quantity will 
cause the effect, either by changing the dosimeter design or by instituting procedural controls, and estimating the 
reduced probability of occurrence. 
B.3 
Phantoms 
During irradiation, dosimeters shall be mounted on an appropriate phantom for type tests of the following 
influence quantities: angle of incidence of radiation, distance of dosimeter from phantom, and energy of photons 
and beta rays. For tests of other influence quantities requiring irradiation, any convenient irradiation geometry 
may be used, provided that the relative doses delivered to the dosimeters are known to the degree of accuracy 
appropriate to the test. The signal produced by the dosimeters in these tests can be related to the corresponding 
conventionally true dose using the results of the on-phantom irradiations. 
For dosimeters to be worn during torso (whole-body) irradiations, the phantom to be used for photon irradiations 
is a parallelepiped (“slab”), constructed of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) walls and filled with water [15]. The 
external dimensions are 30 cm x 30 cm x 15 cm, and the wall thicknesses are 2.5 mm for the front wall (one of the 
30 cm x 30 cm faces) and 10 mm for the other five walls. The phantom shall be constructed in a way that ensures 
that the front face remains flat when the phantom is filled with water. For beta irradiations, the phantom to be 
used may be the same water-filled slab phantom as described above. A solid PMMA slab phantom of the same 
face dimensions and a thickness greater than one half of the range of the most energetic beta particles may also be 
used. 
For extremity dosimeters, the phantoms to be used shall be radiologically suitable representations of the 
appropriate parts of the extremities where the dosimeters will be worn. These will usually be the fingers, wrists 
and ankles. The phantoms to be used shall be appropriate to both the dosimeter design and the radiological 
environment in which they will be used. Two possible phantoms for use are indicated below. Only the one that is 
most representative of the limb on which the dosimeter would be most frequently placed, shall be used in the type 
testing. The dosimetry service shall consult the CNSC prior to using other phantoms. 
1. Finger: solid PMMA cylinder with a 19-mm diameter and a length of 300 mm [16, 17, 18, 19, 20]  
2. Wrist/ankle: water-filled PMMA cylinder with an outer diameter of 73 mm, a wall thickness of 2.5 mm and a 
length of 300 mm [20]  
The references include the associated air-kerma-to-dose conversion coefficients. More recent references 
containing more up-to-date information may also be used as they become available. However, the dosimetry 
service shall consult the CNSC prior to using other references. 
B.4 
Angle of incidence of radiation 
For dosimeters that are irradiated on the slab phantom described above, the test radiations shall be incident on the 
front face of the dosimeter at angles of 0˚, 20˚, 40˚ and 60˚, relative to normal incidence. If the design of the 
dosimeter results in an angular response that is cylindrically symmetric about the axis perpendicular to its front 
face, it will be sufficient to make the measurements along only one direction in one plane (i.e., 4 measurements 
will be required). If cylindrical symmetry does not apply, the measurements may be required in both directions in 
two perpendicular planes (i.e., up to 13 measurements may be required) to adequately characterize the angular 
response of the dosimeter. In the latter case, the average response for each angle is calculated and indicated as the 
response for that angle. 
For extremity dosimeters, the test radiations shall be incident on the front face of the dosimeter at angles of 0˚, 30˚ 
and 60˚ relative to normal incidence in two perpendicular planes (i.e., a minimum of 5 measurements will be

REGDOC-2.7.2, Dosimetry, Volume II: 
 
Technical and Management System Requirements for Dosimetry Services 
 
 
39 
 
 
required). If the dosimeter is not cylindrically symmetrical, 9 measurements may be required. The average 
response for each angle is calculated and indicated as the response for that angle. 
B.5 
Photon energies 
For all types of dosimeters, the photon energies used for the test irradiations shall conform to ISO 4037-1 [21]. 
Coefficients to convert from exposure or collision air kerma to Hp,c(d) have been calculated and published for 
these energy spectra (see ISO 4037-3 [15]). The calculations are based on a slab phantom made from the ICRU 
standard tissue that is of the same dimensions as the water-filled phantom described above. The difference in 
backscatter between the ICRU tissue phantom and the water-filled phantom is small enough that it can be 
neglected. Coefficients to convert from collision air kerma to He,c on cylindrical phantoms have been calculated 
and published. There may be a need to add build-up material in front of the dosimeter for higher photon energies 
for Hp,c(0.07) and He,c to ensure charged particle equilibrium. 
B.6 
Beta energies 
The standard beta sources listed in table B.1 shall be used for type testing dosimeters intended to measure 
Hp(0.07) and He. 
Table B.1: Standard beta sources 
Isotope 
Maximum beta energy (keV) 
Sr-90/Y-90 
2,274 
Kr-85 or Tl-204

Note that for intermediate beta energies, either krypton-85 (Kr-85) or thallium-204 (Tl-204) shall be used. ISO 
6980-1:2006 [22] (or more recent revisions of this reference) provides further information about these sources, 
except for Kr-85. The source manufacturer will provide information for Kr-85. These sources are commercially 
available with traceable calibrations for irradiation at normal incidence. For extremity dosimeters irradiated at off-
normal angles of incidence, the angular dependence factors for a tissue equivalent slab phantom may be used. The 
conversion coefficients normalized to 0˚ for Hp(0.07) at other angles of incidence have been published (see the 
European Commission report [23]). 
The accurate measurement of Hp(0.07) and He for beta radiation becomes increasingly difficult as the beta energy 
decreases and the angle of incidence increases. The overall specification in section 2.2, Minimum measurable 
dose equivalent, and table 1 in section 2.3, Accuracy specifications and uncertainty limits, will therefore be 
applied as follows: 
For Sr-90/ Y-90 beta radiation: 
The responses at all angles of incidence specified in section B.4, Angle of incidence of radiation, shall be used in 
the calculation of the mean response. 
For Kr-85 or Tl-204 beta radiation: 
The response at 0˚, shall be used in the calculation of the mean response. However, the response shall be 
measured at the other angles specified in section B.4, Angle of incidence of radiation.

For Pm-147 beta radiation: 
The response shall be measured at the angles specified in section B.4, Angle of incidence of radiation. However, 
the data need not be used in the calculation of the mean response. 
The mean relative responses and standard uncertainties for photons and betas are determined separately for 
comparison with the specifications defined by equation 14 in section A.3, Accuracy and precision.

Appendix C: Independent Test Specifications for External Photon Dosimetry 
C.1 
Introduction 
Section 2.6, Independent testing, describes a requirement for independent testing in addition to the in-house 
management system described in section 7, Management System Requirements. 
Dosimetry services that are ready to undergo independent testing shall make arrangements directly with the 
relevant reference calibration centre (see appendix J) or with another recognized national or international 
laboratory, in consultation with the CNSC. Dosimetry services using dosimeters that require processing (e.g., 
thermoluminescent dosimeters) shall follow the protocol outlined in section C.2. Dosimetry services using 
dosimeters that do not require processing (e.g., electronic dosimeters) shall follow the protocol outlined in 
section C.3. Although section C.3 describes the use of air kerma units specifically, corresponding exposure units 
may also be used, if preferred by the dosimetry service, in consultation with the reference calibration centre. 
C.2 
Protocol for dosimeters that require processing 
Where necessary, a dosimetry service shall determine a factor to convert from Hp(10), as measured by the 
dosimeters on a phantom, to collision air kerma free-in-air (or exposure free-in-air) due to Co-60 gamma 
radiation. This is necessary since the irradiations performed at the reference calibration centre are free-in-air. 
Prior to licensing and subsequently at regular intervals with a frequency of at least once every 12 months, each 
dosimetry service shall send to the relevant calibration centre at least 50 identified dosimeters per processing unit 
being tested plus sufficient control dosimeters to satisfy the readout process. For each unit being tested, the 
calibration centre will divide the submitted dosimeters into at least 10 groups of at least five dosimeters per group 
and irradiate each group of dosimeters, free-in-air, in a Co-60 photon beam to a different but known collision air 
kerma between 1.0 milligray (mGy) and 50 mGy. The collision air kerma delivered to the dosimeters will not be 
revealed at this time to the dosimetry service. 
The irradiated dosimeters and controls will be returned to the dosimetry service for processing by the established 
routine procedures of the service. The results in collision air kerma units, adjusted as necessary using the factor 
determined in the first protocol above, will be reported to the reference calibration centre by the dosimetry 
service. 
The reference calibration centre will compare the reported results with its values of collision air kerma and report 
the results, including the values of both the service and the centre, to the CNSC, with a copy sent to the dosimetry 
service. In order to pass this test, the reported results shall lie within the criteria described in section 2.6, 
Independent Testing. 
C.3 
Protocol for dosimeters that do not require processing 
Where necessary, a dosimetry service using dosimeters that do not require processing shall determine a factor to 
convert from Hp(10), as measured by the dosimeters on a phantom, to collision air kerma free-in-air (or exposure 
free-in-air) due to Co-60 gamma radiation. This is necessary since the irradiations performed at the reference 
calibration centre are free-in-air. 
Prior to licensing and subsequently at regular intervals with a frequency of at least once every 12 months, each 
dosimetry service shall send at least 10 identified dosimeters to the reference calibration centre. The reference 
calibration centre will irradiate at least 10 groups of at least five dosimeters each, free-in-air, in a Co-60 photon 
beam to different but known collision air kermas of between 1.0 mGy and 50 mGy. The dosimeters in each group

of five will either be exposed to the same collision air kerma or to different collision air kermas but within a 
similar range. This will result in a total of at least 50 readings that will be recorded by the reference calibration 
centre. In view of the number of dosimeters involved in this case, any given dosimeter may be irradiated several 
times. 
The reference calibration centre will correct the dosimeter readings using the conversion factors determined in the 
first protocol above and compare the results with the reference calibration centre values of collision air kerma. 
The reference calibration centre will report the results, including the values of both the participant and the 
reference calibration centre, to the CNSC at the address below, and send a copy to the dosimetry service. The 
dosimeters will be returned to the dosimetry service upon completion of all irradiations. In order to pass this test, 
reported results shall lie within the criteria described in section 2.6, Independent testing.

Appendix D: Independent Test Specifications for Extremity Dosimetry 
D.1 
Introduction 
Section 2.6, Independent testing, describes a requirement for independent testing in addition to the in-house 
management system described in section 7, Management System Requirements. 
Dosimetry services that are ready to undergo independent testing shall make arrangements directly with the 
relevant reference calibration centre (see appendix J) or with another recognized national or international 
laboratory, in consultation with the CNSC. Dosimetry services using dosimeters that require processing (e.g., 
thermoluminescent dosimeters) shall follow the protocol outlined in section D.2. Dosimetry services using 
dosimeters that do not require processing (e.g., electronic dosimeters) shall follow the protocol outlined in 
section D.3. 
D.2 
Protocol for dosimeters that require processing 
Prior to licensing and subsequently at regular intervals with a frequency of at least once every 12 months, each 
dosimetry service shall send to the reference calibration centre at least 25 identified extremity dosimeters per 
processing unit being tested plus sufficient control dosimeters to satisfy the readout process. For each unit being 
tested, the reference calibration centre will divide the submitted dosimeters into at least five groups of at least five 
dosimeters per group and irradiate each group of dosimeters to a known absorbed dose to soft tissue of between 
10 mGy and 90 mGy at a depth of 7 mg/cm2 using its Sr-90/Y-90 source. The doses delivered to the dosimeters 
will not be revealed at this time to the dosimetry service. 
The irradiated dosimeters and controls are returned to the dosimetry service for processing by the established 
routine procedures of the service. The dosimetry service reports the results in absorbed dose units to the reference 
calibration centre. 
The reference calibration centre will compare the reported doses with those that were given to the dosimeters and 
report the results, including the values of both the service and the centre, to the CNSC (see the address in 
section D.4), with a copy sent to the dosimetry service. In order to pass this test, the reported results shall lie 
within the criteria described in section 2.6, Independent testing. 
D.3 
Protocol for dosimeters that do not require processing 
Prior to licensing and subsequently at regular intervals with a frequency of at least once every 12 months, each 
dosimetry service shall send at least 10 identified dosimeters to the reference calibration centre. The reference 
calibration centre will irradiate them to different but known absorbed doses to soft tissue of between 10 mGy and 
90 mGy at a depth of 7 mg/cm2 using its Sr-90/Y-90 source. 
The reference calibration centre will compare the results with the doses to which the dosimeters were irradiated 
and report the results, including the values of both the participant and the centre, to the CNSC at the address 
below, with a copy sent to the dosimetry service. The dosimeters will be returned to the dosimetry service upon 
completion of all irradiations. In order to pass this test, reported results within the accuracy described in 
section 2.6, Independent testing, are required.

Dosimetry services that are ready to undergo independent testing shall make arrangements directly with the 
reference calibration centre. Dosimetry services using dosimeters that require processing (e.g., solid-state nuclear 
track detectors) shall follow the protocol outlined in section E.2. Dosimetry services using dosimeters that do not 
require processing (e.g., electronic dosimeters) shall follow the protocol outlined in section E.3. 
E.2 
Protocol for personal dosimeters that require processing 
Prior to licensing and subsequently at regular intervals with a frequency of at least once every 12 months, each 
dosimetry service shall send to the reference calibration centre at least 10 identified dosimeters plus sufficient 
control dosimeters to satisfy the readout process. The reference calibration centre will divide the submitted 
dosimeters into two groups of at least five dosimeters per group and irradiate each group of dosimeters in an 
Americium-241-Beryllium (AmBe) neutron field to a different but known value of Hp(10) due to neutrons of 
between 1 mSv and 10 mSv. The delivered values will not be revealed at this time to the dosimetry service. 
The irradiated dosimeters and controls will be returned to the dosimetry service for processing by the established 
routine procedures of the service. The dosimetry service reports the results to the reference calibration centre. 
The reference calibration centre will compare the reported results with its values and report the results, including 
the values of both the service and the centre, to the CNSC at the address below, with a copy sent to the dosimetry 
service. In order to pass this test, the reported results shall be within the criteria described in section 3, Technical

Appendix F: Independent Test Specifications for Internal Dosimetry 
F.1 
Introduction 
Section 4.4, Independent testing for in vitro measurements, and section 4.6, Independent testing for in vivo 
measurements, describe requirements for independent testing in addition to the in-house management system 
described in section 7, Management System Requirements. 
Dosimetry services shall make arrangements for participating in these independent tests directly with the relevant 
reference calibration centre. 
Upon completion of the testing and analysis of the results, the reference calibration centre staff submits a report 
containing the identity of each participating dosimetry service and its corresponding test results to the CNSC. 
When the reference calibration centre staff becomes aware that a licensed internal dosimetry service has failed an 
independent test, it informs the CNSC and the dosimetry service. The reference calibration centre also submits to 
each participating laboratory a report of the test results in which the identities of the laboratories are represented 
by a code. 
F.2 
In vitro measurement independent tests 
Prior to licensing and subsequently at regular intervals at least once every 12 months, or at other intervals 
determined in consultation with the CNSC, the reference calibration centre supplies each participating laboratory 
with appropriate samples and blanks. (Dosimetry services participate for the applicable radionuclides.) The 
dosimetry service analyzes the samples according to a schedule supplied by the reference calibration centre. 
Results are entered on a standard reporting form and returned to the reference calibration centre. When all 
laboratories have responded, the reference calibration centre analyzes the results and issues a report, with each 
laboratory identified only by a code. The reference calibration centre informs each laboratory of its own code and 
informs the CNSC of the codes for all the dosimetry services (licensees and applicants). 
Further details of the independent tests and the method of analysis may be obtained from the reference calibration 
centre. Dosimetry services shall participate in these independent tests and obtain passing results prior to being 
granted a dosimetry service licence by the CNSC, and at least once per year thereafter, or at intervals determined 
in consultation with the CNSC, to demonstrate continuing capability. The procedure shall be repeated if the 
measurement method or equipment undergo any significant changes that may have an adverse impact on the 
precision, accuracy, and reliability of the measurements. 
The independent tests for in vitro bioassay will be designed so that the following precautions can or will occur: 
1. Each laboratory is provided with up to five aliquots of each spiked sample as well as a urine blank from 
which the spiked samples were prepared 
2. Colour quenching may be increased for some samples 
3. The in vitro independent test for fission/activation products may include up to three radionuclides, which may 
be varied from one year to another 
4. For a given test, all participating laboratories are sent aliquots of the same samples 
5. Instructions for sample analysis and the date of spiking are enclosed with the samples

F.3 
In vivo measurement independent tests 
The reference calibration centre has tissue equivalent phantoms available for a variety of radionuclides in the 
lung, Iodine-125 and Iodine-131 thyroid neck phantoms and water-filled bottle manakin absorption (BOMAB) 
calibration phantoms of varying size for higher photon energies. 
Prior to licensing and subsequently at regular intervals at least once every 12 months, or at other intervals 
determined in consultation with the CNSC, the dosimetry service shall undergo independent testing to 
demonstrate continuing capability. If the measurement method or equipment undergo any significant changes that 
may have an adverse impact on the precision, accuracy and reliability of the measurements after a dosimetry 
service licence has been granted and prior to implementing the new measurement method or putting the 
equipment back into service, the affected bioassay method and equipment shall pass an independent test.  
The independent tests for in vivo bioassay will be designed so that the following precautions can or will occur: 
1. The radionuclide mixtures for measurement in phantoms are limited to three radionuclides chosen from 
table 4 in section 4.1, Measurement quantities not including potassium (K)-40.  
2. The location of the activity in the phantoms is realistic (e.g., in the lungs or gastrointestinal region).  
3. The radionuclides used in in vivo testing may vary from one test to another.  
4. The water-filled BOMAB phantoms that are used for in vivo testing all contain K-40 and include 
a) reference female, 
b) 5th-percentile male, 
c) reference male, and 
d) 95th-percentile male 
Also, in order to be representative of the chest wall thickness of individuals in the workplace, overlay plates may 
be used in in vivo tests.

Appendix G: Independent Test Specifications for Radon Progeny and Radon Gas 
G.1 
Introduction 
Section 5.5, Independent testing for the monitoring of radon progeny, and section 5.8, Independent testing for 
radon gas measurements, describe requirements for independent testing in addition to the in-house management 
system described in section 7, Management System Requirements. 
Dosimetry services for radon and radon progeny that are ready to undergo independent testing shall make 
arrangements for participating in these tests directly with the relevant reference calibration centre (see 
appendix J). 
G.2 
Protocol for personal monitors 
The instruments sent shall be clean and uncontaminated, and in working order. The overall performance of a 
given system shall meet the accuracy specifications for measuring exposure to radon gas described in table 7 (in 
section 5.6.1, Personal monitors) and in table 8 (in section 5.6.2, Grab sampling). The dosimetry service shall 
contact the reference calibration centre to arrange suitable scheduling before instruments are sent. 
G.3 
Grab sampling 
Independent testing is also required for dosimetry services that use grab sampling to determine exposure of 
workers to radon progeny and radon gas. Grab sampling for radon gas may be used in situations where there are 
high concentrations of radon gas in the air but without the simultaneous presence of the corresponding levels of 
radon progeny (i.e., where the gas does not have time to decay significantly). In situations where there is time for 
the radon gas to decay, it is assumed that the air will be sampled for progeny. 
The use of grab sampling for the determination of radon progeny exposures is a staged process that requires the 
collection of aerosols on a filter over a short time period, the measurement of the radioactivity of the aerosols and 
a calculation of the potential alpha radiation (working levels (WL), or µJ/m3) due to the short-lived radon 
progeny. Calibration procedures are also required for the air-sampling train and for the counting system. The 
determination is complex and sources of error include instrumental sources and variances in the implementation 
of the collection procedure by the technicians conducting the determination. 
A conventional independent testing program to validate the performance of the measurements may be impractical 
since it would require all measurement systems and the techniques of individual technicians to be verified at the 
CNSC reference calibration facility on a routine basis. As an alternative, a designated CNSC inspector’s 
qualifications in measuring radon progeny and radon gas will be verified by the reference calibration centre on an 
annual basis. Dosimetry services may have the performance of their technicians verified on an annual basis by one 
of the following two methods: 
1. The designated CNSC inspector individually validates all technicians at each dosimetry service. 
 or 
2. The CNSC validates a designated technician representing the dosimetry service in the above-described 
method, and that technician in turn validates all other technicians on site who conduct radon progeny and 
radon gas grab sampling for dosimetry purposes. The results of the validations shall be recorded and retained 
by the dosimetry service. 
The validations described above require a minimum of 10 samples. The differences in the results of the overall 
performance of the instruments and sampling technicians shall enable the dosimetry service to meet the accuracy

specifications in table 6, section 5.3, Accuracy specifications for radon progeny measurements, and in table 8, 
section 5.6, Accuracy specifications for radon gas measurements. 
Questions with respect to direct validation of technicians at the reference calibration centre should be directed to 
the reference calibration centre.

the background count of the detector 
Tc 
= 
the count time in seconds 
E 
= 
the efficiency of the detector in counts per second per Bq 
V 
= 
the volume of the sample in m3 
An MMC of 0.05 Bq/m3 can be achieved by varying the parameters in the equation. For example, if a background 
count of 250 is used with a total count time of 3,600 seconds, a counter efficiency of 0.35, and a volume of 1.2 
m3, the MMC would be: 
 
𝑀𝑀𝐶= 2.71 + 4.65 √250
3,600
(
1
0.35 × 1.2) 
 
MMC = 0.05 Bq/m3 
which is acceptable. 
Note: The volume of the sample is dependent upon both the flow rate of the air-sampling pump and the duration 
of the sample collecting period.

Example calculation for uncertainty 
When the difference in count rate, expressed in counts per minute (cpm), is 2 or more, and the total number of 
counts (sample plus background) is more than 40, the following equations can be used to calculate the limits 
within which the true (unknown) count lies, 95 percent of the time [25, 26]. 
 
𝑙𝑜𝑤𝑒𝑟 𝑙𝑖𝑚𝑖𝑡= (𝐶𝑡−𝐶𝑏) −1.96√𝐶𝑡+ 𝐶𝑏 
 
𝑢𝑝𝑝𝑒𝑟 𝑙𝑖𝑚𝑖𝑡= (𝐶𝑡−𝐶𝑏) + 1.96√𝐶𝑡+ 𝐶𝑏 
where 
Cb 
= 
background count for the sample counting time

Ct 
= 
total count 
Ct - Cb 
= 
net count 
For example, with 
 
an ALI value of 3190 Bq and consequently a DAC of 1.33 Bq m-3 
 
2,000 hr of work/year and a breathing rate of 1.2 m3/hr 
 
a sampling rate of 2.5 L min-1 (2.5 x 10-3 m3 min-1)  
 
duration of sampling of 6 hours  
 
counting efficiency of 0.4  
 
background count rate of 1 cpm 
 
an airborne radioactive material concentration of 1/10 of the DAC (i.e., 0.133 Bq m-3) 
the activity collected on the filter is 
0.133 Bq m-3 x 2.5 x 10-3 m3 min-1 x 60 min h-1 x 6 h = 0.120 Bq 
and the total count rate (sample plus background ) is 
1 cpm + (60 s min-1 x 0.120 Bq x 0.4) = 3.87 cpm. 
If both the background and the sample are counted for 20 minutes, the background count is 20 and the sample 
count (total count) is expressed in the following equation: 
20 x 3.87 = 77 (rounded to the nearest integer) 
Solving the above equations with the above values (i.e., with Cb = 20 and Ct = 77), one obtains the following: 
 
Lower limit of the 95% confidence interval is 38 
 
Upper limit of the 95% confidence interval is 76 
Therefore, there is a 95 percent probability that the true count is larger than 38, and smaller than 76. 
Since 57 is the best estimate of the true count, there is a 95 percent probability that the airborne radioactive 
material concentration measurement lies within - (57–38)/57 and + (76–57)/57, that is within ± 33%.
