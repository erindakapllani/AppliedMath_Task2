Preface 
The Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC) is the federal organization responsible for regulating 
the use of nuclear energy and materials in Canada. It regulates to protect health, safety, security and the 
environment, and to implement Canada's international commitments on the peaceful use of nuclear 
energy. The CNSC also disseminates objective scientific, technical, and regulatory information to the 
public. 
Regulatory document REGDOC-3.5.3, Regulatory Fundamentals, outlines the CNSC’s regulatory 
philosophy and approach to applying the Nuclear Safety and Control Act. It provides information for 
licensees, applicants and the public, and contains neither guidance nor requirements. It replaces P 299, 
Regulatory Fundamentals (2005), INFO-0795, Licensing Basis - Objective and Definitions (2010), and P-
242, Considering Cost-Benefit Information (2000).  
This regulatory document is part of the CNSC’s processes and practices series of regulatory documents, 
which also covers information on licensing processes, compliance, and enforcement. The full list of 
regulatory documents is included at the end of this document, and can also be found on the CNSC’s 
website. 
REGDOC-3.5.3, Regulatory Fundamentals, Version 3 is intended for information only and does not 
contain any requirements for CNSC licensees. The information in this regulatory document will be of 
interest to anyone seeking to learn more about the CNSC and how it regulates nuclear activity in Canada. 
It also describes the CNSC’s regulatory approach on key topics such as regulatory principles, protection 
of the health and safety of persons, protection of the environment, international obligations and the graded 
approach. 
The words “shall” and “must” are used to express requirements to be satisfied by the licensee or 
licence applicant. “Should” is used to express guidance or that which is advised. “May” is used to 
express an option or that which is advised or permissible within the limits of this regulatory document. 
“Can” is used to express possibility or capability. 
Nothing contained in this document is to be construed as relieving any licensee from any other 
pertinent requirements. It is the licensee’s responsibility to identify and comply with all applicable 
regulations and licence conditions.

Regulatory Fundamentals 
1. 
Introduction 
1.1 
Purpose 
This regulatory document is intended for information only and does not contain any requirements 
for CNSC licensees. It describes the CNSC’s regulatory approach and philosophy, and outlines 
how the CNSC applies the Nuclear Safety and Control Act (NSCA) and regulations made under 
the authority of the NSCA in its regulatory oversight. The information in this regulatory 
document will be of interest to anyone seeking to learn more about the CNSC and how it 
regulates nuclear activity in Canada 
1.2 
Scope 
This document describes the CNSC’s regulatory activities. 
2. 
About the CNSC 
Regulation is a key instrument used by government to enable economic activity and to protect 
health, safety, security and the environment in Canada. The Government of Canada has 
determined that the use of nuclear substances and nuclear energy offers benefits, and that the 
associated risks must not be at an unreasonable level. These two facts drive the need for Canadian 
legislation and a regulatory body to oversee nuclear activities in Canada. 
The NSCA came into force on May 31, 2000. It established the Commission, its objects, and the 
framework under which it can effectively and independently meet those objects. The Commission 
reports to Parliament through the Minister of Natural Resources. The CNSC replaced the former 
Atomic Energy Control Board, which was founded in 1946.  
The CNSC is the sole authority in Canada to regulate the development, production and use of 
nuclear energy, and the production, possession and use of nuclear substances, prescribed 
equipment and prescribed information in order to prevent unreasonable risk. The CNSC also 
disseminates objective scientific, technical and regulatory information to the public. 
The CNSC has also been delegated authority to implement Canada’s agreement with the 
International Atomic Energy Agency on nuclear safeguards verification. For more information, 
see the Agreement Between the Government of Canada and the International Atomic Energy 
Agency for the Application of Safeguards in Connection with the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation 
of Nuclear Weapons [1] and the Protocol Additional to the Agreement between Canada and the 
International Atomic Energy Agency for the Application of Safeguards in Connection with the 
Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons[2].

2.1 
The Commission 
The Commission1 is an independent, quasi-judicial, administrative tribunal and a court of record, 
with the powers, rights, and privileges necessary to carry out its duties and enforce its orders. It 
operates at arm’s length from the government with no ties to the nuclear industry. 
The Commission has up to seven permanent members, who are appointed by the Governor in 
Council for terms of up to five years. One member is designated as President of the Commission 
and Chief Executive Officer of the CNSC.  
Subject to the approval of the Governor in Council,2 the Commission may make and amend 
regulations as it deems necessary for attaining the objects of the NSCA. The Commission is also 
empowered to grant licences to conduct nuclear activities.  
The Governor in Council may issue directives to the CNSC. Any such directive may only be of 
general application on broad policy matters with respect to the objects of the Commission, and 
not in respect of a particular case before the Commission.  
Commission decisions are science- and safety-based; they may not be overturned by the 
Government of Canada, and they are reviewable only by the Federal Court of Canada. These 
measures help ensure the independence of the Commission. To maintain its adjudicative distance 
from CNSC staff, the Commission communicates with staff only through the Commission 
Registry and through formal proceedings. This separation also serves to maintain the 
Commission’s independence. 
2.2 
CNSC staff 
The Commission employs the staff it considers necessary for the purposes of the NSCA.  
The CNSC has highly skilled scientific, technical, professional and administrative personnel who 
carry out the work necessary to fulfill the Commission’s mandate. CNSC staff perform several 
functions such as: 
• 
reviewing licence applications 
• 
conducting expert research and analysis 
• 
verifying licensee compliance with regulatory requirements 
• 
conducting activities to enforce licensee compliance, when necessary  
• 
preparing material, known as Commission member documents (CMDs), for the Commission 
and appearing before the Commission at proceedings to answer questions 
• 
carrying out a wide range of internal activities that enable the success of the CNSC’s core 
operational work 
The Commission may also enter into contracts for services to receive advice and assistance in the 
exercise or performance of any of its powers, duties or functions under the NSCA. 
 
 
1 In this document, the term “Commission” refers to the appointed members forming the Commission. 
2 In Canada, the Governor in Council is the Governor General acting on the advice of Cabinet.

3. 
The CNSC’s Regulatory Framework 
The CNSC’s regulatory framework (see figure 1) consists of the Nuclear Safety and Control Act 
(NSCA) and other laws passed by Parliament that govern the regulation of Canada's nuclear 
industry, as well as regulations, licences and documents that the CNSC uses to regulate the 
industry. 
Figure 1: Key elements of the CNSC’s regulatory framework 
 
The regulatory framework also includes guidance, which is used to inform the applicant or 
licensees on how to meet requirements, elaborate further on requirements, or provide best 
practices. While the CNSC sets requirements and provides guidance on how to meet 
requirements, an applicant or licensee may put forward a case to demonstrate that the intent of a 
requirement is addressed by other means. Such a case must be demonstrated with supportable 
March 2023 
REGDOC-3.5.3, Regulatory Fundamentals

evidence. The applicant or licensee may submit cost-benefit analysis to support its case. See 
appendix A for more information on how the CNSC considers cost-benefit analysis.  
CNSC staff consider guidance when evaluating the adequacy of any case submitted. This does 
not mean that the requirement is waived; rather, it is an indication that the regulatory framework 
provides flexibility for licensees to propose alternative means of achieving the intent of the 
requirement. The Commission is always the final authority as to whether the requirement has 
been met.  
CNSC requirements and guidance take into account international regulatory best practices and 
modern codes and standards, and align with the International Atomic Energy Agency’s Safety 
Fundamentals and Safety Requirements. The CNSC cooperates with other organizations and 
jurisdictions to foster the development and application of a consistent, effective regulatory 
framework in Canada. The CNSC welcomes feedback on its regulatory framework at any time. 
Further information on the CNSC’s regulatory framework can be found on the CNSC’s 
Regulatory framework overview Web page 
3.1 
The Nuclear Safety and Control Act 
The NSCA establishes the CNSC’s mandate to regulate the development, production, and use of 
nuclear energy and the production, possession and use of nuclear substances, prescribed 
equipment and prescribed information in Canada. 
The mandate of the CNSC is informed by the objects of the Commission, set out in section 9 of 
the NSCA, which are: 
(a) to regulate the development, production and use of nuclear energy and the production, 
possession and use of nuclear substances, prescribed equipment and prescribed 
information in order to 
(i) prevent unreasonable risk, to the environment and to the health and safety of 
persons, associated with that development, production, possession or use, 
(ii) prevent unreasonable risk to national security associated with that development, 
production, possession or use, and 
(iii) achieve conformity with measures of control and international obligations to 
which Canada has agreed; and 
(b) to disseminate objective scientific, technical and regulatory information to the public 
concerning the activities of the Commission and the effects, on the environment and on 
the health and safety of persons, of the development, production, possession and use 
referred to in paragraph (a). 
When making licensing decisions, the Commission is guided by subsection 24(4) of the NSCA, 
which states: 
(4) No licence shall be issued, renewed, amended or replaced — and no authorization to 
transfer one given — unless, in the opinion of the Commission, the applicant or, in the case 
of an application for an authorization to transfer the licence, the transferee 
(a) is qualified to carry on the activity that the licence will authorize the licensee to carry 
on; and 
(b) will, in carrying on that activity, make adequate provision for the protection of the 
environment, the health and safety of persons and the maintenance of national security 
March 2023 
REGDOC-3.5.3, Regulatory Fundamentals

and measures required to implement international obligations to which Canada has 
agreed. 
3.2 
Regulations made under the Nuclear Safety and Control Act 
The regulations made under the NSCA set requirements with respect to topic-specific 
considerations, using a combination of prescriptive and performance-based approaches. 
Prescriptive approaches tell licensees exactly what they need to do to meet requirements, whereas 
performance-based approaches set specific performance measures that licensees must meet with 
respect to particular aspects of their licensed activities. 
There are 13 regulations under the NSCA, including the General Nuclear Safety and Control 
Regulations and the Radiation Protection Regulations. Regulations under the NSCA describe the 
general application of requirements for nuclear activity in Canada, and also provide requirements 
for Class I and Class II nuclear facilities, uranium mines and mills, and the use of nuclear 
substances. The Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission By-laws and the Canadian Nuclear Safety 
Commission Rules of Procedure define the management and conduct of the Commission’s affairs.  
The CNSC regularly reviews its suite of regulations and makes amendments as needed to ensure 
that Canadians and CNSC-regulated parties continue to be supported by an effective, efficient and 
modern regulatory framework. When developing regulations, the CNSC considers various 
factors, including costs and benefits, gender-based analysis plus (GBA+), impacts on the 
environment, modern treaty implications, and regulatory cooperation. The Treasury Board of 
Canada oversees the process for the development, management and review of regulations. Its 
requirements are set out in the Cabinet Directive on Regulation (2018).  
More information about all regulations under the NSCA can be found on the List of regulations 
on the CNSC website 
3.3 
Licences and certificates 
3.3.1 
Licences 
Section 26 of the NSCA prohibits any person from conducting certain activities except in 
accordance with a licence. The NSCA gives the Commission the power to grant licences for these 
activities.  
All applicable licence conditions are reflected in the respective licence, including those that 
require the licensee to ensure that qualified personnel carry out the licensed activities, and that 
adequate provision is made for the protection of the environment, the health and safety of 
persons, and the maintenance of Canada’s domestic and international obligations. 
For more information on licensing, see section 6.1 of this document. 
The CNSC also issues certificates for people to carry out prescribed duties and for the use of 
prescribed equipment, and for the packaging and transport of nuclear substances. In each case, the 
certificate sets out applicable regulatory requirements. See section 5.4 for more information on 
certification.

REGDOC-3.5.3, Regulatory Fundamentals

3.4 
CNSC regulatory documents and domestic and international standards 
In addition to the NSCA and the regulations made under it, the CNSC has developed regulatory 
documents, which are a key part of its regulatory framework for nuclear activities in Canada. 
They provide additional clarity to licensees and applicants by explaining how to meet the 
requirements set out in the NSCA and the regulations made under it. Regulatory documents are 
organized into three key categories: regulated facilities and activities, safety and control areas, 
and other areas of regulatory engagement. 
The CNSC maintains an efficient and streamlined regulatory framework by making appropriate 
use of standards. These include, but are not limited to, standards created by independent, third-
party standard-setting organizations such as the CSA Group, the American Society of Mechanical 
Engineers, the International Commission on Radiological Protection and the Institute of Electrical 
and Electronics Engineers. Domestic or international standards may be referenced in CNSC 
regulatory documents. 
More information about the CNSC’s regulatory documents and CSA Group nuclear standards can 
be found on the CNSC’s Regulatory documents Web page. 
3.5 
Safety and control areas 
Safety and control areas (SCAs) are the technical topics that CNSC staff use to assess, review, 
verify and report on regulatory requirements and performance across all regulated facilities and 
activities. By providing a common language and architecture, SCAs improve understanding and 
communication within the CNSC, as well as between the CNSC and licensees, the Commission, 
other stakeholders, and Indigenous peoples. The CNSC’s 14 SCAs are organized in three 
functional areas: management, facility and equipment, and core control processes.  
SCAs do not constrain the CNSC in its conduct of regulatory oversight activities. Additional 
topics may be added as needed to provide satisfactory assurance of compliance. 
Appendix B provides a table that lists the SCAs and their respective specific areas. 
3.6 
Role of consultation in the regulatory framework 
Consultation with the public, licensees, Indigenous peoples and stakeholders is an integral 
component of developing the CNSC’s regulatory framework. Regulations and regulatory 
documents published by the CNSC are generally subject to a formal public consultation process. 
Meetings and workshops may be organized to engage stakeholders and Indigenous peoples, and 
solicit feedback on the development of regulatory requirements and guidance, and on what 
regulatory instruments are appropriate.  
When proposing changes to the regulatory framework, the CNSC uses a variety of means to 
actively seek input from licensees, the public, non-governmental organizations, all levels of 
government, and international stakeholders. All input gained from these activities is considered 
when the CNSC develops and maintains its regulatory instruments. The CNSC uses discussion 
papers to solicit early feedback from stakeholders and Indigenous peoples about the development 
of new or amended regulations, and when it is considering new areas of oversight or exercising 
its existing regulatory authority in a new manner. 
March 2023 
REGDOC-3.5.3, Regulatory Fundamentals

The CNSC communicates openly and transparently with stakeholders and Indigenous peoples, 
while respecting Canada’s access to information and privacy laws. It consults stakeholders and 
Indigenous peoples when establishing priorities, developing policies and planning programs and 
services. The CNSC also cooperates with other jurisdictions to increase efficiency and 
effectiveness; for example, entering into formal arrangements where appropriate. 
4. 
Public and Indigenous Engagement 
4.1 
Commission proceedings 
Commission proceedings include public hearings and public meetings. At public hearings, the 
Commission hears information pertaining to the making of licensing and certification decisions. 
Public meetings are used to brief the Commission about significant developments that affect the 
nuclear regulatory process, or to ask the Commission to make administrative decisions or deal 
with administrative issues. Hearings and meetings can also be viewed online as webcasts. 
All Commission hearings are public hearings, as they become public when a notice of hearing is 
published. The Commission may decide to allow interventions at public hearings. If interventions 
are allowed the Commission decides whether to allow written interventions only or also oral 
interventions.  The Commission may also decide to allow interventions for certain meeting items 
at public meetings. An example of such a meeting item is one of the Regulatory Oversight 
Reports, where written interventions from the public, as well as written and oral interventions 
from Indigenous peoples, were allowed.   
4.2 
Dissemination of objective scientific, technical and regulatory information 
As part of its mandate to disseminate objective scientific, technical, and regulatory information, 
the CNSC informs the public about the development, production, possession, transport and use of 
nuclear substances on an ongoing basis. This is accomplished through various means, including: 
• 
regulatory documents, decisions, reports, and plans posted to the CNSC website 
• 
public Commission hearings and meetings 
• 
live webcasts during Commission hearings and meetings 
• 
social media platforms (YouTube, Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn) and online resources 
(available on the CNSC website) that provide technical and scientific information in plain 
language 
• 
public information sessions 
• 
public consultation on, and publication of, regulations and regulatory documents 
• 
sessions across Canada, to familiarize people with the CNSC and its role, and how they can 
participate in CNSC regulatory processes 
In addition, the CNSC encourages its experts to share their knowledge, and it publishes scientific 
and technical paper abstracts, as well as journal articles authored by CNSC staff on its website. 
Staff also attend national fairs and conferences that specifically target youth, municipalities, and 
the medical community. This ongoing dialogue is important for increasing public understanding 
and trust in the CNSC’s role of protecting Canadians, their health, and the environment.

4.3 
Indigenous consultation and engagement 
The CNSC seeks opportunities to work with Indigenous peoples to understand any concerns they 
may have about the nuclear sector, and to ensure the safe and effective regulation of nuclear 
energy and materials. 
As an agent of the Crown, the CNSC is responsible for fulfilling its legal duty to consult, and 
where appropriate, accommodate Indigenous peoples when its decisions may have an adverse 
impact on potential or established Indigenous and/or treaty rights pursuant to section 35 of the 
Constitution Act, 1982.  
The CNSC’s approach to Indigenous consultation includes commitments to uphold the honour of 
the Crown through information sharing, relationship building and promoting reconciliation, as 
well as to meeting its common-law duty to consult. The CNSC supports a coordinated, whole-of-
government approach to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the consultation process. 
The CNSC cannot delegate its obligation, but can assign procedural aspects of the consultation 
process to licensees. In many cases, licensees are best positioned to collect information and 
propose any appropriate additional measures. The information collected and measures proposed 
by licensees to avoid, mitigate or offset adverse impacts is used by the CNSC in meeting its 
obligations and in its efforts toward reconciliation. 
For further information on the CNSC’s approach to Indigenous consultation and engagement, see 
REGDOC-3.2.2, Indigenous Engagement [3]. 
5. 
The CNSC’s Regulatory Approach 
As discussed earlier in this document, the CNSC regulates to prevent unreasonable risk to the 
environment, the health and safety of persons, and national security. To this end, the CNSC has 
established a licensing and compliance system to ensure that all persons who use or possess 
nuclear substances and radiation devices do so in accordance with a licence, and that regulated 
parties have safety and security provisions in place that ensure compliance with regulatory 
requirements. 
This section addresses the major elements that comprise the CNSC’s regulatory approach. 
5.1 
Regulatory principle 
The CNSC’s regulatory philosophy is based on the following: 
• 
Licensees are directly responsible for managing regulated activities in a manner that protects 
health, safety, security and the environment, and that conforms with Canada’s domestic and 
international obligations on the peaceful use of nuclear energy. 
• 
The CNSC is accountable to Parliament and to Canadians for assuring that these 
responsibilities are properly discharged.  
The CNSC therefore ensures that regulated parties are informed about requirements and provided 
with guidance on how to meet them, and then verifies that all regulatory requirements are and 
continue to be met.

5.2 
Continuous improvement 
The CNSC is committed to continuous improvement of both its internal operations and its 
regulation of the Canadian nuclear industry. The CNSC therefore requires licensees to strive to 
further reduce the risks associated with their licensed activities on an ongoing basis. It assesses 
how licensees manage risk during both normal operations and in response to potential accident 
conditions applying concepts such as the ALARA3 principle and defence in depth (see 
section 4.3). In its assessments, the CNSC considers how licensees continuously evaluate, 
manage, and further reduce uncertainties with respect to hazards and safety issues. This also 
includes assessing how licensees consider additional safety and mitigation options as techniques 
and technologies evolve. 
5.3 
Defence in depth 
CNSC requirements necessitate the implementation of defence in depth (DiD) in the design, 
construction and operation of nuclear facilities or the undertaking of nuclear activities. With DiD, 
more than one level of defence (i.e., protective measure) is in place for a given safety objective, 
so that the objective will still be achieved even if one of the protective measures fails. 
To achieve this, multiple independent levels of defence must be put into place to the extent 
practicable, taking organizational, behavioural, and engineered safety and security elements into 
account, such that no potential human or mechanical failure relies exclusively on a single level of 
defence.  
DiD applies to a wide range of facilities and activities. Appendix C illustrates how the different 
levels are defined for nuclear power plants. 
5.3.1 
Emergency preparedness 
With regard to emergency preparedness and response, the CNSC has multiple emergency-related 
roles that translate to reducing risk in the event of an emergency. The CNSC regulates licensees’ 
onsite emergency plans at nuclear facilities, ensures that applicants provide support to and have 
arrangements in place with offsite authorities (such as municipal and provincial governments), 
and is also part of the whole-of-government approach to federal nuclear emergency planning.  
In the unlikely event of a nuclear emergency, the CNSC’s role is to monitor and evaluate the 
actions of any nuclear operators involved, provide technical advice and regulatory directives 
when required, and inform the government and the public of its assessment of the situation. The 
CNSC’s emergency preparedness program ensures well-coordinated, suitable responses to 
emergencies by integrating with nuclear operators; municipal, provincial and federal government 
agencies; first responders; and international organizations. The program is regularly tested 
through exercises that involve simulated incidents in coordination with licensees and government 
agencies. 
 
 
3A principle of radiation protection that holds that exposures to radiation are kept as low as reasonably achievable 
(ALARA), social and economic factors taken into account. Section 4 of the Radiation Protection Regulations 
stipulates licensee requirements with respect to ALARA. A similar principle, best available technology and 
techniques economically achievable (BATEA), may also be applied to releases of hazardous substances.

5.4 
Graded approach 
The graded approach is a systematic method or process by which elements such as the level of 
analysis, the depth of documentation and the scope of actions necessary to comply with 
requirements are commensurate with:  
• 
the relative risks to health, safety, security, the environment and the implementation of 
international obligations to which Canada has agreed 
• 
the particular characteristics of a nuclear facility or licensed activity 
The CNSC applies the graded approach to licensing and compliance activities.  
This approach is driven primarily by assessment of the risk associated with the activities being 
regulated, and the performance history of the licensee.  
The degree of oversight is also informed by:  
• 
the complexity and potential harm posed by the licensed activity 
• 
technical assessments of submissions 
• 
relevant research  
• 
information supplied by parties to Commission proceedings  
• 
international activities that advance knowledge in nuclear and environmental safety 
• 
cooperation with other regulatory bodies 
When applying the risk-informed approach, the following principles are adhered to: 
• 
the meeting of regulatory requirements  
• 
the maintenance of sufficient safety margins  
• 
the maintenance of defence in depth 
If a licensee cannot achieve the required level of safety, it will not be permitted in any case to 
continue conducting its licensed activities. 
Further information can be found in Appendix D: Risk-Informed Regulating 
 
5.5 
Protection of the environment 
Environmental protection is a shared federal–provincial responsibility. The CNSC cooperates 
with other jurisdictions and departments and, where appropriate, enters into formal arrangements 
to protect the environment more effectively and to coordinate regulatory oversight.  
The CNSC’s environmental protection mandate includes design objectives and best practices to 
minimize or eliminate the release of nuclear or hazardous substances to the environment. 
Environmental protection measures are commensurate with the level of risk associated with the 
activity. The CNSC determines whether a licensee or applicant will make adequate provision to 
protect the environment against unreasonable risk, and verifies compliance with associated 
regulatory requirements.  
Under the Impact Assessment Act, the Minister of the Environment must refer the impact 
assessment of a designated project to a review panel if the project includes physical activities that 
March 2023 
REGDOC-3.5.3, Regulatory Fundamentals 
 
 
11 
 
are regulated under the NSCA. The Memorandum of Understanding on Integrated Impact 
Assessments under the Impact Assessment Act between the Impact Assessment Agency of Canada 
and the CNSC provides procedures and guidance and allows for a single, comprehensive 
process for integrated impact assessment. 
The Impact Assessment Act replaced its predecessor, the Canadian Environmental Assessment 
Act, 2012 (CEAA 2012), in August 2019. However, at that time there were active environmental 
assessments being performed by the CNSC under CEAA 2012. Therefore, the CNSC will 
continue to carry out those active environmental assessments under CEAA 2012 until they are 
completed. 
For further information on environmental protection, see REGDOC-2.9.1, Environmental 
Principles, Assessments and Protection Measures [4]. 
5.6 
Protection of the health and safety of persons 
The CNSC sets dose limits that are within the protective health limits and establishes regulations 
that set requirements to prevent unreasonable risk to the health and safety of persons. These limits 
are described in the Radiation Protection Regulations and are consistent with the 
recommendations of the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP). 
The Radiation Protection Regulations also require every licensee to implement a radiation 
protection program that takes into consideration the ALARA principle. 
In addition to radiological hazards, regulating to prevent unreasonable risk to the health and 
safety of persons addresses conventional health and safety hazards. 
5.7 
Protection of national security 
To prevent risk to national security, the CNSC works closely with nuclear facility operators, law 
enforcement and intelligence agencies, international organizations, and other governmental 
departments to ensure that nuclear substances and facilities are adequately protected. Nuclear 
security in Canada is aided by the Nuclear Security Regulations under the Nuclear Safety and 
Control Act. These regulations set out detailed security requirements for licensed nuclear 
facilities and other regulated activities. 
5.8 
International obligations 
The CNSC participates in international fora to provide global nuclear leadership and to benefit 
from international experience and best practices. It also participates in undertakings implemented 
by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) (for example, IAEA peer reviews), the ICRP 
and other international organizations, as well as in activities under certain treaties such as the 
Convention on Nuclear Safety [5]. 
These international activities help inform the CNSC’s decision-making processes to: 
• 
understand and compare various ways of evaluating and mitigating risks 
• 
share research and operational experience 
March 2023 
REGDOC-3.5.3, Regulatory Fundamentals 
 
 
12 
 
5.9 
Nuclear non-proliferation 
The CNSC is responsible for implementing Canada’s nuclear non-proliferation commitments and 
government policy: 
• 
to assure Canadians and the international community that Canada’s nuclear exports do not 
contribute to the development of nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices 
• 
to promote a more effective and comprehensive international nuclear non-proliferation 
regime 
The international Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [6] (NPT) is the 
cornerstone of Canada’s efforts to promote its objectives of international disarmament, non-
proliferation, and the peaceful use of nuclear energy. NPT commitments to which Canada has 
agreed include: 
• 
to not receive, manufacture, or acquire nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices  
• 
to accept IAEA safeguards on all nuclear material for peaceful use in Canada  
• 
to ensure that Canada’s nuclear material exports are subject to IAEA oversight 
The CNSC implements these commitments through the NSCA and corresponding regulations, 
including the Nuclear Non-proliferation Import and Export Control Regulations. 
5.10 
Safeguards 
The term “safeguards” refers to the measures taken by the IAEA, in accordance with the NPT, to 
verify that nuclear material is not diverted from peaceful uses to the development of nuclear 
weapons. The safeguards agreements between the Government of Canada and the IAEA give the 
IAEA the right and obligation to monitor Canada’s nuclear-related activities, and to verify 
nuclear material inventories and flows in Canada. 
Through its regulatory oversight, the CNSC ensures that all applicable licensees have safeguards 
programs in place to allow for: 
• 
monitoring and reporting on nuclear material and activities  
• 
providing IAEA safeguards inspectors with access to areas where nuclear material is stored, 
and to certain specified nuclear-related manufacturing and research activities 
• 
providing operational and design information for nuclear facilities to the IAEA 
Where required by the safeguards agreements, the CNSC compiles licensee information and 
submits it to the IAEA on behalf of the Government of Canada. The CNSC also cooperates with 
the IAEA in developing new safeguards approaches for Canadian facilities, and contributes to 
efforts to strengthen IAEA safeguards internationally. 
The CNSC’s REGDOC-2.13.1, Safeguards and Nuclear Material Accountancy [7], provides 
further information on Canadian safeguards regarding nuclear material. 
6. 
Licensing and Certification 
The Commission makes independent, objective and risk-informed decisions, taking into 
consideration all of the information provided by applicants, stakeholders, Indigenous peoples, and 
March 2023 
REGDOC-3.5.3, Regulatory Fundamentals 
 
 
13 
 
staff. CNSC staff make recommendations to the Commission based on thorough assessment of 
factual evidence. The Commission recognizes the role of professional judgment, particularly in 
areas where no objective standards exist. 
6.1 
Licensing 
The licensing process consists of submission of a licence application, an assessment of the 
application by CNSC staff, and a decision by the Commission or a designated officer.  
6.1.1 
Licensing basis 
The licensing basis sets the boundary conditions for a regulated activity, and establishes the basis 
for the CNSC’s compliance program for that regulated activity.  
All licensees are required to conduct their activities in accordance with the licensing basis, which 
is defined as a set of requirements and documents for a regulated activity comprising the 
following: 
1. The regulatory requirements set out in the applicable laws and regulations 
2. The conditions and safety and control measures described in the licence, and the documents 
directly referenced in that licence 
3. The safety and control measures described in the licence application and the documents 
needed to support that licence application 
Documents needed to support the licence application are those documents that demonstrate that 
the applicant is qualified to carry out the licensed activity, and that appropriate provisions are in 
place to protect worker and public health and safety, to protect the environment, and to maintain 
national security and measures required to implement international obligations to which Canada 
has agreed. Examples are detailed documents supporting the design, safety analyses and all 
aspects of operation to which the licensee makes reference, documents describing conduct of 
operations, and documents describing conduct of maintenance. 
6.1.2 
Licence condition handbook 
The CNSC’s licensing regime includes the licence conditions handbook (LCH), which is a 
companion piece to interpret a licence. The general purpose of the LCH is, for each licence 
condition, to clarify the regulatory requirements and other relevant parts of the licensing basis.  
The LCH, which should be read in conjunction with the licence, provides compliance verification 
criteria that the licensee must follow to comply with licence conditions, operational limits and 
information on delegation of authority and applicable versions of documents referenced in the 
licence. The LCH also provides non-mandatory recommendations and guidance on how to 
comply with licence conditions and criteria. 
6.2 
Certification 
Certification applies to persons carrying out prescribed duties and the use of prescribed 
equipment, and to the packaging and transport of nuclear substances. 
March 2023 
REGDOC-3.5.3, Regulatory Fundamentals 
 
 
14 
 
6.2.1 
Certification of persons 
Persons in specific positions identified in regulations or a licence must hold a CNSC certification. 
The purpose of personnel certification is to regulate personnel who are assigned to positions that 
have a direct impact on the safe operation of a facility, or on the health and safety of workers, the 
public or the environment.  
The CNSC’s regulatory framework defines CNSC requirements and expectations for certification 
processes, including the qualifications, training, and examinations necessary to become certified, 
and the work experience, training and testing necessary to maintain a certification.  
6.2.2 
Certification of prescribed equipment 
Certification of equipment is an attestation from the CNSC that prescribed equipment4 is safe for 
use by qualified personnel. No prescribed equipment – barring exemptions such as smoke 
detectors and other equipment with a very small amount of a nuclear substance – can be used in 
Canada unless it is a certified model or used in accordance with a CNSC licence. 
6.2.3 
Certification of transport packaging 
The CNSC issues licences and certificates for packaging and transport of nuclear substances, as 
stipulated in the Packaging and Transport of Nuclear Substances Regulations, 2015 
(PTNSR 2015). These regulations are based on the IAEA’s Regulations for the Safe Transport of 
Radioactive Material (2018 Edition) (IAEA Regulations). 
The CNSC’s REGDOC-2.14.1, Information Incorporated by Reference in Canada’s Packaging 
and Transport of Nuclear Substances Regulations, 2015,[8] helps the regulated community 
comply with the PTNSR 2015. REGDOC-2.14.1 links provisions in the regulations to relevant 
content in the IAEA Regulations, the Nuclear Safety and Control Act (NSCA), other CNSC 
regulations, and other related information. 
 
 
4 Prescribed equipment is defined as the equipment prescribed by section 20 of the General Nuclear Safety and 
Control Regulations. 
Note 1: Section 20 of the General Nuclear Safety and Control Regulations states that each of the following items is 
prescribed equipment for the purposes of the Nuclear Safety and Control Act (NSCA): 
(a) a package, special form radioactive material, low dispersible radioactive material, fissile-excepted 
radioactive material, radioactive material that has a basic radionuclide value that is not listed in the IAEA 
Regulations and an instrument or article that has an alternative activity limit for an exempt consignment, as 
those terms are defined in subsection 1(1) of the Packaging and Transport of Nuclear Substances Regulations, 
2015; 
(b) a radiation device and a sealed source, as defined in section 1 of the Nuclear Substances and Radiation 
Devices Regulations; 
(c) Class II prescribed equipment, as defined in section 1 of the Class II Nuclear Facilities and Prescribed 
Equipment Regulations; and 
(d) equipment that is capable of being used in the design, production, operation or maintenance of a nuclear 
weapon or nuclear explosive device. 
Note 2: All controlled nuclear equipment is prescribed equipment for the purposes of the NSCA, with respect to the 
import and export of that equipment. 
March 2023 
REGDOC-3.5.3, Regulatory Fundamentals 
 
 
15 
 
The CNSC regulates all aspects of the packaging and transport of nuclear substances, including 
the design, production, use, inspection, maintenance and repair of packages. In addition, the 
PTNSR 2015 require certain types of package design to be certified by the CNSC before being 
used in Canada. The PTNSR 2015 also provide for the certification of special form radioactive 
material confirming that the sealed source containing the radioactive material is designed to be 
strong enough to maintain leak tightness under the conditions of use and wear for which the 
sealed source was designed. 
6.3 
Pre-licensing and pre-certification  
Pre-licensing activities, by proponents, with the CNSC, can vary in complexity from process-
related questions to technical assessments that provide feedback to a potential applicant.  
Pre-licensing and pre-certification activities may allow potential regulatory or technical issues to 
be identified early on, and improve an applicant’s understanding of the CNSC’s regulatory 
processes and requirements.  
An example of a pre-licensing technical assessment is a CNSC review of a proposed facility 
design to identify problems and means for their resolution. Refer to REGDOC-3.5.4, Pre-
licensing Review of a Vendor’s Reactor Design for more information. 
6.4 
Application assessment by CNSC staff 
When the CNSC receives a licence application, staff evaluate it to determine if the proposed 
safety and control measures described in the application, and the documents needed to support the 
application, are adequate and meet applicable requirements.  
Documents needed to support the licence application are those documents that demonstrate that 
the applicant is qualified to carry out the licensed activity, and that appropriate provisions will be 
made to protect worker and public health and safety, to protect the environment, and to maintain 
national security and measures required to implement international obligations to which Canada 
has agreed. Examples include detailed documents supporting the design, safety analyses and all 
aspects of operation to which the applicant makes reference; documents describing conduct of 
operations; and documents describing conduct of maintenance. 
Regulatory documents and domestic and international standards may be referenced in the 
information supplied by an applicant in support of its licence application, and are used by CNSC 
staff to evaluate the application. These regulatory documents and standards become part of the 
licensing basis when referenced in the licence application or its supporting documentation, or 
when directly referenced in a licence. 
Information submitted in support of an application must demonstrate that proposed safety and 
control measures will meet or exceed CNSC expectations. All submissions are expected to be 
supported by appropriate analytical, experimental or other suitable evidence. When deciding 
whether to renew an existing licence, the Commission also considers past performance by 
verifying compliance history.  
Technical assessments are conducted to support licensing, compliance, regulatory decision 
making and development of regulatory positions. CNSC staff perform these assessments based on 
the best available science (such as technical knowledge and analytical methods), taking operating 
experience into consideration. Technical assessments determine whether submitted documents 
March 2023 
REGDOC-3.5.3, Regulatory Fundamentals 
 
 
16 
 
and supporting evidence presented to the CNSC by applicants or licensees have a sound technical 
basis, measured against the CNSC regulatory framework. These assessments address the 
completeness (coverage and adequacy), comprehensiveness (depth), and the validity of the 
rationale and technical justification provided in submissions, and are also used to verify licensee 
compliance with regulatory requirements. 
If CNSC staff conclude that an application is not complete or satisfactory, the applicant will be 
asked to submit additional information. Normally, applications do not proceed to a decision until 
staff are satisfied that the application contains all of the relevant information needed for the 
Commission or a designated officer to make a licensing decision 
6.5 
Licensing and certification decisions 
Licensing decisions include the issuance, refusal, amendment, renewal, suspension, revocation, 
replacement or transfer of a licence. Certification and decertification are determined by way of 
certification decisions. The CNSC’s independence and transparency in decision making are 
supported by fair, open, transparent and predictable regulatory processes. Commission hearings 
provide stakeholders and Indigenous peoples with the opportunity to be heard, and the 
Commission takes the input from stakeholders and Indigenous peoples into consideration in its 
decision-making.  
The Commission is the decision-making authority for all licensing matters. For decisions related 
to some activities, the Commission designates its decision-making authority to certain CNSC 
staff members called designated officers (DOs). For more risk significant facilities and activities, 
decisions are made by the Commission.  
The Commission considers evidence provided by applicants or licensees and other participants, 
and also considers the recommendations from CNSC staff in its decision making. The 
Commission or the DO then decides whether or not to issue the licence or certificate, adding 
conditions as appropriate. 
Licensing decisions involve public hearings before the Commission as required by the NSCA. 
Commission proceedings are open to the public and are webcast live on the CNSC website. 
7. 
Compliance 
Once a license is issued, CNSC staff continue oversight through a compliance program. 
Compliance is defined as conformity by regulated persons or organizations with the requirements 
of the Nuclear Safety and Control Act (NSCA), the regulations made under the NSCA, licences, 
certificates, decisions, and orders made by the CNSC.  
The licensee bears the primary responsibility for safety at all times, including compliance with 
regulatory requirements. The CNSC undertakes necessary and reasonable measures to ensure 
compliance. These measures include influencing compliance awareness, verification and 
enforcement (see sections 7.2 to 7.4 for more information on compliance verification and 
enforcement).  
The CNSC holds information sessions and communicates with licensees regularly, in order to 
increase licensees’ awareness of their responsibilities and to promote compliance. 
March 2023 
REGDOC-3.5.3, Regulatory Fundamentals 
 
 
17 
 
7.1 
Planning of compliance verification activities 
The CNSC’s compliance planning process ensures that compliance activities are carried out in a 
systematic and risk-informed manner. Annual compliance work plans outline the scope, 
scheduling, resourcing and timeframe for the activities to be undertaken for the next compliance 
cycle for a particular licence or class of licence. 
The CNSC has developed a set of compliance verification activities that are based on the ongoing 
review of previous compliance findings and operational information. Once approved by the 
CNSC, any changes proposed by the licensee during the course of the given year are evaluated 
and documented using a risk-informed approach. Progress reviews are conducted periodically to 
monitor execution of the plan. 
7.2 
Compliance verification 
The CNSC inspects and reviews operational activities and documentation to verify licensee 
compliance with requirements. The frequency, scope, type and depth of these inspections and 
reviews are risk-informed. Where there may be overlap in regulatory oversight with other 
regulatory bodies, the CNSC coordinates its verification activities to optimize efficiency and 
reduce administrative burden on licensees.  
To evaluate licensee compliance, the CNSC conducts both field verification activities and 
desktop reviews.  
Field verification activities include inspections and other surveillance and monitoring activities. 
Inspection is the process by which the CNSC inspectors gather data from the site of a licensed 
activity and analyze the data, for the purpose of confirming that workers, activities, facilities, and 
equipment are in compliance with the given licensing basis.  
CNSC inspections are led by designated inspectors and are planned, controlled, coordinated, 
consistent, transparent (open to formal scrutiny) and conducted in alignment with the SCAs. The 
objectives of inspections are defined and communicated to licensees. Licensees are also made 
aware of inspection criteria, and of the standards of performance and methodologies being used. 
Desktop reviews generally entail consideration of documents and reports, such as quarterly 
technical reports, annual compliance reports, special reports, and documentation related to design, 
safety analysis, programs and procedures. Licensees are required to provide information to the 
CNSC through baseline reporting (scheduled) and event reporting. They are also expected to 
notify the CNSC of changes to operating processes, procedures or programs, or to submit written 
requests of such changes. In all cases, the CNSC assesses this information to ensure that 
operations remain within the licensing basis. 
Where a deficiency or deviation is either self-identified by the licensee or detected by CNSC 
staff, the regulated party is expected to address or correct the situation promptly. If necessary, the 
CNSC may also take enforcement action to compel compliance with regulatory requirements. 
7.3 
Enforcement 
The purpose of enforcement is to compel licensees or regulated persons back into compliance 
where non-compliance is detected. The CNSC does not take enforcement action to punish, but 
March 2023 
REGDOC-3.5.3, Regulatory Fundamentals 
 
 
18 
 
rather to encourage compliance, to maintain continued safety, and to deter further non-
compliance. 
The CNSC uses a graded approach to enforcement. Regulated parties typically identify and self-
correct non-compliances on an ongoing basis; however, where enforcement is indicated, the 
appropriate enforcement action for the given situation is determined, taking into account such 
considerations as: 
• 
the risk significance of the non-compliance with respect to health, safety, security, the 
environment and international obligations 
• 
the circumstances that lead to the non-compliance (including acts of willfulness) 
• 
the compliance history of the regulated party 
• 
operational and legal constraints (for example, the Directive to the Canadian Nuclear Safety 
Commission Regarding the Health of Canadians) 
• 
industry-specific considerations 
Enforcement actions include informal discussion, orders, administrative monetary penalties and 
legal prosecution. Any enforcement action can be used independently or in combination with 
others, resulting in a wide range of options available to the CNSC.  
7.4 
Compliance reporting 
CNSC staff report to the Commission, the public, licensees, the Government of Canada, the 
International Atomic Energy Agency, and other interested parties on the results of compliance 
verification and enforcement activities. Compliance reports document the safety performance of 
regulated activities, and are based on the CNSC’s independent evaluation of compliance and 
licensee performance.

Appendix A: Consideration of Cost-Benefit Analysis 
When the CNSC reviews proposals from applicants and licensees, or receives feedback from stakeholders 
on regulatory matters, there may be more than one acceptable approach to address a safety objective. It is 
in this context that CNSC staff may consider reviewing information on costs or benefits. The submission 
of cost-benefit analyses by applicants, licensees, other stakeholders or Indigenous peoples is optional and 
voluntary on their part. To ensure that safety is not compromised, proposed approaches considered in 
these analyses must retain the same level of safety. This appendix provides general information on 
preparing a cost-benefit analysis for submission to the CNSC for regulatory matters. Further, it provides 
information on the consideration of cost-benefit information submitted to the Commission or a designated 
officer for licensing decisions, as well as information regarding the consideration of costs and benefits by 
the CNSC for the development of regulatory documents. The end of this appendix some example 
methodologies and resources for the performance of a cost-benefit analysis.  
The CNSC does not endorse any specific cost-benefit methodology, nor does it limit cost-benefit analysis 
to any specific SCA. Cost-benefit information submitted on regulatory matters should be verifiable, 
replicable and fit for purpose. 
A.1 
Considerations when preparing a cost-benefit analysis  
In carrying out the mandate of the NSCA and associated regulations, the Commission and/or CNSC staff 
will consider any relevant information submitted by applicants, licensees, members of the public, 
Indigenous peoples and other stakeholders with respect to regulatory or licensing processes. This includes 
cost-benefit information related to an alternate proposal to meet regulatory requirements. Cost-benefit 
information may be either quantitative or qualitative in nature. Stakeholders and Indigenous peoples 
should consider the following when preparing cost-benefit information: 
A.1.1 
Level of analysis  
The level of analysis should be commensurate with the nature of the decision that needs to be made. In 
general, minor routine decisions with minor potential consequences should not demand the same level of 
analysis as exceptional decisions having major potential consequences. If investing in more data, research 
or analysis is not expected to change the ranking of alternatives, further investment is not justified.  
A.1.2 
Rationale  
The rationale should clearly set out the problem or opportunity that is being addressed and the desired 
outcome. A clear rationale statement provides a good foundation for identifying reasonable alternative 
courses of action and for determining whether each alternative is capable of satisfying the purpose of a 
proposed action or project. 
A.1.3 
Boundaries  
Boundaries for the evaluation (such as time period and geographical area) should be described precisely 
and a compelling rationale provided to explain why they were selected. A key measure of the 
reasonableness of decisions on boundaries is evidence that expanding or contracting the boundaries of an 
evaluation would not likely change the ordering of the alternatives. 
March 2023 
REGDOC-3.5.3, Regulatory Fundamentals 
 
 
20 
 
A.1.4 
Potential factors for consideration in the cost-benefit analysis 
Depending on the nature of the decision being taken, in addition to an analysis focused on the proponent, 
it may be appropriate to consider other factors during the analysis, such as human health and the 
environment. In all cases, information provided should be relevant to the CNSC’s regulatory 
responsibilities. 
A.1.5 
Consideration of alternatives 
An essential requirement for good decision making is a full consideration of all reasonable options. 
Including a comprehensive range of reasonable alternatives is also essential to demonstrating that an 
analysis is unbiased. The following should be considered: 
• 
Have possible alternatives for addressing the problem or opportunity been identified and 
listed? 
• 
Have reasonable alternatives been analyzed? 
• 
Has each alternative been developed to a reasonable level of detail for a sufficiently accurate 
evaluation of costs and benefits to reliably distinguish among the alternatives? 
• 
Has each alternative been designed using an unbiased and consistent approach? 
• 
Has the analysis of each alternative been comprehensive and based on a common set of data, 
relationships and assumptions? 
• 
Should the status quo (i.e., do nothing) alternative be considered? This option may not be 
applicable in cases where the CNSC has established an objective that must be met.  
A.1.6 
Forecasting 
Forecasting involves the prediction or estimation of the future costs and/or benefits for the selected course 
of action. Forecasting the expected impact of an alternative course of action may involve many disciplines 
(e.g., engineering, environmental sciences) and many different types of data (e.g., biophysical, 
engineering, social). Any assumptions regarding the selection of conditions for the future forecasts should 
be clear, well-explained and based on realistic evidence. 
A.1.7 
Valuation 
Valuation involves estimating the relative importance of a risk, cost or benefit; in economics, market 
prices and imputed market prices are often used for valuation. In multi-criteria decision analysis, 
valuation is undertaken through participatory processes. Extensive literature dealing with appropriate 
valuation and accounting methods exists. Cost-benefit information should explain and rationalize the 
valuation method(s) that have been used for risks, costs or benefits. 
A.1.8 
Value-based weighting 
Valuation or assigning a score to an alternative for a given criterion can be modified by a weighting 
factor, typically based on value judgments. Providing these value-judgment weightings increases the 
transparency of the stakeholder’s or Indigenous peoples’ decision making toward its preferred alternative.  
A.1.9 
Uncertainty 
Uncertainty can result in the actual outcome being above or below the expected outcome. The cost-benefit 
analysis should include a systematic and comprehensive uncertainty analysis.

A.1.10 
Sensitivity analysis 
An analysis may be based on many individual data points, relationships and assumptions; however, a 
small subset of these may have a disproportionate influence on the overall evaluation of alternatives. 
Knowing which data, relationships and assumptions have the greatest influence on the overall result is 
important from a decision-making perspective. 
Sensitivity analysis is valuable in deciding whether more investment in data collection and research is 
warranted before a decision on a project is made. Cost-benefit information should include a sensitivity 
analysis that ranks key data points, relationships and assumptions relative to their impact on the results of 
the evaluation of alternatives. Of particular importance is to identify those data points, relationships and 
assumptions that are likely to alter the final ranking of the alternatives. 
Sensitivity analysis, however, can be essentially open-ended with larger projects involving many data 
points, relationships and assumptions. Prudence and judgment are required to balance demands for more 
sensitivity analysis with the likelihood of new insights being provided. The cost-benefit analysis should 
provide a compelling rationale for the limits to the sensitivity analysis conducted. 
A.1.11 
Replicability 
An analysis is considered replicable if a qualified third party would be able to duplicate the evaluation of 
alternatives and reach the same conclusion using the same data and methods. Thorough, clear and 
accessible documentation that includes all data, sources, forecasting methods, assumptions and 
calculations are critical for replicability.  
A.1.12 
Discount rate 
Discounting allows for the calculation of costs and benefits that occur over several years, taking inflation 
and other factors into account. Choosing an appropriate discount rate is an important consideration 
because it will affect the calculation of net costs and benefits and potentially have an impact on the 
conclusion. In all cases, the discount rate used in the analysis should be clear. 
A.2 
Considerations of costs and benefits for licence applications and decisions 
The Commission makes independent and transparent decisions on the licensing of nuclear-related 
activities in Canada. When making a decision under the NSCA, the Commission or its designated officer 
will consider any relevant information submitted by licensees, applicants, Indigenous peoples or other 
stakeholders. This includes cost-benefit information related to an alternate, acceptable proposal to address 
a safety objective and/or meet regulatory requirements. It is in this context that CNSC staff may consider 
reviewing information on costs or benefits. However, CNSC staff will not perform any cost-benefit 
analyses with respect to licensing matters, as the CNSC does not have any economic mandate under the 
NSCA. The submission of cost-benefit analyses by licensees, applicants, Indigenous peoples or other 
stakeholders in support of a licensing process is optional and voluntary on their part, and the proposed 
approaches considered in those analyses must retain the same level of safety in all cases. The 
consideration of the cost-benefit information is not limited to any specific SCA or other matter of 
regulatory interest during the licensing process. 
A.3 
Considerations of costs and benefits in regulatory documents 
CNSC staff develop regulatory documents (REGDOCs) to help clarify the CNSC’s expectations for 
compliance with acts, regulations and licence conditions.

Request for Information statements are posted with draft regulatory documents issued for public 
consultation. Request for Information statements outline additional background information, the 
document’s objectives, and the proposed regulatory approach. Stakeholders and Indigenous peoples are 
also invited to identify any potential impacts (including financial impacts) and/or any proposed alternative 
approaches that meet the safety objectives set out in the proposed document. 
The CNSC considers all comments received from stakeholders and Indigenous peoples, including any 
cost-benefit information submitted, as it finalizes its regulatory approach.  
When establishing the deadline for the submission of comments on regulatory documents, CNSC staff 
will consider the time that may be required for the preparation of submissions on the costs and benefits 
related to the draft regulatory document. 
A.4 
Examples and resources for developing a cost-benefit analysis 
The following resources are available to help in the development of a cost-benefit analysis: 
1. The CNSC must meet the requirements set out in the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat’s Policy

Appendix C: Levels of Defence in Depth for Nuclear Power Plants 
Defence in depth is a principle implemented primarily through a combination of multiple consecutive and 
independent levels of protection. For nuclear power plants, defence in depth consists of different levels of 
equipment and procedures to maintain the effectiveness of physical barriers placed between radioactive 
materials and workers, the public or the environment. Table A shows an example of the objectives and 
implementation of each level in a defence-in-depth regime for a nuclear power plant.

Appendix D: Risk-Informed Regulating 
Introduction 
To regulate an evolving nuclear sector, the CNSC maintains an effective and agile Regulatory 
Framework. The CNSC considers risk using the best available data and science in all regulatory activity 
undertaken by the organization. This approach considers the level of risk to health, safety, security and 
the environment as the basis by which to establish regulatory requirements, assess licence applications 
and ensure compliance with requirements for the conduct of a licensed activity. 
D.1 
Risk-Informed Approach 
Consideration of risk informs all regulatory activity undertaken by the CNSC. Risk is factored into the 
CNSC’s regulatory framework as well as its licensing, compliance and enforcement activities.  
Examples of how the CNSC regulates in a risk-informed manner are: 
• 
applying risk information to the development of requirements across all regulated activities  
• 
ensuring risk-informed requirements are reflected in the planning, scoping and prioritization 
of oversight activities 
• 
using national and international standards to analyse and inform the assessment of risk for a 
specific activity or facility 
• 
applying requirements and guidance in a graded manner commensurate with the level of risk 
of the regulated activity 
• 
having a regulatory framework that allows applicants and licensees to propose alternative 
methods to meet regulatory requirements where appropriate 
In reviewing licence applications, the CNSC considers the licensees’ processes and operational plans to 
undertake activities in accordance with a specified risk. In defining the licensing basis, the Commission 
also considers risk when setting licence terms, conditions and requirements. Further to this, risk 
considerations are taken into account where stricter enforcement action is applied for non-compliance 
against higher-risk activities. Activities with the highest risk profile receive the highest level of regulatory 
oversight. While taking a risk-informed approach, applicants and licensees must maintain sufficient levels 
of safety and security under all conditions by complying with regulatory requirements. Two important 
aspects of risk-informed regulation are the application of a graded approach and flexibility to consider 
alternative approaches to meeting requirements. 
D.1.1 Graded approach 
The IAEA Safety Glossary defines Graded Approach as follows: “For a system of control, such as a 
regulatory system or a safety system, a process or method in which the stringency of the control measures 
and conditions to be applied is commensurate, to the extent practicable, with the likelihood and possible 
consequences of, and the level of risk associated with, a loss of control.”  
The IAEA definition further states: “The use of a graded approach is intended to ensure that the necessary 
levels of analysis, documentation and actions are commensurate with, for example, the magnitudes of any 
radiological hazards and non-radiological hazards, the nature and the particular characteristics of a 
facility, and the stage in the lifetime of a facility.” 
March 2023 
REGDOC-3.5.3, Regulatory Fundamentals 
 
 
29 
 
The CNSC in turn defines Graded Approach as “a method or process by which elements such as the level 
of analysis, the depth of documentation and the scope of actions necessary to comply with requirements 
are commensurate with: 
• 
the relative risks to health, safety, security, the environment and the implementation of 
international obligations to which Canada has agreed 
• 
the particular characteristics of a nuclear facility or licensed activity” 
Using a graded approach, the CNSC conducts an assessment of a safety case for a proposed activity to 
ensure regulatory requirements and safety objectives are met. 
The graded approach is the application of regulatory requirements in a risk-informed manner and may 
consider some of the following, depending on the activity: 
• 
safety characteristics 
• 
fuel design and source term 
• 
amount and enrichment of fissile and fissionable material 
• 
presence of high-energy sources, and other radioactive and hazardous sources 
• 
uncertainties associated with the regulated activity 
• 
site characteristics (e.g., external hazards) 
Activities with greater risk require stronger risk mitigation measures. For example, where there is greater 
uncertainty on facility operation, more stringent measures for containment, control and cooling, additional 
instrumentation, increased inspection frequency or a more restrictive operating envelope may be needed. 
Conversely, where there is less risk, less stringent mitigation measures may be adequate to achieve 
desired outcomes of fulfilling fundamental safety functions. For example, the inherent risk levels between 
a small research reactor such as SLOWPOKE-2 (20 MW thermal) and a large reactor designed for 
electricity generation (800 MW thermal), are significantly different. The use of the graded approach to 
regulating results in the application of measures that are proportionate to the risk of the facility. 
D.1.2 Alternative approach 
An applicant/licensee can propose alternative approaches to meet regulatory requirements. The 
applicant/licensee must demonstrate that the proposed alternative meets the overarching safety 
requirement.   
Examples of alternative approaches include: 
• 
application of national or industry codes and standards from other jurisdictions 
• 
use of an approach or application proven in another industry but not yet commonly applied to 
the nuclear sector 
• 
introduction of innovative or new technologies 
One example of an alternative approach is the systems used for cooling reactors during emergencies. 
Water-based emergency cooling systems are used in water-cooled reactors to remove heat generated 
during reactor accidents and malfunctions. New novel reactor designs and innovative technologies are 
being developed that use other mechanisms, such as passive air cooling, to remove heat under accident 
and malfunction conditions. Applicants/licensees must demonstrate that, when using this novel approach, 
heat removal is sufficient to cool the fuel and maintain fuel integrity to the level set in regulatory 
requirements.

D.2 
What the Risk-Informed Approach Means to an Applicant or Licensee 
Employing the flexibility to consider alternative approaches to comply with regulatory requirements 
enables applicants/licensees to assess a range of approaches and to propose the approach that is most 
appropriate to their specific activity. They must demonstrate, with supporting evidence, that their proposal 
meets the underlying principle of the safety requirement and that any proposed alternative is within their 
licensing basis, as applicable. If the alternative approach is not within the existing licensing basis, a 
licence amendment may be required.  
Taking a graded approach, applicants/licensees may propose implementing the risk mitigation measures 
in a manner that is more or less stringent, depending on the level of risk of the activity. The degree of the 
CNSC’s regulatory oversight will be commensurate with the risk posed by the licensed facility/activity. 
A licensee/applicant may leverage the practices of regulators in other countries, such as accepted 
technologies, codes and standards. In such cases, the applicant or licensee needs to document the basis for 
acceptance by another regulator and demonstrate that it meets Canadian regulatory requirements.  
All evidence should be documented, traceable and quality assured. Many techniques and methodologies 
are available to support the risk-informed analysis. These techniques inform safety assessments and 
enable a more fulsome definition of risk.  
A number of standards are available to inform risk assessment methodologies, such as:  
• 
IEC/ISO 31010, Risk Management – Risk Assessment Techniques 
• 
CSA N290.19:18, Risk Informed Decision Making for Nuclear Power Plants 
• 
IAEA, INSAG-25, A Framework for an Integrated Risk Informed Decision Making Process 
D.3 
Prescriptive and Performance-based Approaches to Regulating 
The CNSC’s regulatory regime employs both prescriptive and performance-based regulatory approaches 
in setting requirements. The CNSC’s approach is effectively a continuum of regulatory requirements from 
prescriptive to performance, or outcome-based. Depending on the facility and activity being regulated, 
both approaches have a place in achieving the CNSC’s desired outcome to ensure health, safety, security 
and environmental protection.  
D.3.1 The Prescriptive Approach to Regulating 
In a prescriptive regulatory approach, the regulator establishes specific requirements for how to meet the 
desired outcomes. Detailed, technical, or issue-specific requirements are set out that the applicant/ 
licensee must meet.  
In prescriptive regulatory approaches, the determination of risk is undertaken by the regulator when 
establishing the prescribed requirements. There is no, or limited, opportunity for a regulated community 
to propose a graded or alternative approach to meeting the regulatory requirements. If the regulator 
wishes to allow other approaches to meeting its regulatory objectives, the regulatory requirements need to 
be amended to specifically allow the alternative approach. The amendments would clearly set out the 
alternative requirements to meet the regulator’s objectives. The applicant could also opt to ask the 
Commission for an exemption from the particular provision with which their approach does not comply.  
A prescriptive approach can be better suited to a mature regulated community that is not likely to see 
significant change, when scientific research indicates the need for prescriptive limits (radiation, hazardous

REGDOC-3.5.3, Regulatory Fundamentals 
 
 
31 
 
substances, etc.), or for smaller businesses/organizations who prefer the simplicity and clarity of the 
prescriptive approach from the regulator. 
D.3.2 The Performance-based Approach 
Section 5.1.2 of Canada’s Cabinet Directive on Regulation states: “Departments and agencies should seek 
to design outcome, or performance-based regulations, when appropriate.” The Treasury Board of 
Canada’s Policy on Regulatory Development also directs regulators to seek to design performance-based 
regulations where appropriate. 
Under a performance-based regulatory approach, the regulator’s desired outcomes are the same as they 
would be under a prescriptive approach: ensuring health, safety, security and environmental protection. 
The difference is that the regulator sets out objectives that must be met in order to achieve the regulatory 
outcomes. Specifically, how or what measures may be taken to achieve these objectives is not set out in 
the regulatory requirements. Under this approach, regulatory requirements do not need to be amended as 
frequently to reflect changing technology or new knowledge because the desired outcomes remain 
constant. 
With respect to outcome- or performance-based regulations, the Cabinet Directive on Regulation further 
states: “This type of regulation increases flexibility for regulated parties as well as departments and 
agencies and requires the regulated communities to focus on achieving specific and measurable 
outcomes.” With respect to the CNSC, the performance-based approach provides applicants and licensees 
with flexibility in the means to achieve the objectives. Risk assessment is inherent in determining how an 
activity should be undertaken or a facility should be designed and operated. This is where both the graded 
approach and the alternative approach are particularly important. 
The performance-based approach is best suited to technically complex situations where the safe 
implementation of new technologies and approaches may result in more effective or efficient means to 
ensure safety. In addition, this approach enables evolution and adoption of novel approaches to achieving 
regulatory compliance. This approach lends itself to consideration of continual safety-related innovations 
by the licensee. 
D.4 
Conclusion 
The CNSC’s Regulatory Framework establishes requirements using a mix of regulatory approaches. The 
CNSC continuously reviews the Framework to ensure that it is modern, agile and fit for purpose. It is 
imperative that requirements are set to achieve the CNSC’s regulatory outcomes of health, safety, security 
and environmental protection. However, these requirements must not present barriers to innovation. As 
such, the CNSC is working to ensure that its Regulatory Framework is technology neutral as much as is 
practicable.
