Radiation Protection 
1. 
Introduction 
REGDOC-2.7.1, Radiation Protection, aligns with the Radiation Protection Regulations (RPR, 
the Regulations).  
REGDOC-2.7.1, along with Volumes I and II of REGDOC-2.7.2, Dosimetry [1, 2], supersedes 
the following previously published regulatory documents on topics related to radiation protection: 
 
G-121, Radiation Safety in Educational, Medical and Research Institutions 
 
G-129, Revision 1, Keeping Radiation Exposures and Doses “As Low as Reasonably 
Achievable (ALARA)” 
 
G-91, Ascertaining and Recording Radiation Doses to Individuals 
 
GD-150, Designing and Implementing a Bioassay Program 
 
G-228, Developing and Using Action Levels 
 
G-313, Radiation Safety Training Programs for Workers Involved in Licensed Activities with 
Nuclear Substances and Radiation Devices, and With Class II Nuclear Facilities and 
Prescribed Equipment 
This regulatory document provides new guidance on the following topics: 
 
Radiation protection programs 
 
Principles of worker dose control 
 
Principles of radiological hazard control 
1.1 
Purpose 
This regulatory document provides guidance and clarity on requirements for the application of the 
RPR. This regulatory document will help ensure that licensees implement adequate measures for 
radiation protection in accordance with the Nuclear Safety and Control Act (NSCA, the Act) and 
the RPR. This regulatory document is intended for use by CNSC licensees and applicants. 
1.2 
Scope 
This regulatory document provides guidance and clarity on requirements for the application and 
implementation of the RPR to ensure the protection of workers and members of the public. The 
scope of this regulatory document does not include guidance related to environmental protection, 
which is provided in REGDOC-2.9.1, Environmental Principles, Assessments and Protection 
Measures [3]. 
Guidance on ascertaining and recording doses is included in this regulatory document. However, 
REGDOC-2.7.2, Dosimetry, Volumes I and II [1, 2], should be referred to for more information. 
Volume I contains more information on ascertaining occupational exposures and Volume II has 
more details on technical and quality management system requirements for dosimetry services.

2. 
Interpretation and Application of the Radiation Protection Regulations 
Section 1 of the RPR provides interpretations relevant to the requirements set out in the 
Regulations:  
 
Subsection 1(1) and 1(2) of the RPR provides the definitions that apply to the Regulations.  
 
Subsection 1(3) specifies the dose limit for the general public as 1 mSv per calendar year. 
Section 2 of the Regulations states the applicability of the RPR. Subsection 2(1) stipulates that the 
RPR apply generally to all licensees for the purposes of the NSCA. 
Subsection 2(2) stipulates that the RPR do not apply to a licensee in respect of a dose of radiation 
received by or committed to a person: 
 
in the course of a person’s examination, diagnosis or treatment, as directed by a medical 
practitioner who is qualified to examine, diagnose or treat the person under the applicable 
provincial legislation 
 
Note: Medical exposures are confined to exposures incurred by individuals as part of an 
examination, medical diagnosis or treatment.  
 
as a result of a person’s voluntary participation in a biomedical research study supervised by 
a medical practitioner who is qualified to provide such supervision under the applicable 
provincial legislation 
 
Note: The CNSC issues licences for human research studies. Licence applicants must meet 
requirements specified in REGDOC-1.6.1, Licence Application Guide: Nuclear Substances 
and Radiation Devices [4]. Among the requirements to obtain a licence, the application must 
include the proposed radiation dose constraints for each study. In addition, the applicant must 
demonstrate that they have a policy and procedures for obtaining and ensuring the informed 
consent of the human studies volunteers. 
 
 
while a person is acting as caregiver 
 
Note: A caregiver is a person who willingly and voluntarily – and not as an occupation – 
helps in the support and comfort of a patient who has been administered a nuclear substance 
for therapeutic purposes. A caregiver can include a family member of a patient, other than 
young children and infants, directly involved in the care of the patient. 
Although the requirements of the RPR do not apply to licensees in respect of a dose received 
by a caregiver, the CNSC recommends that doses to caregivers be kept as low as reasonably 
achievable (ALARA), social and economic factors being taken into account. The 
International Commission on Radiological Protection’s (ICRP) Publication 103, The 2007 
Recommendations of the International Commission on Radiological Protection [5], 
recommends that doses to caregivers of patients treated with radionuclides be kept ALARA 
and below 5 mSv per episode (i.e., for the duration of a given release after therapy).

3. 
Administration of Nuclear Substance for Medical Purposes 
Section 3 of the RPR specifies the obligations of licensees when a nuclear substance is 
administered to a person for therapeutic purposes. Licensees are required to inform the person of 
methods to reduce radiation exposure to others that can occur as a result of their treatment, 
including anyone providing that person with care and assistance. 
For information on providing instructions to patients, see REGDOC-1.6.1, Licence Application 
Guide: Nuclear Substances and Radiation Devices [4], and REGDOC-1.4.1, Licence Application 
Guide: Class II Nuclear Facilities and Prescribed Equipment [6]. 
4. 
Radiation Protection Program 
Section 4 of the RPR requires every licensee to implement a radiation protection program that 
meets the regulatory requirements and ensures that doses to persons are ALARA, taking into 
account social and economic factors. Licensees must observe this requirement by implementing 
the following: management control over work practices, personnel qualification and training, 
control of occupational and public exposure to radiation, and planning for unusual situations. 
As part of the radiation protection program, licensees must also ascertain the quantity and 
concentration of any nuclear substance released to the environment as a result of the licensed 
activity, by direct measurement as a result of monitoring. If the time and resources required for 
direct measurement as a result of monitoring outweigh the usefulness of ascertaining the quantity 
and concentration using that method, then quantity and concentration may be estimated. This 
requirement is also considered as part of an environmental protection program; additional 
information on these requirements is provided in section 4.6 of this regulatory document, and in 
REGDOC-2.9.1, Environmental Principles, Assessments and Protection Measures [3]. 
Program development and implementation 
An effective radiation protection program includes a policy, strategy, and method for radiation 
protection and the achievement of ALARA. Implementation of the ALARA principle must be 
integrated into all aspects of the radiation protection program, including measures to prevent or 
reduce potential exposures and to mitigate the consequences of accidents. The application of 
ALARA is discussed in further detail in subsection 4.1 of this regulatory document. 
The radiation protection program should be developed following the licensees’ management 
system principles. Licensees and applicants should consult REGDOC-2.1.1, Management 
System [7], for information on management systems that are applicable to different types of 
CNSC licensees.  
There should be a process that guides regular review of the radiation protection program and 
procedures, to ensure that the program remains current and incorporates best practices. This 
documented review should include the outcomes and follow-up, such as updating procedures, 
equipment and facilities where improvements are warranted. 
The effectiveness of the radiation protection program’s implementation should be evaluated 
against the performance objectives set for the program, at regular intervals established by the 
licensee. Performance monitoring against established objectives should be done using 
performance indicators or metrics that are easily gathered as part of the program’s outputs. 
Examples of such indicators include: 
July 2021 
REGDOC-2.7.1, Radiation Protection 
 
4 
 
 
individual and collective doses to workers and the public 
 
exceedances of radiation dose action levels 
 
surface and personnel contamination events 
 
performance of portable and fixed radiological survey instruments in terms of calibration and 
source-test failures 
Additionally, performance targets should be set to monitor the effectiveness of ALARA 
measures. More information on this topic is found in subsection 4.1.5. 
The basic structure of a radiation protection program should include the policies and procedures 
for key elements of the radiation protection framework, including: 
 
application of the ALARA principle (see subsection 4.1) 
 
management control over work practices (see subsection 4.2) 
 
personnel qualification and training (see subsection 4.3) 
 
control of occupational and public exposure to radiation (see subsection 4.4) 
 
planning for unusual situations (see subsection 4.5) 
 
ascertaining the quantity and concentration of any nuclear substance released as a result of 
the licensed activity (see subsection 4.6) 
The graded approach should be applied in the design and complexity of the radiation protection 
program, commensurate with the radiological hazards / radiological risks associated with the 
licensed activities. Additionally, specific requirements for radiation protection programs are 
found in the following CNSC licence application guides and should be consulted by applicants 
and licensees as appropriate: 
 
REGDOC-1.1.2, Licence Application Guide: Licence To Construct a Nuclear Power 
Plant [8] 
 
REGDOC-1.1.3, Licence Application Guide: Licence To Operate a Nuclear Power Plant [9] 
 
REGDOC-1.4.1, Licence Application Guide: Class II Nuclear Facilities and Prescribed 
Equipment [6] 
 
REGDOC-1.6.1, Licence Application Guide: Nuclear Substances and Radiation Devices [4] 
4.1 
Application of ALARA 
Paragraph 4(a) of the RPR requires licensees to implement measures to keep the effective dose 
and equivalent dose received by and committed to persons ALARA, taking into account social 
and economic factors. It is insufficient for a licensee to just respect the appropriate dose limits; 
efforts must be made to further minimize doses whenever it is possible and reasonable to do so. 
Management and workers must be committed to the principle of maintaining doses ALARA and 
taking appropriate measures to reduce doses where practical. 
From a practical viewpoint, the ALARA principle calls for an approach that: 
 
considers all possible actions involving the nuclear substance, radiation device and/or 
prescribed equipment, and the way workers operate with or near the nuclear substance, 
radiation device and/or prescribed equipment 
 
implies a “management by objective” process with the following sequence: planning, setting 
objectives, monitoring, measuring performance, evaluating and analyzing performance to 
define improvement initiatives and/or corrective actions, and setting new objectives 
July 2021 
REGDOC-2.7.1, Radiation Protection

 
should be adapted to take into account any significant change or evolution in the state of 
techniques and technology, the resources available, and the prevailing social context 
 
requires ownership and encourages accountability and engagement, such that all parties adopt 
a responsible attitude towards the process 
 
encourages creative thinking and organized efforts to identify opportunities for improving 
and learning from operating experience 
4.1.1 
Commitment to ALARA 
A policy committing to the ALARA principle should be adopted by licensees as evidence of 
compliance with paragraph 4(a) of the RPR. 
It is essential that all levels of management, particularly at the senior level, within a licensee’s 
organization commit to a policy of safety and sound radiation protection practices in order to 
keep all doses ALARA. This commitment should be made through written policy statements from 
the highest level of management and through clear and demonstrable support (e.g., management 
leadership) for those persons with direct responsibility for radiation protection in the workplace. 
Licensees should develop an approach to implement the ALARA policy commitment. In some 
instances, the application of sound radiation protection principles by well-trained employees will 
be all that is required to fulfill the policy statement in maintaining doses ALARA. 
To translate the policy commitment into effective action, licensees should identify appropriate 
organizational arrangements and assign clear responsibilities and authorities to implement them. 
Mechanisms should be in place to encourage all persons within the organization to be involved in 
the development of methods to keep doses ALARA, and to provide opportunities for them to give 
feedback on the effectiveness of radiation protection measures. 
Radiation protection is part of the safety culture of a licensee’s organization. Management has a 
role in fostering a safety culture in which everyone in the organization recognizes the importance 
of optimizing doses from exposure to radiation. Requirements and guidance for fostering and 
assessing safety culture are provided in REGDOC-2.1.2, Safety Culture [10]. 
4.1.2 
Allocation of resources 
As part of its policy commitment to ALARA, a licensee should contribute to the control of doses 
to persons by providing appropriate resources, both financial and human. 
The provision of appropriate resources from a financial perspective relates to adequate equipment 
and facilities to support radiation protection and financial means to implement ALARA 
initiatives. Economic factors are considered as part of the ALARA process and are discussed in 
more detail in subsection 4.1.4. The provision of human resources to support the application of 
ALARA may relate to staffing of supporting roles, such as oversight of radiation protection and 
ALARA (which is discussed in more detail in subsection 4.2), and training. In allocating 
appropriate human resources, licensees should ensure that staff have sufficient time to dedicate to 
the program. For this reason, care should be taken when assigning more than one role to an 
individual who has responsibilities for radiation protection and the application of ALARA. For 
some licensees, an integrated health and safety approach towards the application of ALARA (i.e., 
one in which the resources allocated to reduce radiological and non-radiological risks are 
considered together) would be advantageous. This approach prevents introducing dose reduction 
July 2021 
REGDOC-2.7.1, Radiation Protection 
 
6 
 
at the expense of controlling conventional risks that may have greater impact on health and 
safety. 
The best option for minimizing doses is always specific to the exposure situation and takes into 
account the best level of protection that can be achieved under the prevailing circumstances. The 
best option is usually a result of an evaluation (discussed further in subsection 4.1.3), which 
considers the detriment from the exposure against the resources available for enhancing the 
protection of individuals. Thus, the best option is not necessarily the one with the lowest dose. 
For example, in a case where doses are already at very low levels, the best option may be to put 
available resources towards enhancing other health and safety aspects for workers and the 
workplace, rather than towards additional dose reduction efforts. Furthermore, while the dose to 
some workers or work groups may be higher than the licensee’s average dose, the dose may 
already be considered ALARA, making further dose reduction efforts impractical for the given 
circumstance. Dose reduction efforts should not be directed solely at workers with the highest 
dose, as practical means of reducing dose may be found for other workers whose doses are lower. 
The CNSC may consider that an ALARA assessment is not required if, during the initial analysis, 
the licensee can demonstrate that: 
 
individual occupational doses are unlikely to exceed 1 mSv per year 
or 
 
doses to individual members of the public are unlikely to exceed 50 µSv per year 
If an ALARA assessment is not required, this would minimize the commitment of resources 
likely to result in limited safety improvements. 
4.1.3 
Process for the application of ALARA 
The application of the ALARA principle should be considered at all stages ‒ from design of 
facilities, processes, structures, systems and components, to construction, through to operation, 
decommissioning and waste management. The application of ALARA should be implemented by 
licensees through an ongoing, cyclical process (i.e., the optimization process or the ALARA 
process). It should include: 
 
evaluation of the exposure situation to identify the need for action (framing of the process) 
 
identification of the possible options to keep the exposure ALARA 
 
selection of the best option under the prevailing circumstances 
 
implementation of the selected option through an effective optimization program 
 
regular review of the exposure situation to evaluate if the prevailing circumstances call for 
the implementation of corrective actions 
 
Judgment of reasonableness is inherent in the ALARA process. Understanding, good practice and 
feasibility help in judging the reasonableness of an action: 
 
Understanding is based on experience, knowledge and the exercise of professional judgement 
(e.g., a very low-cost, practical change that reduces dose should be made even if doses are 
already low). 
 
Good practice considers the radiation protection practices and performance of other, similar 
operations.

 
Feasibility includes approaching improvements in radiation protection pragmatically (i.e., 
weighing cost versus benefits of implementing changes in accordance with their practical 
significance). 
ICRP Publication 101b, The Optimisation of Radiological Protection: Broadening the 
Process [11], provides some guidance on developing an optimization process. The following 
steps provide an example of a process for assessing options for achieving ALARA: 
1. Identify the exposure situation and make a preliminary analysis of the type and level of doses 
expected. 
2. Identify the radiation protection options (refer to section 4.4): 
a. Application of engineered controls (elimination of the hazard, use of shielding, distancing 
location of persons from sources of radiation, etc.) 
b. Application of administrative controls (restricting access and the time in proximity to 
sources of radiation, use of personal protective equipment (PPE), etc.) 
3. Quantify, where possible, the impact of the radiation protection options in terms of cost, dose, 
time, etc. (for some factors, a qualitative assessment may be necessary). 
4. Compare the options. 
5. Select and implement an optimized solution. 
6. Monitor performance of the implemented solution and reassess when warranted. 
Increases in dose levels are not normally expected if the circumstances of the exposure situation 
do not change. Changes may impact worker dose levels and are considered opportunities to 
revisit the ALARA option(s) being implemented for a given practice. Justification is required for 
any proposal that may result in a predicted increase in worker doses.

Taking into account social and economic factors 
The ALARA principle takes into account social and economic factors. Licensees are responsible 
for assessing and documenting the justification and rationale for how they will take these factors 
into account in the application of the ALARA principle in order to substantiate their decisions. 
Social factors that can be considered include equity, sustainability, individual benefit, social 
benefit and social trust. The views of the public may also be relevant. 
Economic factors can include, for example, the financial impact of protection measures as 
balanced against the benefit obtained. Some decisions on whether the efforts to reduce doses are 
economically justifiable may be made using cost-benefit analysis or other quantitative techniques. 
However, it may be inappropriate to solely consider quantitative arguments in judging 
reasonableness. A discussion of the monetary value of the unit collective dose can be found in 
IAEA Safety Reports Series No. 21, Optimization of Radiation Protection in the Control of 
Occupational Exposure [12], which provides guidance when such decisions are made. Additional 
guidance is found in ICRP Publication 55: Optimization and Decision-Making in Radiological 
Protection [13]. 
4.1.5 
Oversight of the application of ALARA 
The ALARA principle incorporates the notion that the level of effort that should be applied to 
optimize doses depends on the magnitude of projected or historical doses. The regular review of 
dose records and other appropriate indicators, such as the frequency of contamination incidents, 
July 2021 
REGDOC-2.7.1, Radiation Protection 
 
8 
 
form a critical part of the oversight of the application of ALARA. These reviews identify trends 
that enable licensees to evaluate the effectiveness of dose reduction efforts. 
As well as reviewing doses and other relevant statistics, licensees can demonstrate effective 
oversight of the application of ALARA by regularly reviewing information on new technologies 
and procedures that might enhance radiation protection measures. In a manner that is 
commensurate with the specific radiological risks, licensees should keep themselves informed of 
technological advances in protective equipment and instrumentation in order to identify improved 
methods for exposure monitoring and dose reduction. 
Licensees should also ensure that periodic internal reviews and inspections of the workplace are 
conducted by management to observe, first-hand, workers’ adherence to the established radiation 
protection and conventional safety practices. These inspections should be documented to capture 
the way in which the ALARA principle is being implemented. The information should be shared 
throughout the organization. 
Other measures that may be integrated into day-to-day operations by licensees to help oversee the 
application of the ALARA principle include the following examples: 
 
ALARA programs may help organize and document initiatives and activities, helping to 
demonstrate that actions are being taken to keep doses ALARA. 
 
Committees consisting of management and workers can be beneficial. Typically, committees 
will develop ALARA initiatives, review performance in achieving these initiatives, and 
discuss and review incidents. Multi-disciplinary membership should be considered, as this 
can increase awareness and engagement in ALARA initiatives throughout the organization. 
 
Setting ALARA performance targets and tracking performance against these targets enables 
management and workers to focus efforts on those areas of radiation protection that require 
improvement. A target may be defined in terms of a statistic such as average dose or 
collective dose during a specified period, or in terms of the frequency of an event (e.g., 
contamination incidents). The specified period is the time interval that has been chosen for 
monitoring performance (e.g., quarterly, semi-annually). A review of performance in meeting 
targets may also suggest that the licensee set more stringent targets for subsequent periods. 
ALARA performance targets should be established at set frequencies in accordance with a 
documented process. Progress towards achieving the targets should be monitored and 
appropriate corrective actions taken. Targets should be adjusted periodically to ensure that 
they are realistic. Targets should be challenging and forward-looking. 
 
Exposure control levels can be developed and documented into work planning and 
procedures ‒ for example, for the performance of a specific work activity. Work planning can 
include a work permit system and use of operating experience, trends and doses from 
previous jobs. Use of facility conditions and operating experience can allow licensees to plan 
actions and set conservative exposure control levels for work activities. This also allows for 
retrospective analysis following work activities, and for identifying and incorporating lessons 
learned into future work-planning activities.  
 
Dose constraints can be used prospectively in optimizing radiation protection in various 
situations encountered in planning and executing tasks, and in designing facilities or 
equipment. They should therefore be determined and documented on a case-by-case basis 
according to the specific characteristics of the exposure. Dose constraints may be in units of 
individual dose, collective doses or ambient dose rate. The process of deriving a dose 
constraint for any specific situation should include a review of operating experience and 
feedback from similar situations, if possible, as well as considerations of economic, social 
July 2021 
REGDOC-2.7.1, Radiation Protection 
 
9 
 
and technical factors. For occupational exposure, experience and benchmarking with industry 
best practices are of particular importance in setting dose constraints. 
4.2 
Management control over work practices 
Subparagraph 4(a)(i) of the RPR requires the implementation of management control over work 
practices as part of a radiation protection program. Licensees can best ensure that radiation 
protection program requirements are achieved if all levels of the organization ‒ managers and 
workers ‒ contribute constructively. The respective individual contributions of these persons will 
depend upon regulatory requirements and workers’ responsibilities as mandated by corporate 
decisions and structures. 
Responsibility for implementation of the radiation protection program should be allocated by 
management to staff as appropriate. The responsibilities of each hierarchical level (from top 
management to workers involved in specific tasks) regarding each aspect of the radiation 
protection program should be clearly delineated and documented in written policy statements, to 
ensure that all staff are aware of them. 
Licensees typically assign overall corporate responsibility for regulatory compliance and 
radiation protection matters to senior managers. In turn, these managers usually delegate routine 
responsibilities for the day-to-day administration and enforcement of radiation protection to 
suitably qualified staff. However, notwithstanding any such delegation, licensees remain legally 
responsible for compliance with CNSC regulatory requirements. 
Managers have responsibilities for ensuring the safety of staff, workers and the public during the 
conduct of licensed activities. Accordingly, managers at all levels should strive to promote a 
positive safety culture within the workplace and the organization at large. By promoting, 
implementing and enforcing appropriate policies, programs, practices, procedures and controls, 
managers can demonstrate both personal and corporate commitment to radiation protection in the 
workplace. 
Accordingly, managers should ensure that any staff assigned responsibilities for routine 
administration of radiation protection matters act effectively. Managers should encourage positive 
job performance by establishing adequate communication, reporting and supervision links with 
the staff involved. Managers should provide the authority as well as the physical and financial 
resources required to do the job. To reflect the importance of radiation protection, key staff with 
responsibilities for administration of the radiation protection program should report directly to a 
senior manager with adequate authority and resources. In order to achieve and maintain adequate 
standards of workplace safety, licensees’ senior management should provide any essential human, 
physical and financial resources. For example, senior managers of such institutions typically 
retain and assign persons to oversee and ensure radiation protection on a daily basis. 
Division of responsibilities for radiation protection 
Licensees should have a management policy and organizational structure related to the radiation 
protection program, and it should complement the policy considerations for ALARA, discussed in 
section 4.1.1. The description should include assignment of responsibilities for radiation 
protection to different management levels, as well as the necessary resources to support the 
program delivery. 
A description of the administrative organization of the radiation protection program, including 
authority and responsibility of each position, should be documented. The description should 
July 2021 
REGDOC-2.7.1, Radiation Protection 
 
10 
 
include the applicable responsibilities and the related activities to be conducted by individuals 
responsible for radiation protection. Experience and qualification requirements for each position 
responsible for conducting aspects of the radiation protection program should also be 
documented. 
Licensees should appoint a person(s) or position(s) within the organization to be responsible for 
the day-to-day administration and control of the radiation protection program on behalf of the 
employer. These positions include the following: a radiation safety officer (RSO); an RSO 
certified in accordance with section 15.04 of the Class II Nuclear Facilities and Prescribed 
Equipment Regulations, a position certified in accordance with subsection 9(2) of the Class I 
Nuclear Facilities Regulations, or any other position responsible for implementing radiation 
protection for the licensed activity. The necessary competence in terms of educational training 
and practical experience required for this position will vary according to the responsibilities 
assigned to the individual, and the magnitude, complexity or diversity of the licensed activities. 
Competence in radiation protection matters may be gained by completion of classroom 
instruction in radiation protection, relevant work experience, or any appropriate combination of 
formal training and practical experience. 
The qualifications and experience required of personnel who administer and enforce licensee 
radiation protection programs will vary accordingly. Additional information on requirements for 
RSOs may be found in section 4.3 and in the following CNSC regulatory documents: 
 
REGDOC-1.6.1, Licence Application Guide: Nuclear Substances and Radiation Devices, [4] 
 
REGDOC-1.4.1, Licence Application Guide: Class II Nuclear Facilities and Prescribed 
Equipment [6] 
 
REGDOC-2.2.3, Personnel Certification: Radiation Safety Officers [14] 
 
REGDOC-2.2.3, Volume III: Certification of Persons Working at Nuclear Power Plants [15] 
Positions that are delegated radiation protection responsibilities should not be assigned competing 
duties or priorities that might detract significantly from their ability or availability to participate 
in or to supervise radiation protection matters. 
4.3 
Personnel qualification and training 
Subparagraph 4(a)(ii) of the RPR requires the implementation of personnel training and 
qualification as part of a radiation protection program. Radiation protection knowledge and skills 
should be identified for and provided to all persons accessing the site of the licensed activity, 
including workers, radiation protection personnel, contractor personnel and visitors. Radiation 
protection training programs should be developed to accommodate the specific needs and 
requirements of the persons in each of these categories.  
REGDOC-2.2.2, Personnel Training [16], sets out the CNSC’s requirements for licensees 
regarding the development and implementation of a training system for nuclear facilities. The 
regulatory document also serves as a guideline for licensees holding Class II nuclear facilities and 
prescribed equipment licences or nuclear substances and radiation devices licences.  
The topics that should be covered by a training program, and the depth to which they should be 
addressed, will depend on the complexity of the licensed activity, the specific duties of workers, 
July 2021 
REGDOC-2.7.1, Radiation Protection 
 
11 
 
the radiological risk associated with those duties, as well as previous training and experience. 
Training should cover topics such as: 
 
risks associated with ionizing radiation 
 
basic quantities and units used in radiation protection 
 
radiation protection principles (ALARA, regulatory dose limits, etc.) 
 
fundamentals of practical radiation protection (time, distance, shielding, use of PPE, 
behaviour in designated areas, etc.) 
 
specific task-related issues 
 
responsibility to inform a designated person immediately in the event of any unforeseen 
occurrence involving increased radiological risk 
 
where appropriate, actions that may need to be taken in the event of an emergency 
Consideration should be given to the use of mock-ups or simulators for training.  
Workers’ knowledge of the fundamentals of radiation protection, their level of training and their 
competence to perform the specified tasks safely should be evaluated and determined to be 
adequate prior to any unsupervised assignment. Licensees should establish a process for the 
qualification of workers based on their knowledge, level of training and competence. 
Additional guidance on provision of training by work group is provided in appendix A. 
4.4 
Control of occupational and public exposure to radiation 
Subparagraph 4(a)(iii) of the RPR requires the implementation of measures for the control of 
occupational and public exposure to radiation as part of a radiation protection program. 
The preferred method of exposure control is through the elimination or reduction of the hazard. If 
elimination or significant reduction is not possible, the primary means of controlling occupational 
and public exposure to radiation is typically through engineered controls. When the use of 
physical design features, including specific engineered controls to limit radiation exposures, is 
impractical or inadequate, the implementation of administrative controls may need to be 
considered to ensure that protection is optimized. Examples of administrative controls are 
provided in section 4.4.2. 
Control measures such as quality in design, maintenance and operation, together with 
administrative arrangements and operating procedures/instruction, should be used to the 
maximum extent possible before relying on PPE for ensuring the protection of workers. In 
circumstances in which engineered and administrative controls are not sufficient to provide 
adequate levels of worker protection, PPE should be provided to minimize the exposures of the 
workers. Additional guidance on this topic is provided in section 4.4.4. 
See REGDOC-2.9.1, Environmental Principles, Assessments and Protection Measures [3], for 
information on measures for controlling radioactive releases to the environment to control public 
exposures. 
4.4.1 
Engineered controls for radiation protection 
To ensure radiation protection, licensees should provide essential facilities and equipment. These 
typically include a properly designed workplace as well as appropriate personnel safety, radiation 
monitoring and emergency response equipment. These provisions should be selected, designed, 
July 2021 
REGDOC-2.7.1, Radiation Protection 
 
12 
 
constructed, operated and maintained to ensure radiation protection while accommodating work 
activities. The design should account for frequently occupied locations, and support the need for 
human access to locations and equipment. Following the hierarchy of control, engineering 
considerations are preferred when elimination or substitution is not possible. 
From a radiological protection perspective, the licensee should assess the access requirements for 
operation, inspection, maintenance, repair, replacement and decommissioning of equipment; 
these considerations should be incorporated into the design. 
General guidance on design features for radiation protection is provided in the following 
subsections. Specific CNSC requirements and guidance on radiation protection in the design of 
Class II nuclear facilities, reactor facilities, radiography installations, nuclear substance 
laboratories and nuclear medicine rooms are found in the following CNSC regulatory documents: 


Equipment [6]

 
GD-52, Design Guide for Nuclear Substance Laboratories and Nuclear Medicine Rooms 
[19]1 
 
RD-367, Design of Small Reactor Facilities [20]2 
Shielding 
The provision of shielding can be an effective form of engineered control. At the design stage, 
adequate thickness of the shield material should be provided to give an acceptable level of 
protection to the workers during normal as well as abnormal situations. The adequacy of the 
shielding in abnormal conditions, including accident situations leading to maximum foreseeable 
(worst-case) radiological consequences, should be evaluated and, where necessary, additional 
shielding or other engineered controls (e.g., interlocks) should be considered. The effectiveness of 
the shielding should be actively monitored by installed workplace radiation dose-rate monitoring 
instruments and/or by regular area radiation dose rate surveys performed by suitably qualified 
personnel. Additional local shielding should be provided to reduce the radiation dose rates as 
needed. 
Ventilation and containment systems 
The primary ventilation system in a facility provides fresh air to the workplaces. Careful attention 
should be given to the design of the ventilation and containment systems network, including the 
calculation and verification of rates and velocities of air flow, to ensure that they are adequate for 
controlling airborne contamination. Installed fume hoods and glove boxes are also examples of 
engineered controls. For radioactive areas in a facility or activity where airborne contamination is

Handled. See the document history of REGDOC-2.5.6 for more information.

REGDOC-2.5.2 for more information. 
July 2021 
REGDOC-2.7.1, Radiation Protection 
 
13 
 
possible, the design philosophy of ventilation systems is to contain and confine nuclear 
substances by: 
 
maintaining adequate negative pressure with respect to the atmospheric pressure 
 
providing a directed flow of air from potentially lower radioactive areas to potentially higher 
radioactive areas 
 
providing an adequate number of air changes in the work atmosphere 
REGDOC-2.5.4, Design of Uranium Mines and Mills: Ventilation Systems [21], contains 
information for applicants on the CNSC requirements for the submission of ventilation-related 
information when applying for a licence to site and construct, operate or decommission a uranium 
mine or mill. 
Classification of areas and access control 
Facilities should be divided into zones based on considerations such as predicted dose rates, 
radioactive contamination levels, concentration of airborne nuclear substances, access 
requirements and any other specific requirements. 
Inter-zonal boundaries should be clearly marked, and radiation detection equipment available and 
used as required (for personnel, tools, equipment and material) at points of exit from radiation 
zones and/or contaminated zones. Provisions should be made for controlling the exit(s) from the 
radiation zones. Monitoring of personnel and materials should be established at the access and 
egress points for the radiation zones. Access to areas of high dose rates or high levels of 
radioactive contamination should be controlled through the provision of a robust barrier (for 
example, lockable doors and interlocks). Routes for personnel through radiation zones and 
contamination zones should be minimized in order to reduce the time spent in transiting these 
zones. Radiation zones where personnel spend substantial time should be designed to the lowest 
practical dose rates and ALARA. Within the radiation zones, changing areas for personnel should 
be provided at selected locations to prevent the spread of radioactive contamination. Within these 
changing areas, consideration should be given to the need for decontamination facilities for 
personnel, radiation monitoring instruments and storage areas for protective clothing. A physical 
barrier should clearly separate the clean area from the potentially contaminated area. 
4.4.2 
Administrative controls for radiation protection 
Examples of administrative controls for radiation protection include work procedures such as 
written safety policies, work authorizations (such as radiation work permits) and restrictions, 
access controls to areas with the potential for radiological hazards, and training. Administrative 
controls should have an emphasis on limiting the time spent by workers in proximity to the source 
of radiation, and increasing the distance between workers and the source of radiation. 
Administrative controls are only supplements to the engineered controls described in 
section 4.4.1. 
4.4.3 
Personal protective equipment 
Personal protective equipment (PPE) should be selected with due consideration of the hazards 
involved. The equipment should not only provide adequate protection, but should also be 
convenient and comfortable to use. Examples of PPE include reinforced clothing, ventilated suits, 
gloves, laboratory coats/smocks, and protective glasses. Workers who may have to use such 
July 2021 
REGDOC-2.7.1, Radiation Protection 
 
14 
 
equipment should be properly trained in its use, operation, maintenance and limitations. It is 
important that PPE fit the wearer correctly. 
Consideration should be made to determine if the benefit afforded by the PPE is outweighed by 
the consequence of wearing the equipment. All radiological hazard types, as well as conventional 
hazards, should be considered when selecting PPE. For example, the use of a respirator may 
provide the wearer a high degree of protection from intakes of radionuclides in the air. However, 
the respirator may impede the wearer’s mobility, thereby adding time to completing a task in a 
high-radiation area and leading to an elevated external dose. 
Licensees should ensure that their staff and workers have access to the personnel safety 
equipment that is necessary to limit radiation exposures in accordance with the ALARA principle, 
regulatory dose limits and corporate procedures. Since safety equipment needs may vary or 
fluctuate according to case-specific circumstances, the personnel safety measures should be 
reviewed at regular intervals to confirm whether they remain adequate. 
Several factors influence the success of PPE as a control measure. These include: 
 
selection of PPE for the task and the hazard, with regard to both the type and fit of PPE  
 
training in the use of PPE 
 
donning and doffing of PPE 
 
maintenance of PPE (maintenance includes storage, cleaning, inspection and 
disposal/replacement of PPE) 
PPE should be used and maintained in accordance with the manufacturer’s directions. 
Where there is the potential for contamination, PPE should be removed in suitable changing areas 
to control the spread of radioactive contamination. When contaminated PPE are stored, laundered 
or otherwise decontaminated or disposed of, licensees should put in place measures to prevent the 
spread of contamination to other persons or workplaces and to minimize the exposures of 
individuals and the release of contaminants to the environment. The licensee should provide 
suitable laundry facilities, boot washes, vacuum systems or other means of decontamination, as 
necessary. 
4.4.4 
Respiratory protection from airborne nuclear substances 
Respirators for protection from airborne nuclear substances should only be used if other hazard 
control methods are not practical or possible. Respirators should not be the first choice for dose 
reduction in workplaces. They should only be used: 
 
when the hierarchy of control is not possible (elimination, substitution, engineering or 
administrative controls) 
 
while engineering controls are being installed or repaired 
 
when emergencies or other temporary situations arise (e.g., infrequent maintenance 
operations) 
Before considering use of a respirator by workers, licensees should have a documented 
respiratory protection program that describes the proper procedures for selection, use (including 
fit testing) and care of respiratory protection equipment. The correct use of a respirator is just as 
important as the selection of the appropriate respirator. Licensees should align their respiratory 
protection programs with CSA standard Z94.4-18, Selection, Use and Care of Respirators [22]. 
July 2021 
REGDOC-2.7.1, Radiation Protection 
 
15 
 
A program for the care and maintenance of respirators should be established and include cleaning 
and sanitizing, inspection, testing and repair, storage and record keeping. Respirators should be 
cleaned and sanitized according to the manufacturer’s instructions or procedures authorized by 
the respiratory protection program in consultation with the respirator’s manufacturer. Respirators 
designed for a single use should be disposed of after use. 
Since respirator filters capture particles, cartridges and filters should be replaced on a regular 
basis as per the manufacturers’ recommendations. Re-use of cartridges should follow 
manufacturers’ recommendations and procedures. 
4.5 
Planning for unusual situations 
Subparagraph 4(a)(iv) of the RPR requires the implementation of planning for unusual situations 
as part of a radiation protection program. A situation is considered unusual when it is outside of 
routine operations for which work planning would be needed to maintain radiation doses ALARA 
and below the regulatory dose limits stipulated in sections 13 and 14 of the RPR. An unusual 
situation can include the potential for high doses where routine doses are low. For such 
operations, radiation protection efforts should be directed to reducing, to the extent possible, the 
probability of occurrence of events that can result in high doses. If the unusual situation cannot be 
managed within the dose limits prescribed in sections 13 and 14 of the RPR, then section 15 of 
the RPR would apply. 
Work plans should be developed for work in areas where existing or potential radiological 
hazards may result in workers accumulating significant doses. The radiation protection 
component of work plans should include sufficient information to guide the worker in executing 
the task safely and keeping their dose ALARA. This information should include the following as 
a minimum: 
 
Radiological surveys of the hazards present 
 
Estimates of optimum time to be spent by workers in radiation fields 
 
An estimate of doses to the workers involved 
 
Identification of protective equipment and clothing to be used 
 
Actions such as back-out, to be taken should the anticipated radiation fields (airborne 
radioactivity concentration, dose or dose rate) be exceeded 
Review of work plans by management, radiation protection staff, and those conducting the work, 
prior to and following execution of the work, also contribute to keeping the doses ALARA. 
Experience gained from the reviews done following the completion of a project can be used in 
planning future jobs of a similar nature, with a view to further reducing worker doses where 
possible. The level of review and approval of work plans should be commensurate with the 
potential or existing hazard level of the work activity.  
4.6 
Nuclear substances released as a result of a licensed activity 
Paragraph 4(b) of the RPR requires that, as part of a radiation protection program, licensees must 
ascertain the quantity and concentration of any nuclear substance released as a result of the 
licensed activity. This can be done by direct measurement as a result of monitoring or by 
estimating quantity and concentration, if the time and resources required for direct measurement 
outweigh the usefulness of that method. 
July 2021 
REGDOC-2.7.1, Radiation Protection 
 
16 
 
Appendix C provides guidance on contamination monitoring in order to ascertain quantities of 
nuclear substances in work areas or for release from a nuclear facility as a result of the licensed 
activity. 
For guidance on effluent and/or emission monitoring in order to ascertain quantities of nuclear 
substances for release from a nuclear facility, refer to REGDOC-2.9.1, Environmental Protection: 
Environmental Principles, Assessments and Protection Measures [3]. 
4.6.1 
Workplace monitoring programs  
Licensees should establish, maintain and review workplace monitoring under the radiation 
protection program. The type and frequency of workplace monitoring should allow for evaluation 
and review of the radiological conditions in all workplaces, as well as assessment of radiation 
exposures. It should also be based on dose rate, radioactivity concentration in air and surface 
contamination, and their expected fluctuations, and on the likelihood and magnitude of exposures 
in anticipated operational occurrences and accident conditions.  
Provisions for workplace monitoring within the radiation protection program should specify: 
 
the quantities to be measured 
 
where, when, and at what frequency the measurements are to be made  
 
the most appropriate measurement methods and procedures 
 
administrative and/or action levels, and the actions to be taken if they are exceeded 
This information should be used in support of pre- and post-job evaluations, work planning, 
contamination control and management of radiation dose rates. Significant changes in monitoring 
results should be identified and trends analyzed periodically. Corrective actions should be taken 
as necessary. 
Workplace monitoring records should be readily available to workers. 
Particular attention should be given to selection and use of instruments to ensure that their 
performance characteristics are appropriate for the specific workplace monitoring situation. This 
should include consideration of alarming capabilities of instrumentation where warranted. 
Guidance on considerations related to the selection, testing and calibration of radiation 
instrumentation and equipment are provided in section 25. 
Additional guidance on workplace monitoring programs is provided in appendix B. 
5. 
Ascertainment and Recording of Doses 
Section 5 of the RPR requires all licensees to ascertain and record doses assigned to anyone who 
performs duties associated with licensed activities or who is present at the site of licensed 
activities. This section introduces the approaches that may be used by licensees to ascertain and 
record radiation exposures and doses. Comprehensive guidance on ascertaining and recording 
doses, as required by section 5 of the RPR, is detailed in REGDOC-2.7.2, Dosimetry, Volume I: 
Ascertaining Occupational Dose [1]. 
Under paragraph 27(a) of the Nuclear Safety and Control Act (NSCA), every licensee is required 
to keep any records prescribed by the regulations under the NSCA, as well as a record of the dose 
received by or committed to each person who performs duties in connection with any activity that 
July 2021 
REGDOC-2.7.1, Radiation Protection 
 
17 
 
is authorized by the NSCA or who is present at a place where that activity is conducted. Radiation 
exposures due to naturally occurring nuclear substances must be considered only if those 
exposures occur as a direct result of a CNSC-licensed activity, such as exposures to radon and 
radon progeny in uranium mining and milling.  
Records of occupational exposure should be kept up to date, and procedures should be established 
to ensure that assessments of exposure from any monitoring period are incorporated into the 
individual’s exposure record promptly. 
Accordingly, CNSC licensees should keep the following dose-related records to satisfy regulatory 
requirements or to facilitate regulatory review: 
 
A record of the dose received by or committed to each person who performs duties in 
connection with any activity that is authorized by the NSCA or who is present at a place 
where that activity is carried on (paragraph 27(a) of the NSCA) 
 
A record of the time period over which the above dose was accumulated 
 
A description of the dosimetric model that was used to obtain the dose from measured data, 
as applicable 
 
Any other dosimetry record or information required by a condition of the licence, the NSCA 
or the CNSC pursuant to paragraph 3(1)(m) of the General Nuclear Safety and Control 
Regulations 
Retention periods for such records are discussed in section 24. 
5.1 
Methods to measure exposure and doses directly 
A radiation exposure or dose may be ascertained by direct measurement as a result of monitoring. 
A direct measurement typically involves the use or application of personal monitoring equipment 
and techniques. In each situation involving direct measurement as a result of monitoring, the 
choice of the most appropriate equipment and techniques will depend upon case-specific factors. 
Such factors include whether the source of the radiation that is to be measured is external to the 
person’s body, or whether it can be incorporated into the body (e.g., by inhalation or ingestion). 
For example, personal monitoring devices that are worn or carried on a person’s body (e.g., an 
optically stimulated luminescent dosimeter) can be used to directly measure the person’s 
exposure to radiation from sources that remain outside the body. Alternatively, a person’s 
exposure to radiation taken into the body may be ascertained by direct measurements on the body 
(e.g., in vivo measurements using instruments such as whole-body counters, thyroid probes, lung 
counters) or by direct measurements on material that is excreted, exhaled or otherwise sampled 
from the body (i.e., in vitro measurements of urine, feces and sputum). 
Typically, a radiation dose that is ascertained by direct measurement as a result of monitoring is 
reasonably representative of the actual dose received.  
5.2 
Methods to estimate exposures and doses 
A radiation exposure or dose may be estimated by indirect methods that take into account non-
personal monitoring results and other relevant data. 
For example, in a case in which a person occupies, for a known period of time, an area that has a 
known concentration of airborne radioactivity or a known radiation field, this knowledge can be 
July 2021 
REGDOC-2.7.1, Radiation Protection 
 
18 
 
used, in conjunction with other information, to estimate the person’s radiation exposure during 
that occupancy. This approach is often used where an airborne nuclear substance is the source of 
exposure. In such instances, the concentration in air of radon progeny or other radionuclides is 
measured by air sampling or another method, and the time spent in the area by a person is 
recorded. The measured concentrations of airborne radioactivity, the recorded period of 
occupancy, representative metabolic data, and air-inhalation rates are then used to estimate the 
exposures of the person to airborne radiation. 
5.3 
Direct measurement versus estimation of exposures and doses 
When deciding on whether to measure directly or to estimate a radiation exposure or radiation 
dose, licensees should take into account the advice of radiation protection experts, as well as any 
other relevant factors. The relevant factors can include:  
 
the number of workers involved 
 
the nature of the work activity and its processes 
 
the nature, number, activity and size of the associated radiation sources 
 
the magnitude, distribution and range of the anticipated radiation exposures or doses  
 
what techniques and equipment are available and suitable for measuring and monitoring the 
exposure or dose 
For situations that can involve radiation exposures or doses from multiple sources or via different 
pathways, licensees should determine which is appropriate for each contributing component: 
direct measurement as a result of monitoring, or estimation of the associated exposures or doses 
through indirect monitoring or dose modelling. 
The need for and appropriateness of direct monitoring of persons will depend on factors such as: 
 
the amount of nuclear substance present and the radionuclide(s) involved, or the maximum 
energy and potential dose rates to which persons will be exposed as a result of the operation 
of radiation devices and prescribed equipment, and the duration of their exposure 
 
the physical and chemical form of the nuclear substance, where applicable 
 
the type of containment or shielding used 
 
the operations performed 
 
the expected levels and likely variations in the dose rates, doses or intakes 
 
the complexity of the measurement and interpretation procedures that make up the 
measurement program 
 
general working conditions 
The need for direct monitoring is likely to be greater in the early stages of an operation. As 
experience in the workplace is gained, the need for routine direct monitoring can be reviewed to 
decide on the need for continuance of direct monitoring or whether estimation through workplace 
monitoring is sufficient for radiation protection purposes. Consideration should also be given to 
the potential for accidental exposures in determining the necessity for individual monitoring. 
Any proposal to ascertain dose by estimation should be technically sound and substantiated. The 
decision to estimate should be justified on the basis of the time and resources that would 
otherwise be required for direct measurement.

An estimation method should be consistent with good quality practices and accepted techniques, 
which are further described in REGDOC-2.7.2, Volume I [1]. 
5.4 
Dosimetry 
This section of the regulatory document introduces guidance on dosimetry and radiation 
protection program considerations. 
5.4.1 
External dosimetry 
External dosimetry is the measurement of dose when the radiation source is outside of (or 
external to) the body. External dosimeters should be used, handled and stored in accordance with 
radiation protection program requirements. Procedures should be in place to estimate the dose in 
the event of the loss of or damage to a dosimeter, or an unexpected/unusual dosimeter reading. 
Guidance on external dosimetry, including decisions on when to use external dosimetry, is 
provided in REGDOC-2.7.2, Volume I [1]. 
In general, wearing periods for external dosimetry should be determined considering the 
radiological hazards present in the facility, and the technical and performance specifications for 
the dosimeter type (e.g., minimum detection limits), as well as practical and logistical 
considerations. For licensed dosimetry, wearing periods should also be informed by consultation 
with the dosimetry service provider. Licensees who possess, use or produce exposure devices 
have specific requirements for dosimetry stipulated in paragraph 30(1)(c) and subsection 31(3) of 
the Nuclear Substances and Radiation Devices Regulations. 
5.4.2 
Internal dosimetry 
Internal dosimetry is the measurement of doses due to nuclear substances that have entered the 
body by way of ingestion, inhalation or other means. It may consist of measurements of the 
activity of radionuclides in the body (known as either in vivo monitoring or in vivo bioassay; the 
terms are equivalent), monitoring of excreta (known as either in vitro monitoring or in vitro 
bioassay), air sampling with personal air samplers, or a combination of these methods. 
Bioassay programs ensure that intakes of radionuclides are accurately determined and recorded, 
and in some instances, facilitate dose assignment. The primary objective of a bioassay monitoring 
program is to assess a worker’s body burden from exposure to radionuclides in order to ensure the 
safety of workers. 
The principal components of a bioassay monitoring program are the criteria for participation in 
the program, the frequency of monitoring, and the actions taken on the basis of measurement 
results. The type and frequency of bioassay sampling and measurement is based upon the 
likelihood of intake, the potential for large acute uptakes, and suitable dosimetry methods being 
available. Monitoring workers for potential intakes of radionuclides may be accomplished by 
either individual measurement methods or workplace measurements. 
Personal air sampling can also be performed to estimate breathing zone concentrations of 
radionuclides. If used for internal dose assignments, personal air sampling equipment should 
include the following elements as appropriate: equipment worn or located in an appropriate 
environment and position; a quality control program; a preventive maintenance program; and 
appropriate minimum detection limits.

Action Levels 
Section 6 of the RPR defines an action level as “a specific dose of radiation or other parameter 
that, if reached, may indicate a loss of control of part of a licensee's radiation protection program 
and triggers a requirement for specific action to be taken.” 
The definition of “action level” in the Uranium Mines and Mills Regulations encompasses both 
radiation protection and environmental protection, whereas the definition of “action level” in the 
RPR refers only to radiation protection. For the purposes of section 6 of the RPR, action levels 
are those developed for the parameters of the radiation protection program. See CSA standard 
N288.8-17, Establishing and Implementing Action Levels for Releases to the Environment From 
Nuclear Facilities [23], for more information on action levels for environmental protection. 
Action levels are designed to alert licensees before regulatory dose limits are reached. Action 
levels may be established as part of licensees’ radiation protection programs. Licensees are 
responsible for identifying the parameters of their program that represent timely indicators of 
potential losses of control of their program. For this reason, action levels are facility- or activity-
specific and can change with significant developments and/or fundamental changes in operational 
and radiological conditions. By definition, if an action level is reached, a loss of control of some 
part of the associated radiation protection program may have occurred, and specific action is 
required. If an action level is reached, the specified actions under the RPR are to establish the 
cause for reaching the action level; to determine the impact, if any, on the effectiveness of the 
radiation protection program; to restore the effectiveness of the radiation protection program (if 
required); and to notify the CNSC within a specified period of time. 
Exceeding an action level is not considered a non-compliance. The exceedance of an action level 
and the successful implementation of the required follow-up activities (notification, investigation 
and implementation of corrective actions) to restore the effectiveness of the program is a clear 
demonstration of due diligence and of a well-maintained and well-managed control system. 
However, failure to inform the CNSC, complete an investigation and implement corrective 
actions (if required) is considered non-compliance. 
It is important to note that occasional exceedances indicate that the action level chosen is likely 
an adequately sensitive indicator of a potential loss of control of the radiation protection program. 
Action levels that are never exceeded may not be sensitive enough to detect the emergence of a 
potential loss of control. For this reason, licensee performance is not based on the number of 
action level exceedances in a given period, but rather on how the licensee responds and identifies 
corrective actions (if required) to enhance program performance and prevent recurrence. 
CNSC licensees may use action levels to help them monitor and maintain the effectiveness of the 
radiation protection programs. In particular, licensees may set action levels and monitor related 
parameters. so as to provide early warnings of any actual or potential losses of control of the parts 
of the radiation protection program to which the action levels apply. This maximizes 
opportunities for follow-up investigations and any interventions that may be necessary to restore 
control. 
July 2021 
REGDOC-2.7.1, Radiation Protection 
 
21 
 
Action levels may be expressed in terms of any parameters that, if reached, may indicate a loss of 
control of an associated part of the licensee’s radiation protection program. Some examples of 
such parameters are: 
 
the quantity of radiation exposure or dose that an individual receives (“individual dose”) 
 
a radiation level within a work area (“ambient dose rate”) 
 
radioactivity per unit surface area (“surface contamination level”) 
 
an air-exchange rate in a workplace (“ventilation rate”) 
 
a concentration or a quantity of a nuclear substance in a workplace 
Action levels are typically facility- or activity-specific. An action level value for a particular 
parameter for one licensee may lie within the normal operating range of another licensee. Over 
the lifetime of a facility or activity, an action level may be dynamic or static. That is, it may be 
revised upwards or downwards to accommodate the prevailing circumstances. For example, an 
action level for a new facility or activity may warrant refinement once sufficient operating 
experience is gained. Similarly, if conditions at a facility change, a related action level may also 
need to be reviewed and revised accordingly. 
Licensees are encouraged to develop administrative levels in conjunction with their action levels. 
Administrative levels are internal tools for dose monitoring and control, and exceedances of these 
levels do not typically require reporting to the CNSC. Administrative levels are usually set based 
on the expected high end of normal operations or based on the statistics from past performance 
for similar work activities. The exceedance of an administrative level should trigger an internal 
investigation and disposition according to the licensee’s corrective action program. 
6.1 
Developing, using and revising action levels 
Typically, an action level for a nuclear facility or licensed activity will be developed as part of the 
CNSC licensing process, in accordance with paragraph 3(l)(f) of the General Nuclear Safety and 
Control Regulations.  
If it is to be useful and credible, an action level must be a meaningful indicator of the state of a 
radiation protection program over a defined time period. An action level for a nuclear facility 
should take into account the facility’s design and relevant operating experience. A licence 
applicant who lacks such experience, as in the case of new activities or operations, may be able to 
draw upon the experience of comparable designs and operations. To facilitate regulatory review 
of any proposed action level, the licence applicant should thoroughly and clearly explain the 
rationale for the level and its planned use. 
Accordingly, the following steps for developing and using action levels may be helpful: 
 
From the design, identify those processes and activities that can result in doses to workers or 
the public. 
 
For activities and processes that can result in doses to workers or the public, identify the 
measurable parameters that will indicate, directly or indirectly, whether the radiation 
protection program is adequately controlled. 
 
On the basis of realistic assumptions, select appropriate action levels, expressed in terms of 
the appropriate parameters, for all key processes and activities.  
 
Incorporate use of the selected action levels into the proposed radiation protection program. 
 
Implement the radiation protection program and the associated action levels in accordance 
with the CNSC licence. 
July 2021 
REGDOC-2.7.1, Radiation Protection 
 
22 
 
 
As operating experience accumulates, revise action levels accordingly as needed to ensure 
that they remain a meaningful indicator of a potential loss of control of the radiation 
protection program. 
The radiation protection program should include requirements for regular review of ‒ and when 
appropriate, revision of ‒ action levels. To revise an action level that is referenced in a licence, 
the licensee must obtain an appropriate licensing action from the CNSC, such as a licence 
amendment or revision to the licence conditions handbook. When applying for this action, the 
applicant should demonstrate that the proposed revision is appropriate for the purposes of 
section 6 of the RPR and any relevant requirements of the licence. 
6.2 
Monitoring 
To serve as an effective indicator of a possible loss of control of a part of a radiation protection 
program, an action level must be supported by a monitoring program that can accurately detect 
when the action level is reached. Accordingly, licence applications that include any proposed 
action level should also describe the monitoring program that the applicant plans to implement in 
order to detect when the action level is reached. 
Since the purpose of monitoring action levels is to provide timely warning of any potential or 
actual loss of control of part of the radiation protection program, a corresponding monitoring 
proposal should consist of an appropriate methodology and frequency of sampling or 
measurement. This selection of methodology and frequency will be influenced by case-specific 
factors and should be commensurate with the probability and consequences of a loss of control of 
a part of the radiation protection program. For example, as the probability increases that 
regulatory dose limits are approached or exceeded as a consequence of a loss of control of part of 
a radiation protection program, more rigorous action level monitoring programs may be 
appropriate. 
When a proposal for an action level is accepted and incorporated into a CNSC licence, the 
licensee must ensure that the program is implemented and maintained in accordance with the 
licence. 
6.3 
Responding when an action level is reached 
When an action level referred to in a licence is reached, specific actions are required pursuant to 
subsection 6(2) of the RPR. The licensee must conduct an investigation to determine the cause, 
take action to restore the effectiveness of the radiation protection program if required, and notify 
the CNSC within the time period specified in the licence. 
Although an action level is not an enforceable dose limit, a failure to meet the above obligations 
would contravene the RPR and would constitute an offence under the NSCA. 
Reaching an action level can occur due to any number of causes. An action level may be reached 
repeatedly as a consequence of chronic deficiencies in the associated radiation protection 
program. Ongoing occurrences can be triggered by a shift in normal operating conditions. 
Occasional occurrences can be triggered by transient conditions that might not relate to a loss of 
control of the radiation protection program or to a significant change in the radiation doses 
associated with normal operating conditions. For any of the above cases, repeatedly reaching an 
action level would be cause for additional analysis and may be an indicator that either the action 
July 2021 
REGDOC-2.7.1, Radiation Protection 
 
23 
 
level is not set appropriately, or that the corrective actions implemented have not been effective in 
restoring control of the radiation protection program. 
The investigation that a licensee undertakes to determine why an action level referred to in a 
licence has been reached may first need to confirm whether the evidence (e.g., measurements, 
observations or calculations) that indicates that the action level has been reached is valid (i.e., 
whether the action level has indeed been reached). 
Further to determining the cause for reaching an action level, the licensee must identify and take 
actions to restore the effectiveness of the radiation protection program. These actions should be 
appropriate to the circumstances and commensurate with the level of risk associated with the 
reaching of the action level. If the licensee cannot restore effectiveness immediately, the licensee 
should propose interim measures for CNSC consideration. The measures to restore the 
effectiveness of the radiation protection program, whether interim or final, should be based on 
credible experience, data or analyses, and should take into account the consequences of the loss 
of control. 
Typically, the greater the radiological hazards that result when an action level is reached, the 
more immediate, complex or rigorous the measures will be to restore the effectiveness of the 
radiation protection program. 
In addition to the above responses when an action level is reached, paragraph 6(2)(c) of the RPR 
requires the licensee to notify the CNSC within the period specified by the licence. 
7. 
Provision of Information to Nuclear Energy Workers 
Section 7 of the RPR requires licensees to provide certain information to all nuclear energy 
workers (NEWs). 
There is an obligation on licensees to identify individuals as NEWs. In accordance with the 
NSCA, a NEW is any person that is required, in the course of their business or occupation in 
connection with a nuclear substance or nuclear facility, to perform duties in such circumstances 
that there is a reasonable probability that the person may receive a dose greater than the 
prescribed limit for the general public (which is 1 mSv per calendar year). There is no provision 
in the NSCA or its regulations that sets out the process for determining whether a person is a 
NEW. The licensee is responsible for determining whether a person meets the definition of a 
NEW under the NSCA and its regulations. This requires that a case-by-case determination be 
made, based on the potential occupational exposure related to the duties that will be performed by 
the person for the licensee. Licensees should also be aware that the Canada Labour Standards 
Regulations allow the employment of persons under the age of 17 as long as it “is not work as a 
nuclear energy worker as defined in the NSCA” (subparagraph 10(1)(b)(iii)). 
The risk information provided to NEWs should be relevant to the radiological risks that they may 
encounter during regular work activities. Licensees should provide risk information to NEWs 
prior to NEWs commencing their work activities, as practicable. As a best practice, risk 
information should be offered to all persons working where licensed activities are taking place. 
Risk information may be provided in either electronic or paper format. NEWs must also be 
provided with information on the applicable effective dose limits and equivalent dose limits 
prescribed in sections 13, 14 and 15 of the RPR.  
July 2021 
REGDOC-2.7.1, Radiation Protection 
 
24 
 
Licensees are required to inform NEWs of their dose levels. The dose levels are the radiation 
doses (effective and equivalent) that have been ascertained and recorded by a licensee (as 
required by section 5 of the RPR) for a NEW as a result of the NEW performing the duties 
associated with the licensed activity. See section 5 for additional guidance on ascertaining and 
recording doses. 
Dose levels must be communicated annually to NEWs in writing. That is, licensees must provide 
NEWs with their dose results for the current dosimetry period at least once per year, or more 
frequently if desired (e.g., monthly or quarterly). Dose levels may be communicated in either 
electronic or paper format. Workers are informed of their dose levels in order to ensure that they 
are aware of their exposure results relative to the dose limits for a given year, that they understand 
their specific situation, and that they know who to contact if they have questions or concerns. An 
informed workforce leads to a stronger culture of safety and individual accountability. The 
licensee’s radiation protection program should document how workers are informed of their dose 
levels. The process should be reviewed periodically to ensure that it is effective.  
Licensees’ obligations to inform NEWs of their dose levels do not cease if the NEW’s 
employment ends (e.g., end of contract, retirement or termination) during the course of a year. 
Licensees must make reasonable efforts to inform any NEW who has left their employment of 
their radiation dose levels once this information is available. 
Licensees must inform all NEWs, in writing (in either electronic or paper format), of their 
responsibilities during an emergency, including the risks associated with radiation to which the 
worker may be exposed during the control of an emergency. Commensurate with licensee 
emergency plans, licensees should provide training to workers as necessary to meet this 
regulatory requirement. Some workers may simply need to be trained in evacuation procedures, 
whereas others may require training related to their specific roles during emergencies. Certain 
licensees would also need to provide this information to offsite authorities’ emergency response 
personnel, who may be expected to assist during an emergency. Training of emergency response 
personnel is also discussed in appendix A.7. 
Licensees must inform each female NEW, in writing (in either electronic or paper format): 
 
of the risks associated with the exposure of embryos and fetuses to radiation 
 
of the risks to breastfed infants from intakes of nuclear substances 
 
of the importance of informing the licensee, upon becoming aware of her pregnancy or if she 
is breastfeeding 
 
of the female NEW’s rights, specified in section 11 of the RPR, if they are pregnant or 
breastfeeding 
Providing this information to female NEWs will assist them in deciding if and when they will 
inform the licensee that they are pregnant or breastfeeding.  
Once a female NEW notifies the licensee in writing (in either electronic or paper format), the 
licensee must assess working conditions and, where necessary, make accommodations to ensure 
that the dose limit for a pregnant NEW is respected, and to limit the potential for intakes of 
nuclear substances by the breastfeeding worker. See section 11 for more information on 
accommodations for pregnant or breastfeeding NEWs. 
All NEWs must provide written acknowledgement to the licensee, attesting that they have been 
informed of their NEW status and the corresponding radiological risks commensurate with their 
July 2021 
REGDOC-2.7.1, Radiation Protection 
 
25 
 
work. Written acknowledgement may be provided in either electronic or paper format. In 
addition, each female NEW must provide written acknowledgement that she has been informed of 
the risks associated with the exposure of embryos and fetuses to radiation and of the risks to 
breastfed infants from intakes of nuclear substances, and that she has been informed of the 
importance of informing the licensee, in writing, upon becoming aware of her pregnancy or if she 
is breastfeeding. Records of written acknowledgments by NEWs must be retained by the licensee 
in accordance with subsection 28(1) of the General Nuclear Safety and Control Regulations. 
8. 
Requirement To Use a Licensed Dosimetry Service 
Section 8 of the RPR requires licensees to use a CNSC-licensed dosimetry service to measure and 
monitor the doses of radiation received by and committed to NEWs who have a reasonable 
probability of receiving: 
 
an effective dose greater than 5 mSv in a one-year dosimetry period 
 
an equivalent dose to the skin, or to the hands and feet, that is greater than 50 mSv in a one-
year dosimetry period  
These requirements ensure that doses are monitored with sufficient accuracy and precision. For 
more information on requirements relating to licensed dosimetry services, see REGDOC-2.7.2, 
Dosimetry, Volume II: Technical and Quality Management System Requirements for Dosimetry 
Services [2]. 
 
When determining when licensed dosimetry is required, licensees should consider the anticipated 
doses to be received as a result of the worker’s duties for a given licensed activity. An 
occupational dose that may have been received by the NEW under another licensee’s program is 
not used in the determination of whether licensed dosimetry is required. Instead, the NEW’s 
previous dose history is used by the licensee to ensure that the regulatory dose limits are not 
exceeded. Additional guidance on this subject is provided in section 10. 
Licensees are required to ascertain doses to all persons who are exposed to radiation due to the 
licensed activity, even if NEWs may not have a reasonable probability of receiving an effective 
dose greater than 5 mSv in a one-year dosimetry period or an equivalent dose to the skin or the 
hands and feet greater than 50 mSv in a one-year dosimetry period. Licensees may choose to use 
a CNSC-licensed dosimetry service, or other dosimetry methods for ascertaining doses in these 
circumstances. Section 5 of this regulatory document provides additional guidance on 
ascertaining and recording doses, and dosimetry methods are elaborated further in 
REGDOC-2.7.2, Volume I [1]. 
To determine whether NEWs have a reasonable probability of receiving an effective dose greater 
than 5 mSv in a one-year dosimetry period, or an equivalent dose to the skin or the hands and feet 
greater than 50 mSv in a one-year dosimetry period, licensees may estimate the expected doses, 
refer to the typical doses received at similar licensed facilities or activities, or benchmark with 
similar/historical doses received by NEWs in connection to their licensed activity. 
All radiation dose components and pathways that comprise the total effective dose to NEWs (i.e., 
internal dose and external dose) must be considered in determining whether to use a CNSC-
licensed dosimetry service. If there is a reasonable probability that the effective dose to a NEW, 
from a single contributing dose component, will exceed 5 mSv in a one-year dosimetry period, a 
licensed dosimetry service must be used to ascertain the NEW’s effective dose from that 
July 2021 
REGDOC-2.7.1, Radiation Protection 
 
26 
 
component. For example, if a NEW is only exposed to a sealed source which presents an external 
radiological hazard that may result in an effective dose to the NEW exceeding 5 mSv, then a 
whole-body dosimeter, licensed by the CNSC, must be used to ascertain the external dose. If 
there is a reasonable probability that the effective dose to a NEW from more than one 
contributing dose component will exceed 5 mSv in a one-year dosimetry period, licensees should 
use CNSC-licensed dosimetry services, if available and practicable, to measure each dose 
component that is likely to contribute more than 1 mSv towards the total effective dose. If there is 
no licensed dosimetry technique available for a given dose pathway, or the benefits of using the 
licensed dosimetry service outweigh the usefulness of the dose result, licensees should propose a 
method to estimate the doses received, as part of their licence application. Non-licensed 
dosimetry methods should be developed using quality requirements described in REGDOC-2.7.2, 
Volume I [1]. If the effective dose to a NEW is likely to be less than 1 mSv in a one-year 
dosimetry period, the effective dose may be ascertained using CNSC-licensed dosimetry or by 
other dosimetry methods (direct, indirect or dose modelling). 
Hands and feet (also referred to as extremities) should be monitored when they are preferentially 
exposed in exposure situations, and there is uncertainty as to whether the criterion for licensed 
dosimetry applies. If there is a reasonable probability of receiving an equivalent dose greater than 
50 mSv to the skin, hands or feet, a radiation monitoring instrument may be used to determine if 
licensed dosimetry is needed. Another option is to use direct monitoring for the skin, hands, or 
feet and assess whether it is necessary to use licensed dosimetry based on the results.  
Licensees who use a licensed dosimetry service are required to provide certain personal 
information to the dosimetry service operator with respect to each NEW, including the worker’s 
given names, surname and any previous surname; the worker’s social insurance number; the 
worker’s gender (i.e., categories of male, female, and X, which aligns with Service Canada’s 
practices for collecting such information); the worker’s job category; and the worker’s date, 
province and country of birth. Where dose measurements are recorded by a licensed dosimetry 
service, records for NEWs are submitted to the National Dose Registry (NDR)3, along with this 
specific personal information. An individual’s dose that has been submitted to the NDR is 
commonly referred to as a “dose of record.” 
The specific personal information of the NEW, collected by the licensee, facilitates the 
transmission of dose information to the NDR by dosimetry services licensed by the CNSC. All of 
the information listed is required in order to avoid errors in the maintenance of occupational 
exposure records in the NDR. For example, every NEW must be assigned a job category that is 
compatible with those used in the NDR. Job category designations are selected by each licensee 
based on a standard list maintained by the NDR. Some licensees may have their own job 
classifications schemes; however, they need to be translated into the NDR’s standardized list. Job 
                                                     
 
 
3 The NDR is a database owned and operated by Health Canada, which tracks the lifetime dose history of 
registered individuals. Health Canada provides the CNSC with access to the NDR and informs the CNSC 
of any records indicating that a dose limit has been exceeded. Prompt identification of such records allows 
the CNSC to act immediately to ensure that licensees have taken appropriate actions. Access to the NDR 
allows the CNSC to gain information on trends of dose data for facilities or groups of facilities, detailed 
dose information for individuals and licensees, and necessary information for health studies, including 
epidemiological studies. 
 
July 2021 
REGDOC-2.7.1, Radiation Protection 
 
27 
 
categories compatible with the NDR are available to licensees from dosimetry services licensed 
by the CNSC. 
9. 
Collection of Personal Information 
Section 9 of the RPR requires that if a licensee collects personal information, as defined in 
section 3 of the Privacy Act, that may be required to be disclosed to the Commission, another 
government institution as defined in that section, or a dosimetry service, the licensee must inform 
the person to whom the information relates why it is being collected. 
Although there are no specific requirements under the NSCA, any personal information collected 
as a result of the licensed activity is subject to protection under the Privacy Act. 
10. 
Obligations of Nuclear Energy Workers 
As per section 10 of the RPR, every NEW must, on request by the licensee, inform the licensee of 
their given names, surname and any previous surname; social insurance number; gender; date, 
province and country of birth; and dose record for the current one-year and five-year dosimetry 
periods. This information provided by every NEW facilitates various obligations of the licensee 
under the RPR. 
The NEW’s dose records may be obtained from the NDR with the individual’s written 
permission. However, the information in the NDR may not contain information on doses received 
by the NEW outside of Canada or doses ascertained through estimation and dosimetry methods 
that are not licensed by the CNSC. For this reason, as a best practice, the licensee should also 
request information on any doses received by the NEW in the one-year and five-year dosimetry 
period that may not be included in the NDR, in order to take doses into consideration for 
optimization purposes. 
The licensee uses the dose record for the current one-year and five-year dosimetry periods to 
properly control the worker’s dose for the remainder of the one-year and five-year dosimetry 
period and ensure compliance with the regulatory dose limits provided in sections 13 and 14 of 
the RPR. The radiation protection program should provide instructions for the use of this 
information, including related dose control measures. The radiation protection program should 
also specify restrictions on the work that may be conducted by the NEW until the complete dose 
record is obtained. 
11. 
Pregnant and Breastfeeding Nuclear Energy Workers 
Section 11 of the RPR specifies the rights of pregnant and breastfeeding NEWs.  
When a licensee is informed, in writing, that a NEW is pregnant or breastfeeding, the licensee is 
required to make the necessary accommodations or adaptations to the working conditions that 
will not cause undue financial hardship or business inconvenience. The requirements only relate 
to the duty to accommodate the NEW with respect to radiation protection. The accommodations 
will cease when the licensee is informed by the NEW that they are no longer pregnant or 
breastfeeding.  
The duty to make accommodations for pregnant and breastfeeding NEWs is not meant to prevent 
the worker from entering or working in a designated radiation and/or contamination zone. 
July 2021 
REGDOC-2.7.1, Radiation Protection 
 
28 
 
Accommodations should, however, ensure that under normal operating conditions, the dose to the 
NEW is kept ALARA and that the dose limits are respected. The revised working conditions 
should also ensure that, in the event of an accident or other event, any radiological exposure 
(internal or external) that may result in a dose above the dose limit is avoided.  
The licensee will also need to identify if the pregnant or breastfeeding NEW needs further 
information and training as a result of any change of working conditions related to 
accommodations made pursuant to section 11 of the RPR. 
Once informed by a NEW that she is pregnant or breastfeeding, the licensee should also redefine 
the dosimetry monitoring program for the NEW. For example, a shorter monitoring period (i.e., a 
greater frequency) may be necessary in order to monitor and control radiological exposures, 
including possible inadvertent exposures to the NEW. A wearing period for an external dosimeter 
worn by a pregnant NEW should be chosen in consideration of the technical and performance 
specifications for the dosimeter type (e.g., minimum detection limit). An active dosimeter – i.e., a 
direct reading dosimeter (DRD) – may also be used to help control radiological exposures. 
Modification of the monitoring program for internal exposures may also be necessary for both 
pregnant and breastfeeding NEWs, especially in consideration of nuclear substances handled by 
the worker that may be of more relevance for a developing embryo, fetus, or infant.  
11.1 
Accommodations for nuclear energy workers who are pregnant 
Once informed of a pregnancy, the licensee must ensure that the working conditions of the 
pregnant NEW will be such that her external exposures to, and intakes of, nuclear substances are 
kept ALARA and remain below the effective dose limit of 4 mSv for the balance of her 
pregnancy. Therefore, the licensee will need to review the pregnant NEW’s work practices, 
including the nuclear substances handled, in order to identify where accommodations can be 
made to limit the radiological exposures of the pregnant NEW and, by extension, of the embryo 
or fetus. Accommodations can include changes to work assignments that significantly reduce or 
eliminate the pregnant NEW’s potential for radiological exposures. Other options can be the use 
of shielding, PPE, and respiratory protection by the pregnant NEW. The licensee should inform 
the pregnant NEW of the accommodations to be made, including if there is a need to apply more 
stringent work restrictions to ensure that the effective dose limit for the pregnant NEW is 
respected, and that the radiological exposure of the embryo or fetus during pregnancy is kept 
ALARA. Furthermore, working conditions should be adapted so as to avoid any significant 
potential exposure due to accidents or other events that may result in high radiation doses 
received by the pregnant NEW from an external or internal exposure.  
For external exposures, radiation doses to an embryo and/or fetus tend to be lower than the dose 
received by the pregnant NEW due to protection afforded by the uterus and surrounding tissues. 
Special consideration should be given to situations where an intake of a nuclear substance by a 
pregnant NEW is possible. In these cases, it is important to be aware that some nuclear 
substances, if taken into the body of the pregnant NEW, may be absorbed more readily by the 
tissues of the placenta, resulting in a higher committed effective dose and/or equivalent dose to a 
sensitive organ of the embryo or fetus, when compared to that of the pregnant NEW. The 
gestational age of the embryo and fetus will also influence the resultant dose received by it. For 
example, exposure of the pregnant NEW to volatile radioiodine (e.g. iodine-125 and iodine-131) 
can result in an internal dose to the pregnant NEW as well as an elevated equivalent dose to the 
fetal thyroid (because of fetal organ sensitivity). In addition to radioiodines, intakes of other 
nuclear substances by the pregnant NEW that may result in a higher committed effective dose 
and/or equivalent dose to an organ of an embryo or fetus include: tritiated water, carbon-14, 
July 2021 
REGDOC-2.7.1, Radiation Protection 
 
29 
 
sulfur-35, phosphorus-32, and isotopes of calcium and strontium. If the pregnant NEW’s work 
activities involve any of these nuclear substances, additional steps should be taken to implement 
controls to completely avoid intakes, to the extent possible. This may include more stringent work 
restrictions and possible cessation of work activities with these nuclear substances by the 
pregnant NEW. ICRP Publication 88, Doses to the Embryo and Fetus From Intakes of 
Radionuclides by the Mother [24], provides dose coefficients for the embryo and fetus, and can 
be consulted by licensees for calculating doses to a developing embryo or fetus from intakes of 
nuclear substances by a pregnant NEW. Licensees may use this information when preparing risk 
information to provide to pregnant NEWs pursuant to section 7 of the RPR. Further, such dose 
calculations can be used to inform decisions on necessary accommodations and possible work 
restrictions for the pregnant NEW such that doses to the embryo or fetus remain ALARA for the 
duration of the pregnancy.  
There are radiation-related risks throughout pregnancy that are related to the stage of pregnancy 
and absorbed dose. Radiation risks are most significant during organogenesis and in the early 
fetal period, somewhat less in the second trimester, and least in the third trimester. Prenatal 
exposure to ionizing radiation may induce brain damage in embryos/fetuses following an acute 
dose exceeding 100 mSv between weeks 8 and 15 of pregnancy, or following an acute dose 
exceeding 200 mSv between weeks 16 and 25 of pregnancy, as these time periods are important 
for the development of the central nervous system. Before week 8 or after week 25 of pregnancy, 
human studies have not shown radiation risk to fetal brain development. Epidemiological studies 
indicate that the cancer risk (i.e., all childhood cancers) after fetal exposure to radiation is similar 
to the risk after exposure in early childhood. For more information, see the World Health 
Organization’s fact sheet Ionizing Radiation, Health Effects and Protective Measures [25]. 
11.2 
Accommodations for nuclear energy workers who are breastfeeding 
A licensee that is informed by a NEW that she is breastfeeding must make necessary 
accommodations to the breastfeeding NEW’s working conditions in order to limit intakes of 
nuclear substances by the breastfeeding NEW. The licensee will need to review the breastfeeding 
NEW’s work practices, including the nuclear substances handled, when identifying 
accommodations to be taken to limit her intakes of nuclear substances. This will ensure that the 
dose to the breastfed infant remains ALARA. In assessing whether an intake by the NEW may 
result in a dose to the breastfed infant, the licensee should be aware that certain nuclear 
substances, when taken into the body, are more likely to become concentrated in breast milk and 
that the dose to the infant may be more elevated relative to the dose received by the breastfeeding 
NEW (for example, in the cases of tritiated water, sulfur-35, iodine-125 and iodine-131). 
Additional information on assessing the dose to a breastfed infant can be found in 
REGDOC-2.7.2, Volume I [1].  
Accommodations made by the licensee to limit intakes of nuclear substances by the breastfeeding 
NEW can include changes to work assignments such that the potential for intakes is significantly 
reduced or eliminated. Other options can be the use of PPE and respiratory protection by the 
NEW. The licensee should inform the breastfeeding NEW of any accommodations to be made. In 
the event that an intake occurs, the licensee should assess the dose to the breastfeeding NEW and 
the resultant dose to the infant in the event that the NEW wants to continue to breastfeed. The 
licensee should advise the NEW of the associated risks of continuing to breastfeed, and if 
necessary, make recommendations to stop breastfeeding for a period of time to ensure that the 
dose to the infant is kept ALARA. For work activities that do not have the potential for intakes of 
nuclear substances, no accommodations for a NEW who is breastfeeding are required.

12. 
Interpretation of Radiation Dose Limits 
Section 12 of the RPR specifies that for the purposes of sections 13 and 14, doses of radiation 
include those received from X-rays or other artificially produced sources of radiation. Therefore, 
a person’s total dose, for the purposes of compliance with this requirement, must include any 
components received occupationally as X-rays or from any other artificially produced sources of 
ionizing radiation. Artificially produced sources refer to sources that are inherently tied to a 
CNSC-licensed facility/activity and to which the workers are exposed as a result of their 
occupation. Examples of licensees who would be affected include those who employ 
radiographers who also perform non-destructive testing using X-ray machines, and hospital staff 
in nuclear medicine departments who work with dual modality imaging devices and/or in 
proximity to radiology departments. 
13. 
Effective Dose Limits 
Effective dose is the sum of doses, measured in sieverts, received from external radiation 
exposures and committed doses from intakes of radioactive substances, during the same time 
period. Effective dose limits are in place to reduce the risk of stochastic effects, which may lead 
to later effects or illness such as cancer. Stochastic effects are effects that occur by chance with a 
probability that is proportional to the dose magnitude. 
Section 13 of the RPR establishes the effective dose limits for a NEW, a pregnant NEW and a 
person who is not a NEW. As required by subsection 13(1) of the RPR, every licensee must 
ensure that the effective dose received by and committed to a person described in column 1 of the 
table to this subsection, during the period set out in column 2, does not exceed the effective dose 
set out in column 3.

The ICRP recommends that dose limits for workers should be set in such a way and at such a 
level that the total effective dose received by an individual during a full working life will not 
exceed about 1 sievert (Sv), received somewhat uniformly year by year. The application of the 
radiological protection system should be such that this lifetime dose (1 Sv over a full working 
life) would rarely be approached. Annual dose limits have historically been used as a means of 
July 2021 
REGDOC-2.7.1, Radiation Protection 
 
31 
 
managing exposures over time. In 1990, to allow for further flexibility, the ICRP introduced a 
limit for effective dose that applies over a period of 5 years, while retaining an annual limit. The 
objective of the five-year dosimetry period dose limit is to optimize worker exposures over the 
duration of their full working life. This general concept has been widely adopted by many nuclear 
regulators, and most regulators set a 5-year dose limit as well as an annual dose limit. 
It is the licensee’s obligation to ensure that NEWs, persons who are not NEWs, and pregnant 
NEWs (who have informed the licensee of the pregnancy in writing) do not receive doses in 
excess of applicable effective dose limits in subsection 13(1) of the RPR. When determining an 
individual’s accrued dose for the purposes of comparing against the effective dose limits, 
previously assigned doses associated with exposure to ionizing radiation from activities not 
regulated under the NSCA and its regulations should also be taken into account by a licensee (as 
discussed in section 12). In addition, if a worker is a NEW, the licensee must also consider 
available dose information before the NEW commences the work for the licensee, in order to 
ensure the worker’s dose remains below effective dose limits. Licensees should obtain 
occupational dose information for NEWs who perform work at other facilities (such as contractor 
personnel) where they may have been exposed to ionizing radiation. 
The five-year dosimetry period has been defined as a fixed period of 5 calendar years, at the end 
of which a new period begins. A new five-year dosimetry period began on January 1, 2021, and 
will end on December 31, 2025. 
There is flexibility provided in subsection 13(2) of the RPR, which allows for situations in which 
the end of a dosimeter-wearing period or a bioassay sampling period does not coincide with the 
end of a dosimetry period. A licensee may extend or reduce a dosimetry period by 2 weeks in 
order to align with the dosimeter-wearing period or bioassay sampling period. For example, a 
dosimetry period ending on December 31 may end as early as December 17 if a reduction of up to 
2 weeks if necessary, or may be extended to January 14 of the following calendar year. 
More detailed information on the concept of effective dose, including ascertaining effective 
doses, may be found in REGDOC-2.7.2, Volume I [1]. 
14. 
Equivalent Dose Limits 
Equivalent dose limits are in place to avoid tissue reactions (previously referred to as 
deterministic (threshold) effects). Equivalent doses, or doses to specific tissues or organs, are 
distinguished from effective or whole-body doses in order to account for the particular sensitivity 
of certain organs and body parts to radiation. Separate dose limits are necessary to control 
radiation exposure to the lens of the eye, the skin, and the hands and feet in order to prevent tissue 
reactions and organ dysfunction. Tissue reactions only occur above a certain threshold dose and 
increase in severity with increased dose. They are distinguished from stochastic effects, which 
have no known dose thresholds and whose severity is independent of the magnitude of the dose. 
Section 14 of the RPR establishes the equivalent dose limits for NEWs and any other person (i.e., 
a person who is not a NEW). 
As required by subsection 14(1) of the RPR, every licensee must ensure that the equivalent dose 
received by and committed to an organ or tissue, as set out in column 1 of table 2, of a person 
described in column 2 for that organ or tissue, during the period set out in column 3 for that organ 
or tissue, does not exceed the equivalent dose set out in the corresponding column 4.

It is the licensee’s obligation to ensure that NEWs and any other persons do not exceed the 
applicable equivalent dose limits in subsection 14(1) of the RPR. When determining an 
individual’s accrued dose for the purposes of comparing against the equivalent dose limits, 
previously assigned doses associated with exposure to ionizing radiation from activities not 
regulated under the NSCA and its regulations should also be taken into account by a licensee (as 
discussed in section 12). In addition, for a worker is a NEW, the licensee must also consider 
available dose information before the NEW commences work for the licensee, in order to ensure 
that the worker’s dose remains below equivalent dose limits. Licensees should obtain dose 
information for NEWs who perform work (i.e., contractor personnel) at other facilities where they 
may be exposed to ionizing radiation. 
“Equivalent dose” means the product, in Sv, obtained by multiplying the absorbed dose by the 
weighting factor of a given type of radiation. 
When living matter absorbs radiation, the radiation can produce a biological effect. Since 
different types of ionizing radiation vary in how they interact with biological materials, absorbed 
doses of equal value do not necessarily have equal biological effects. For example, a given 
quantity of alpha radiation is more harmful to tissue than the same quantity of beta radiation. This 
is because an alpha particle is more heavily charged and deposits its energy much more densely 
along its path. 
A radiation weighting factor is used to equate different types of radiation with different levels of 
biological effectiveness. The concept of equivalent dose allows different types of ionizing 
radiation to be considered equally with respect to their potential to cause harm. 
As equivalent dose limits are set based on preventing tissue reactions, it is important to note that 
the equivalent dose limit for the hands and feet is for each individual hand and foot. Therefore, 
when assessing the dose to the left hand and the right hand, or to the left foot and the right foot, 
they are treated as separate entities, with separate equivalent dose limits.  
The ICRP recommends an equivalent dose limit for the lens of an eye for occupational exposures 
in planned situations of 20 mSv in a year, averaged over defined 5-year periods, with no single 
year exceeding 50 mSv. The recommendation is based on a threshold in absorbed dose for 
radiation-induced lens opacities, considered to be 0.5 Gy. The CNSC’s equivalent dose limit for 
NEWs is 50 mSv in a one-year dosimetry period. In order to manage NEWs’ doses to the lens of 
the eye, licensees must implement measures with the intent of keeping cumulative doses to the 
July 2021 
REGDOC-2.7.1, Radiation Protection 
 
33 
 
lens of the eye ALARA, through the setting of action and administrative levels (as described in 
section 6) and consideration of the use of dose constraints and other ALARA tools, as described 
in section 4.1.5. 
There is flexibility provided in subsection 14(2) of the RPR for situations in which the end of a 
dosimeter-wearing period does not coincide with the end of a dosimetry period for equivalent 
dose limits. For example, a dosimetry period ending on December 31 may end as early as 
December 17 if a reduction by up to 2 weeks is needed, or may be extended to as late as January 
14 of the following calendar year if an extension is needed. 
Subsection 14(3) of the RPR also specifies that when skin is unevenly irradiated, the equivalent 
dose received by the skin is the average equivalent dose over the 1-cm2 area that received the 
highest equivalent dose. 
More detailed information on the concept of equivalent dose, including ascertaining dose to the 
lens of the eye, the skin, and the hands and feet, may be found in REGDOC-2.7.2, Volume I [1]. 
15. 
Emergencies 
Section 15 of the RPR details regulatory requirements related to exposures of persons who form 
part of the licensee’s response organization during the control of an emergency. The dose limits 
specified in section 15 of the RPR are applied when the control of an unusual situation cannot be 
managed within the dose limits prescribed in sections 13 and 14 of the RPR. 
REGDOC-2.10.1, Nuclear Emergency Preparedness and Response [26], sets out the emergency 
preparedness requirements and guidance related to the development of emergency measures for 
licensees and licence applicants of Class I nuclear facilities and uranium mines and mills. 
An emergency preparedness program establishes how nuclear facilities prepare for and plan to 
respond to emergencies (including nuclear or radiological emergencies), in order to protect 
workers, the public and the environment. 
As part of the preparedness and response measures, licensees must establish an emergency 
response organization (ERO), which is defined as a group of inter-related responders who 
undertake the emergency response function during an emergency. Licensees should ensure that 
there is clarity on the roles and responsibilities and authorities of each position within the ERO. 
In addition, licensees must develop and document emergency radiation protection measures and 
provide training to individuals to ensure that they are qualified and able to fulfill their assigned 
emergency response role. Licensees’ responsibilities for providing information to NEWs 
regarding their responsibilities during an emergency, including the risks associated with radiation 
to which the worker may be exposed during the control of an emergency, are covered in more 
detail in section 7. Additional guidance on provision of radiation protection training for all other 
persons, such as emergency response personnel, is provided in A.7.  
The management of exposures of persons who are part of emergency response organizations 
under the authority of the local jurisdiction, the province or a federal entity is outside the scope of 
the requirements of section 15 of the RPR. Guidance values for restricting exposures of these 
emergency responders are addressed in Health Canada’s Generic Criteria and Operational 
Intervention Levels for Nuclear Emergency Planning and Response [27].

If it is deemed necessary to declare an emergency, which requires the application of the dose 
limits specified in section 15 of the RPR, it is important to note that the doses received during the 
control of the emergency situation are considered separate from doses received during normal 
planned exposure situations, as per subsection 15(1) of the RPR. 
As per subsection 15(2) of the RPR, for the purposes of the emergency, a licensee who requests a 
person to participate in the control of an emergency must ensure that the person does not receive 
an effective dose greater than 50 mSv or an equivalent dose to the skin greater than 500 mSv for 
the duration of their participation in the control of the emergency, unless that person is taking an 
emergency action described in column 1 of the table in subsection 15(3) of the RPR. 
 
Action item 1 (actions to minimize dose consequences for members of the public associated 
with the release of radioactive material) may include taking actions to establish emergency 
management and operations; identifying, notifying and activating; assessing the initial phase; 
assisting in the implementation of urgent protective actions; and managing the medical 
response. 
 
Action item 2 (actions to prevent health effects of radiation that are fatal or life-threatening, 
or that result in permanent injury) may involve, for example, action required by a person to 
remove an injured or unconscious fellow person from a very high-hazard area. 
 
Action item 3 (actions to prevent the development of conditions that could significantly affect 
people and the environment) may include mitigating actions taken by the operator or first 
responder. 
Subsection 15(4) requires that if, on the request of a licensee, a person takes emergency actions 
described in more than one item of the table to subsection 15(3) of the RPR, the licensee must 
ensure that the effective dose received by that person does not exceed 500 mSv and that the 
equivalent dose to the skin received by that person does not exceed 5,000 mSv. 
Further, subsection 15(5) of the RPR requires licensees to limit effective dose and equivalent 
dose received by and committed to all persons participating in the control of an emergency by 
applying the ALARA principle, taking into account social and economic factors. Planning for 
such actions should be done as part of emergency preparedness and response as outlined in 
REGDOC-2.10.1, Nuclear Emergency Preparedness and Response, [26]. 
Subsection 15(6) of the RPR requires licensees to notify the person who received a dose of 
radiation, and the Commission as soon as feasible, in the event that the licensee becomes aware 
that any of the dose limits prescribed in section 15 of the RPR may have been exceeded. This 
notification process should occur in a timely manner to ensure that necessary actions can be 
initiated to restrict further exposure of the individual in order to minimize any radiation-related 
health effects. 
As per subsection 15(7) of the RPR, licensees must not request a pregnant woman to participate 
in the direct control of an emergency. This restriction extends to all pregnant women who have 
informed the licensee, in writing, that they are pregnant, and who may be involved in the control 
of an emergency, including emergency response personnel and other workers (including those 
employed by the licensee) who provide assistance during an emergency. As described in sections 
7 and A.7, risk information to NEWs and emergency response personnel should include the risks 
associated with the exposure of embryos and fetuses to radiation, and the importance of females 
informing the licensee, in writing, if they are pregnant. The CNSC acknowledges that a pregnant 
worker may play an active role in aiding emergency response activities, but must not be subject to 
the dose limits prescribed in section 15 of the RPR because of the potential risks to the 
July 2021 
REGDOC-2.7.1, Radiation Protection 
 
35 
 
developing embryo or fetus. It is possible for a pregnant worker to contribute to the emergency 
response, but only from a radiologically stable and safe location where she would continue to be 
subject to the dose limits prescribed in sections 13 and 14 of the RPR.  
A female who is breastfeeding an infant is not exempt from participating in the control of an 
emergency. However, if the licensee has been informed that a female is breastfeeding an infant, 
measures should be taken to ensure the protection of the breastfed infant. If there are internal 
radiological hazards that the female may be exposed to as a result of the emergency response 
activities, the licensee should take action to limit her intakes of nuclear substances. Measures may 
include assignment of tasks that do not have the potential for internal exposures. When this is not 
possible, the licensee should provide protective equipment to limit intakes of nuclear substances 
by the female. Cessation of breastfeeding for a period of time may be required, if the protective 
measures are not effective in limiting the potential exposure to the breastfed infant. 
The dose limits prescribed by subsections 15(2) and (3), and sections 13 and 14 of the RPR, may 
be exceeded by a person acting voluntarily to save or protect human life, as per subsection 15(8) 
of the RPR. 
Once the emergency is terminated, occupational exposures continue to be managed under the 
requirements of the licensee’s radiation protection program and the dose limits prescribed in 
sections 13 and 14 of the RPR. As a general principle, a person should not be prevented from 
returning to future planned work because of doses received during an emergency. However, a 
case-by-case consideration for return to work may be required, and should take into account the 
magnitude of the doses received and any relevant medical advice, and may entail certain 
conditions as specified by the Commission. 
16. 
Exceedance of a Regulatory Dose Limit 
Section 16 of the RPR specifies the actions that licensees must take upon becoming aware that an 
applicable dose limit as prescribed by section 13 or 14 of the RPR has been exceeded. 
A person who may have received an exposure in excess of a dose limit for a NEW must not 
perform work involving possible radiation exposure that would add to the dose in order to: 
 
 
allow for the investigation to be completed 
 
avoid further exposures that could cause a risk to the individual 
The licensee cannot permit the person to return to their duties with the potential for occupational 
radiation exposure until the Commission or a designated officer authorized under 
paragraph 37(2)(h) of the NSCA formally authorizes the return to work pursuant to section 17 of 
the RPR. Additional information on the authorization of the return to work of a person is found in 
section 17. 
 
Paragraph 48(h) of the NSCA makes it an offence to terminate or vary the conditions of 
employment of a NEW who has received, or is committed to, a dose of radiation in excess of the 
regulatory limits, except in the prescribed manner and circumstances. When a dose limit is 
exceeded, it may be accidental or it may be the result of some faulty practice on the part of the 
licensee or the NEW. When the investigation reveals that the cause was accidental or the licensee 
was responsible, the NEW should not be subject to unjust economic penalties (i.e., terminated or 
placed on leave without compensation). When the investigation concludes that the cause was the 
July 2021 
REGDOC-2.7.1, Radiation Protection 
 
36 
 
result of a faulty practice of the NEW, the licensee should identify corrective actions that will 
address any human performance issues that the NEW may have before considering disciplinary 
action. 
It is important to note that the requirement to remove the person from work only applies to 
situations in which the person may have exceeded a dose limit for a NEW. 
When a dose limit has been exceeded, licensees must conduct an investigation to determine the 
magnitude of the dose and to establish the causes of the overexposure. The investigation into the 
magnitude of the dose will vary depending on the nature of the exposure – external, internal, skin 
contamination, and so on – and whether a CNSC-licensed dosimetry service was used at the time 
of the event to ascertain the dose. If a licensed dosimetry service was not in use, a dose 
reconstruction will be necessary as part of the investigation into the magnitude of the dose. 
If a dose reconstruction is required to determine the amount of radiation exposure due to a 
radiation source outside the person’s body or due to skin contaminations, licensees should refer to  
REGDOC-2.7.2, Volume I [1] for guidance. 
When investigating an internal dose resulting from a nuclear substance taken into the person’s 
body, licensees should refer to REGDOC-2.7.2, Volume I for guidance in collecting and handling 
radiobioassay samples, determining monitoring frequencies and other procedures to verify the 
magnitude of the dose. 
Corrective actions may be required as a result of the investigation into the event. If the dose limit 
was exceeded, the objective is to identify and apply corrective actions that will prevent a 
reoccurrence to the same or a different person. Remedial measures may include identifying and 
correcting physical deficiencies in the workplace, revising procedures and retraining workers. If 
the investigation determines that the dose limit was not exceeded, and the CNSC agrees with this 
conclusion, the cause(s) of the event should be investigated and corrective actions proposed to 
address causes such as an inappropriate dosimeter storage location, inadequate worker training, 
improper dosimeter handling or human error. 
The actions to be completed must be formally documented by the licensee and available for 
review by the Commission. 
17. 
Authorization of Return to Work 
Once the investigation required by section 16 of the RPR is complete, the cause of the real or 
apparent dose limit exceedance has been investigated, and corrective actions have been 
implemented by the licensee to the satisfaction of the CNSC, the licensee must submit a written 
request to the CNSC for authorization of the return to work of a person, as per section 17 of the 
RPR. 
This written request should include a declaration that the person involved has been informed of 
the results of the investigation and, if a dose limit has been exceeded, of the risks associated with 
the exposure itself and with returning to work. The Commission or a designated officer 
authorized by the Commission will then consider authorizing the return to work of a person. 
When the Commission, or a designated officer, authorizes the return to work of a person, the 
authorization may specify conditions to protect the health and safety of the person. Before a 
July 2021 
REGDOC-2.7.1, Radiation Protection 
 
37 
 
person is authorized to return to work, they may be subject to conditions, including but not 
limited to: 
 
prorated dose limits for the remainder of the one-year and/or five-year dosimetry period 
 
additional training requirements for workers 
 
requirements for the licensee to modify work practices and/or possibly the method of dose 
control 
If the investigation reveals that an official dose record, which has been filed with the NDR, 
requires a change, the authorization of the return to work of a person will include a request that 
the dose change request be filed by a specified date. Further information on the requirements for 
making changes to dose-related information filed with the NDR may be found in REGDOC-2.7.2, 
Volume I [1]. 
18. 
Application for a Licence To Operate a Dosimetry Service 
Section 18 of the RPR lists the information that will form the basis for granting a CNSC licence 
to operate a dosimetry service. Licensees who operate their own dosimetry services require a 
separate licence. A licensed dosimetry service will also need a nuclear substance licence for any 
radioactive sources it may possess. 
Full details of the criteria for granting a dosimetry service licence can be found in 
REGDOC-2.7.2, Volume II [2]. 
19. 
Obligations of Licensees 
Section 19 of the RPR lists the data that a CNSC-licensed dosimetry service operator is obliged to 
submit to the NDR for the purpose of uniquely identifying each NEW for whom a dose of 
radiation has been measured and monitored. The service operator should ensure the privacy of all 
personal information. Further information on this topic can be found in REGDOC-2.7.2, 
Volume II [2]. 
20. 
Labelling of Containers and Devices 
Section 20 of the RPR outlines the requirements for the labelling of containers and devices 
containing nuclear substances in order to alert persons to the presence of a nuclear substance and 
the existing or potential radiological hazard. The labelling is important because it alerts persons to 
the contents of the container or device, and by extension, to the associated radiation risk. 
Licensees should define, in their radiation protection programs, how all of the requirements of 
section 20 of the RPR are implemented. This includes situations where labelling requirements do 
not apply, as per subsection 20(2), and provisions for managing containers temporarily holding 
nuclear substances, as per subsection 20(3). 
Containers or devices that contain a nuclear substance must be labelled with the radiation warning 
symbol and the words “RAYONNEMENT – DANGER – RADIATION”. The radiation warning 
symbol and the words should be directly adjacent to one another. The radiation warning symbol, 
as set out in Schedule 3 of the RPR, must be displayed as further described in section 22. The 
July 2021 
REGDOC-2.7.1, Radiation Protection 
 
38 
 
following information included on the label is considered to satisfy the requirements of the RPR; 
any alternative approaches should be discussed with the CNSC: 
 
The name of the nuclear substance should be reported in standard nuclear notation 
(i.e., carbon-14, C-14, 14C). If there is more than one nuclear substance present, either each 
nuclear substance should be identified, or the primary nuclear substance(s) should be 
identified. Alternatively, the primary group of nuclear substances should be identified, where 
a group may be denoted as, for example, mixed fission and activation products, transuranics, 
natural uranium, depleted uranium, or enriched uranium. 
 
Quantity should be in units of measure, such as activity; e.g., Becquerel (Bq) or activity 
concentration (Bq/g), mass (g) or a mass concentration (ppm).  
 
Date of measurement is the date upon which the quantity measurement was made. 
 
Form is the chemical or physical form of the nuclear substance (solid, liquid or gas, special 
form, etc.). 
Labelling requirements do not apply if a container or device meets one or more of the following 
criteria. Situations where labelling requirements would not apply should be discussed with the 
CNSC: 
 
It is an essential component of the operation of the nuclear facility at which it is located: 
An example of an essential component is a vessel, hopper, tank, pump or pipe that contains a 
nuclear substance as part of the operation of a nuclear facility. 
 
It is used to hold nuclear substances for current or immediate use and is under the 
continuous direct observation of the licensee: This particular exemption allows for that 
type of use of a container or device that is holding a nuclear substance without the burden of 
having to label it. This exemption should be applied in situations where there is continuous 
control of the container or device by a trained worker. 
 
The quantity of nuclear substances is less than or equal to the exemption quantity: 
Containers and devices containing nuclear substances in quantities below the exemption 
quantities dictated in Schedule 1 of the Nuclear Substances and Radiation Devices 
Regulations are exempt from labelling requirements. 
 
It is used exclusively for transporting nuclear substances and labelled in accordance 
with the Packaging and Transport of Nuclear Substances Regulations, 2015: If the 
container or device is used exclusively for transporting nuclear substances, it must be labelled 
in a manner specified in the Packaging and Transport of Nuclear Substances Regulations, 
2015.  
 
The device is a radium luminous device, provided that a radium luminous compound is 
the only nuclear substance in the device and the device is intact and not tampered with: 
Devices that only contain a radium luminous compound, and are intact and not damaged, are 
exempt from labelling requirements. 
Subsection 20(3) of the RPR applies to containers that are used to temporarily hold nuclear 
substances. For example, containers used for collecting waste where contents may be changing as 
it is used. Another example is a container holding contaminated items removed from service 
awaiting reuse or decontamination. Such containers would only need to be labelled with the 
radiation warning symbol (trefoil) and the words “RAYONNEMENT – DANGER – 
RADIATION” to alert workers to the potential radiological hazards of the contents. All labelling 
requirements – including the name, quantity, date of measurement, and form of the nuclear 
substances in the container – would apply in full once the container is no longer being used to 
temporarily hold the nuclear substances. In this context, “temporarily” refers to the duration of 
July 2021 
REGDOC-2.7.1, Radiation Protection 
 
39 
 
use of the container used to hold nuclear substances, relative to the activities related to the use of 
the container. Such containers may be used beyond current or immediate use, and may not always 
be under the continuous direct observation of the licensee. It is understood that when the 
container used to temporarily hold nuclear substances is either full or no longer required, the 
contents are characterized so that all requirements of subsection 20(1) of the RPR may be met.  
21. 
Posting of Signs at Boundaries and Points of Access 
Every licensee is required by section 21 of the RPR to post and keep posted, at the boundary of 
and at every point of access to an area, room, vehicle or enclosure, a durable and legible sign that 
bears the radiation warning symbol set out in Schedule 3 (as described in section 22) and the 
words “RAYONNEMENT – DANGER – RADIATION”, if there is a nuclear substance in a 
quantity greater than 100 times its exemption quantity in the area, room, vehicle or enclosure, or 
if there is a reasonable probability that a person in the area, room, vehicle or enclosure will be 
exposed to an effective dose rate greater than 25 µSv/h. 
The words “RAYONNEMENT – DANGER – RADIATION” must be complete and must appear 
as indicated in the RPR. 
Exemption quantities are specified in Schedule 1 of the Nuclear Substances and Radiation 
Devices Regulations. 
Where areas, rooms or enclosures within a building are used to store or handle nuclear 
substances, signs should be prominently displayed on all access points/doors to these areas, 
rooms or enclosures, or alternatively, where they are visible immediately upon entry to the area, 
room or enclosure. 
The interpretation of “dose rate greater than 25 µSv/h” should be that of effective dose rate, and 
should therefore exclude dose rate measurements made on contact with sources of radiation 
inside an area, room, vehicle or enclosure. The effective dose rate can be ascertained either by 
direct measurement or by estimation. If a direct measurement is taken, it should be at a working 
distance (no less than 30 cm) from the source of radiation, using a calibrated radiation survey 
meter, in any accessible space inside an area, room, vehicle or enclosure. In this instance, the 
operational quantity H*10 (used for the calibration of radiation survey meters) is used as a 
surrogate for effective dose rate. If the dose rate is ascertained by estimation, published effective 
dose rate constants, such as those found in the CNSC’s Radionuclide Information Booklet [28], 
should be used to calculate dose rates at working distances no smaller than 30 cm from the source 
of radiation in any accessible space inside the area, room, vehicle or enclosure. 
Vehicles containing a consignment as defined by the Packaging and Transport of Nuclear 
Substance Regulations, 2015 are exempt from the posting requirements dictated in section 21 of 
the RPR. However, if a vehicle is not in transit4 but is used to store a nuclear substance, the 
regulatory requirement applies if the conditions stipulated for posting of signs exist. 
                                                     
 
 
4 As defined in the Packaging and Transport of Nuclear Substances Regulations, 2015, “transit” means the process 
of being transported through Canada after being imported into and before being exported from Canada, in a situation 
where the place of initial loading and the final destination are outside Canada.

22. 
Use of the Radiation Warning Symbol 
Section 22 of the RPR requires the radiation warning symbol as set out in Schedule 3 of the RPR 
to be displayed. The 3 blades and the central disk of the symbol must be magenta or black, and 
located on a yellow background. When the radiation warning symbol (trefoil) set out in Schedule 
3 is used, the RPR require that it be fully visible, of a size appropriate for the size of the container 
or device to which it is affixed or attached, or the area, room or enclosure in respect of which it is 
posted, in the proportions depicted in Schedule 3, and oriented with one blade pointed downward 
and centred on the vertical axis. There must be no wording superimposed on it. 
23. 
Frivolous Posting 
Section 23 of the RPR requires that no person post or keep posted a sign that indicates the 
presence of radiation, a nuclear substance or prescribed equipment at a place where the radiation, 
nuclear substance or prescribed equipment indicated on the sign is not present. 
Signs must be removed when the radiological hazard is no longer present. However, it is not 
considered frivolous to post signs where there is a potential for contamination or radiation 
exposure (e.g., signs posted in areas in the proximity of X-ray facilities).  
24. 
Records To Be Kept by Licensees 
As per section 24 of the RPR, every licensee must retain certain records in order to meet 
regulatory requirements. They include the name and job category of each NEW (collected as per 
subsection 8(2) and section 10 of the RPR), and records of doses received by persons who 
perform duties in connection with any activity that is authorized by the NSCA or who are present 
at a place where that activity is carried on. 
Licensees must ensure that the records are accurate and maintained. Dose records must be 
retained for a period of 5 years after the date that the information was collected. This retention 
period allows for the management and control of doses to persons in accordance with regulatory 
requirements, including NEWs, over the one-year and five-year dosimetry periods. This retention 
period also takes into consideration that doses to NEWs who use a licensed dosimetry service are 
also stored in the NDR. This registry is the most appropriate database for the retention of 
cumulative occupational dose records for future use (i.e., epidemiological studies, litigation). 
In addition to meeting regulatory requirements, the maintenance and retention of dose records 
enables the licensee to evaluate the effectiveness of the radiation protection program and the 
effectiveness of the optimization process, and also enables them to identify trends in exposure. 
Further, the licensee can use this information to develop and improve upon their monitoring 
procedures and programs. 
25. 
Radiation Detection and Measurement Instrumentation 
Licensees are required by section 25 of the RPR to ensure that instruments and equipment used 
for radiation measurements are appropriately selected, tested and calibrated for their intended use. 
Selection, testing and calibration processes for all instruments and equipment must be 
documented within CNSC licensees’ radiation protection programs, as applicable. 
July 2021 
REGDOC-2.7.1, Radiation Protection 
 
41 
 
Radiation measurements are essential in order to assess, verify or demonstrate the credibility and 
effectiveness of a radiation protection program. For the purposes of section 25 of the RPR, a 
radiation measurement is a measurement of dose, dose rate or activity for reasons related to the 
assessment or control of exposure to persons from radiation or nuclear substances, and the 
interpretation of the results. Sampling may be involved as a preliminary step to a radiation 
measurement. Radiation measurements may be made of radiation levels, airborne activity 
concentrations, levels of contamination, quantities of nuclear substances, or individual doses 
(typically a measurement of a dose equivalent quantity as proxy (i.e., substitute) for a dose 
quantity that cannot be measured directly). The results of these radiation measurements may be 
used to assess radiological hazards or doses resulting or potentially resulting from exposure. 
Instruments and equipment used for radiation measurements include those that are fixed and 
portable, automated or manual, multi-purpose or single purpose. For example, fixed and portable 
radiation survey meters may be used to perform radiation measurements to assess or confirm 
radiation fields at different locations or over large areas. Both fixed and portable contamination 
detection instruments may be needed to detect or assess radioactive contamination of equipment, 
premises or persons. As well, DRDs (both active [electronic] and passive) and air 
monitoring/sampling equipment may be used for radiation measurements in order to measure, 
estimate or control radiological exposures. 
25.1 
Selection of instruments and equipment used for radiation measurements 
The RPR require that instruments and equipment used for radiation measurements be selected 
appropriately to ensure that a radiation measurement can be made. The quantities and types of 
instruments and equipment used for radiation measurements in a specific situation will depend on 
such factors as the type, forms, location, magnitude and extent of the type(s) of radiation. The 
quantities and types of instruments and equipment available should be adequate for anticipated 
needs in normal operations and emergencies, as well as during calibration, maintenance and 
repairs. Defective or out-of-tolerance instruments should be identified and properly labelled, and 
corrective measures taken in a timely manner.  
The conditions of use are also a factor in the selection of instruments and equipment. If radiation 
measurements are to be made in extreme environmental conditions (such as extreme cold or 
warm temperatures, high humidity, or areas with vibrations), the manufacturer’s manual should 
be consulted to confirm that the instrument or equipment will function in such environments 
(within the range of normal/optimal operating conditions). Some radiation survey meters and 
electronic DRDs may also over- or under-respond in high radiation fields. Licensees should 
consult qualified experts as appropriate for advice in the selection of the instruments and 
equipment. 
Appendix C.13 provides additional guidance on selection and functionality of instruments and 
equipment used for contamination monitoring. Contamination monitoring instruments and 
equipment must be appropriate for the types, levels and energies of the radiation and nuclear 
substance(s) encountered. A suitable instrument/equipment for contamination monitoring should 
be available wherever unsealed nuclear substances such as liquids and powders are in use. 
However, care should be taken to avoid the instrument coming into contact with potentially 
contaminated surfaces.  
July 2021 
REGDOC-2.7.1, Radiation Protection 
 
42 
 
25.2 
Testing of instruments and equipment used for radiation measurements  
The RPR require that instruments and equipment used for radiation measurements be tested in 
order to assure persons that the unit is functioning properly. Testing is the performance of 
measurements and other operational checks to confirm that an instrument is functioning correctly. 
All instruments and equipment must be routinely tested, which can include physical inspections, 
battery check, high-voltage check, alarm (audible and visual) tests, a radiation source response 
check, and a background radiation measurement. Instruments and equipment that are not 
operating within the parameters of the tests, or that show anomalous background or radiation 
source measurements, should not be used until their proper operation can be verified. These 
should be tagged indicating that they are out of service and should not be used until their proper 
operation has been verified. 
25.3 
Calibration of instruments and equipment used for radiation measurements 
The RPR require that instruments and equipment used for radiation measurements must be 
calibrated in order to assure persons that the readings obtained are representative of the actual 
conditions. A calibration is a process conducted under specified conditions that establish the 
relationship between values indicated by a measuring instrument, and the conventionally true 
values of the quantity or variable being measured or compared against. Actions associated with 
the calibration of instruments and equipment used for radiation measurements include the 
following: 
 
For radiation survey meters and DRDs, making adjustments of observed measurements in a 
known radiation field to within ± 20% of the conventionally true dose rate  
 
For contamination monitoring instruments and equipment, determination of the detector 
efficiency and response relative to a known radiation source 
 
For rotameters and flow meters, determination of response and making adjustments against 
conventionally true values associated with devices that are traceable to a national or 
international standards laboratory  
 
For air monitoring instruments, determination of efficiency and response using radioactive 
sources exhibiting the radiation type and energies of the airborne radioactivity to be 
monitored 
 
For equipment and instruments used for thyroid screening, determination of the detector 
efficiency for the radioiodine of interest  
Appendix C.8 provides a calibration process (i.e., determination of detector efficiency and 
response) for instruments and equipment used for demonstrating compliance to contamination 
control limits specified in a CNSC licence or documented in a CNSC licensee’s radiation 
protection program, as applicable.  
Appendix D provides an example calibration process for radiation survey meters and DRDs that 
are used to make radiation measurements that are directly compared against a regulatory criterion 
and/or limit. Examples include radiation measurements for confirming posting requirements 
dictated by paragraph 21(1)(b) of the RPR, or when DRDs are used as primary dosimetry for 
workers. Additional regulatory requirements for the availability of calibrated radiation survey 
meters are specified in section 20 of the Nuclear Substances and Radiation Devices Regulations 
and in subsection 18(1) of the Class II Nuclear Facilities and Prescribed Equipment Regulations. 
Subparagraphs 30(3)(d)(iii) and (e)(iv) of the Nuclear Substances and Radiation Devices 
July 2021 
REGDOC-2.7.1, Radiation Protection 
 
43 
 
Regulations specify additional requirements for the calibration of DRDs used by certified 
exposure device operators.  
A similar approach should be taken by licensees when calibrating radiation instruments and 
equipment as per the example calibration process in Appendix D. 
Instruments and equipment must be calibrated before the very first use, at regular intervals (at a 
minimum annually), and after any repair that may have affected the instrument’s performance. 
A record of calibration must be maintained, and calibrated instruments and equipment should be 
clearly and indelibly identified (e.g., through the use of labels).

Appendix A: Guidance on the Provision of Radiation Protection Training 
by Work Group 
A.1 
Management 
Licensees (or their managers, in larger organizations) have the ultimate responsibility for ensuring worker 
safety. They should therefore have a good understanding of the NSCA and of any other legislation and 
regulations relevant to their licensed activities. They should also know the principles of radiation 
protection and safety culture, and understand their responsibility for managing radiological risks by 
implementing the ALARA principle. 
Senior management should be trained in the risks associated with radiation, the basic principles of 
protection and safety, their main responsibilities regarding radiological risk management, and the 
principal elements of the radiation protection program. 
A.2 
Radiation protection personnel 
Radiation protection personnel are responsible for ensuring the radiation protection of workers, and may 
be assisted by technical personnel responsible for performing specific tasks. All licensees, regardless of 
their size, will have someone responsible for radiation protection, licensing and compliance matters. 
These individuals should understand the NSCA, the applicable regulations made pursuant to the NSCA, 
and the conditions of the licence under which their activities are being carried out. Radiation protection 
personnel should also be well informed about the current radiation protection principles, methods and 
practices related to the licensed activity. 
Training for radiation protection personnel should cover at least all topics associated with radiation 
protection at the level of detail required by their responsibility in ensuring the day-to-day safety of 
workers and of the public. Radiation protection personnel should also be trained in methods and 
techniques for controlling, using, handling, storing and disposing of nuclear substances and prescribed 
equipment, and for controlling, using or operating the applicable radiation devices and prescribed 
equipment. Training should cover the methods and techniques for monitoring radioactive contamination 
and supervising decontamination work, and for monitoring and controlling the radiation dose rates and 
radiation exposure of all workers. 
A.3 
Nuclear energy workers 
NEWs are defined in the NSCA as persons having a reasonable probability of exceeding the annual 
regulatory effective dose limit of 1 mSv for a member of the public due to the nature of their work 
activities in connection to a CNSC-licensed activity or facility. In practical terms, NEWs are individuals 
who routinely use nuclear substances or operate radiation devices or prescribed equipment. As such, they 
are occupationally exposed to radiation and are closely monitored for the radiation dose they may receive. 
NEWs generally require more extensive and specialized radiation protection training than workers who 
may only occasionally be exposed to radiation. The training objectives for these workers and the level of 
detail with which each topic should be covered depend on the licensed activity, the radiological hazards to 
which they may be exposed, the nature of their jobs and the associated tasks and responsibilities, and the 
difficulty, importance and frequency of those tasks. For example, workers operating an irradiation facility 
or involved in radiation therapy, whose duties involve the continuous use of nuclear substances or 
July 2021 
REGDOC-2.7.1, Radiation Protection 
 
45 
 
prescribed equipment, would likely need more extensive training than those who work in the vicinity of 
fixed nuclear gauges. 
Where appropriate and safe, training for NEWs should include practical exercises and on-the-job-training. 
In some cases, NEWs should work under supervision for a period of time after training is completed, until 
they have acquired sufficient experience and self-confidence to independently perform their jobs safely 
and competently. 
A.4 
General employees 
This group includes workers whose duties do not typically involve the direct use of nuclear substances, 
prescribed equipment or radiation devices, but who may occasionally go into areas where they could be 
exposed to radiation. Whether or not a worker can be classified as a general employee depends on several 
factors, including the frequency with which they may be required to enter areas where radiological 
hazards exist, the duration of their stay in those areas, the magnitude of potential exposure, and the level 
of supervision. 
This group typically includes cleaning and maintenance staff; storage, shipping and receiving personnel; 
and administrative staff; and may include some categories of nurses, visitors and students. These workers 
should be provided with radiation awareness training that addresses the radiological hazards present in the 
workplace, the level of exposure they may receive, basic protective measures against radiation, and how 
to recognize radiation warning signs and symbols. 
A.5 
Contractor personnel 
Some licensees outsource specific work to an outside contractor. Contractor personnel may include 
general labourers, technicians, consultants, and maintenance and security personnel. In all cases, radiation 
protection training for contractor personnel should be similar to that required by full-time personnel 
performing identical tasks, and should be commensurate with the radiological hazards to which they may 
be exposed. Previous training can be identified from the contractor personnel’s documented experience 
and assessed through training program entry testing. If previous training is inadequate, the licensee should 
ensure that contractor personnel receive additional training appropriate to their duties, or should arrange 
for them to be directly supervised by suitably trained workers. 
Some contractors may provide services that require them to be defined as NEWs, and therefore guidance 
for provision of training for nuclear energy workers should be referred to. 
A.6 
Visitors 
Individuals entering a licensed facility for brief periods of time, such as members of a visiting group, 
personnel of a delivery firm or messengers, are usually accompanied by an escort and normally should 
not need any radiation protection training. They should, however, be informed of the radiological hazards 
in the facility. For institutions such as hospitals and universities, where members of the public routinely 
have unescorted access, licensees should ensure that visitors entering controlled areas, such as nuclear 
medicine departments or laboratories using nuclear substances, are informed of any mandatory safety 
requirements. 
Other individuals visiting a facility for longer periods than those described above, such as scientists and 
students, should undergo appropriate training similar to what is discussed in A.5. 
July 2021 
REGDOC-2.7.1, Radiation Protection 
 
46 
 
A.7 
Emergency response personnel 
Emergency situations may occur at any licensed facility, and the potential radiological risk to workers, the 
public and the environment in emergency situations is directly proportional to the nature of the 
radiological hazards present. 
During an emergency, there may be a need for intervention by specialized personnel other than the 
licensee’s workers, such as firefighters, police and medical personnel. In some situations, emergency 
response personnel from outside organizations may not have received radiation protection training. 
To ensure adequate preparedness of all parties, the CNSC recommends that the licensee liaise with 
emergency response personnel to coordinate the response capability and to provide information pertaining 
to provincial, territorial and federal health and safety regulations associated with the facility or the 
activities carried out therein. Emergency response personnel should be informed about the hazards they 
may encounter and the associated risks, including the risks associated with the exposure of embryos and 
fetuses to radiation, and the importance for females to inform the licensee, in writing, if they are pregnant. 
In the event of an emergency, emergency response personnel should be accompanied and closely 
supervised by the licensee’s radiation protection personnel while carrying out their response duties.  
Further information on the provision of information to NEWs regarding their duties and responsibilities 
during an emergency is discussed in section 7. 
Additional guidance on emergency preparedness and response at nuclear facilities may be found in 
REGDOC-2.10.1, Nuclear Emergency Preparedness and Response [26].

Appendix B: Guidance on Workplace Monitoring Programs 
B.1 
Contamination control  
Work with unsealed nuclear substances creates the potential for contamination of surfaces and persons. A 
contamination control program should be implemented as part of the radiation protection program to 
identify surface contamination and prevent the inadvertent transfer of such contamination. 
In implementing a contamination control program, physical design features for controlling surface 
contamination at source is very important. The physical design features used in a contamination control 
program may include: 
 
specific design features aimed at containment of the nuclear substance to prevent it from causing 
surface contamination in the first place 
 
ventilation systems aimed at preventing the buildup of surface contamination as a result of the settling 
of airborne particles 
Guidance on monitoring for radioactive contamination is provided in appendix C. Additional information 
about the selection, testing and calibration of instruments and equipment is found in section 25. 
Particularly during non-routine work such as equipment maintenance, design features may be the primary 
methods of controlling workers’ internal exposures from inhalation of radionuclides in airborne particles. 
When the use of physical design features (including specific engineered controls) to restrict individual 
exposures is impractical or not sufficiently effective, administrative controls should be implemented. 
Such administrative controls might include restrictions on access to a contaminated area or the use of 
specific work practices designed to minimize contamination transfer. 
Work in contaminated areas should be conducted in a manner that minimizes the spread of contamination 
to adjacent surfaces, to individuals in the area and to the workplace atmosphere. To control the spread of 
contamination and restrict individual exposures, a graded, multiple-tier system, such as a physical barrier 
or cordoning of the affected areas, should be used in and around contaminated areas. 
Control of access to contaminated areas may be necessary to ensure that workers entering the area are 
informed of the radiological status and potential hazards and, if necessary, are provided with the 
appropriate protective equipment. Visual display of the levels of contamination and caution boards should 
be prominently displayed. Control of the workers’ exit from contaminated areas ensures that nuclear 
substances are not inadvertently removed from the area by personnel or equipment. Efforts should be 
made to limit the degree of contamination and the size and number of contaminated areas within a 
facility. 
Personnel contamination monitoring should be performed to keep radiation exposures ALARA. Personnel 
leaving contaminated areas should use appropriate radiation monitoring equipment to monitor their hands, 
feet and other areas suspected of being contaminated. Adequate decontamination facilities should be 
made available. To minimize the spread of contamination, licensees should provide washing facilities for 
all workers, and should allow sufficient time for each worker to use washing facilities before breaks and 
at the end of shifts. Exits from contaminated areas should include provisions to facilitate retention of 
contamination in the area and provisions for monitoring of individuals and the area to ensure control has 
been maintained. Any personal items carried into the area should be monitored for surface contamination. 
July 2021 
REGDOC-2.7.1, Radiation Protection 
 
48 
 
No person should eat, drink, chew or smoke in working areas where nuclear substances could be ingested. 
Licensees should provide ‒ at locations that are reasonably accessible to every worker ‒ clean eating areas 
that are supplied with water, good-quality air and handwashing facilities to prevent the intake of nuclear 
substances. 
B.1.1 
Contamination control limits 
Contamination control limits should be established in all areas/locations at a nuclear facility or site of a 
licensed activity where unsealed nuclear substances are handled, used or stored. Areas/locations should 
include clean areas (such as eating areas) as well as areas where work with nuclear substances or 
prescribed equipment is conducted. These areas should be monitored at regular intervals to ensure that the 
contamination present is below the established contamination control limits. Additional guidance on 
classification of areas and access control is discussed in section 4.4.1.  
Contamination control limits for each area or zone should be established based on the principles of 
isolating contamination at the source and maintaining levels of contamination ALARA. The 
contamination control limits for each area should be determined in consideration of the work activities to 
be conducted in the area, expected levels of contamination resulting from the activities, and PPE that is 
appropriate for use in the area. Areas with the highest contamination control limits should always be 
separated from the public domain by transitioning areas/zones with lower allowable limits. It is best 
practice to have a zero-tolerance policy for any detectable loose contamination; it should be cleaned up 
immediately upon detection.  
Certain CNSC licences authorizing the use of unsealed nuclear substances contain a condition that states 
the regulatory criteria pertaining to radioactive contamination. Other types of licences do not contain any 
conditions directly pertaining to surface contamination control limits. In these cases, appropriate criteria 
must be established and licensees should be prepared to provide justification for the values chosen. 
Criteria in the American National Standards Institute/Health Physics Society (ANSI/HPS) N13.12-2013, 
Surface and Volume Radioactivity Standards for Clearance [29], may be used as guidance as it includes 
surface contamination criteria conservatively derived based on an annual dose of 10 µSv to the most 
exposed person. 
B.1.2 
Decontamination of personnel and equipment 
Licensees should provide, as necessary, a dedicated area and decontamination agents for the 
decontamination of equipment and contaminated tools, and the means for cleaning contaminated areas of 
floors and walls. Cleaning agents should be selected based upon their effectiveness, hazardous properties, 
amount of waste generated, compatibility with the contaminated surface and other systems or items that 
may be contaminated (including protective clothing and waste handling systems), and ease of disposal. 
Adequate decontamination facilities should also be made available if personnel contamination is detected. 
When skin or personal clothing contamination is detected, the responsible radiation protection personnel 
should be informed in order to ensure adequate characterization of the potential for significant skin dose 
by assessing the extent of the contamination, retaining samples of the contamination as necessary to 
perform a detailed dose assessment, and initiating decontamination procedures. Levels of contamination 
that trigger the need for dose assessments should be established for site-specific radionuclides; additional 
guidance may be found in REGDOC-2.7.2, Volume I [1]. Skin decontamination methods should be 
established for site-specific radionuclides. 
July 2021 
REGDOC-2.7.1, Radiation Protection 
 
49 
 
Contaminated personal clothing should be decontaminated by laundering or other appropriate methods 
(such as holding for decay in the case of short-lived nuclear substances), monitored and returned to the 
owner or, if necessary, disposed of as radioactive waste. 
Medical treatment of injuries takes precedence over radiological considerations. Emergency medical care 
should be administered immediately for injuries involving nuclear substances. The use of universal 
precautions (e.g., gloves, face mask) is generally sufficient for protecting medical personnel from any 
contamination transferred from the patient. Decontamination efforts should start immediately thereafter to 
minimize the potential uptake of soluble nuclear substances, which could lead to a radiation dose to the 
individual. 
B.2 
Radiation dose rate monitoring and control 
The workplace monitoring program should include frequent radiation dose rate surveys to ensure 
radiation exposures are kept ALARA, commensurate with the radiological hazards present. Radiation 
dose rate surveys should be performed by qualified and trained individuals with appropriate and properly 
functioning and calibrated radiation detection instrumentation. 
The radiation protection program should include a radiation dose rate monitoring and survey program that 
includes provisions for the following: 
 
routine monitoring (conducted to demonstrate that the working environment is satisfactory for 
continued operations and that no change has taken place that would call for a reassessment of 
operational procedures) 
 
task-related monitoring (to supply information about a particular task or operation and to provide, if 
necessary, a basis for immediate decisions on the execution of the task) 
 
special monitoring (such as during the commissioning stage for new facilities, following major 
modifications to either facilities or procedures, or when operations are being carried out under 
abnormal circumstances such as those following an incident or an accident) 
 
The description of the methods for monitoring and performing surveys, as well as the frequency, types 
and locations of the measurements to be performed, should be documented in the radiation protection 
program. 
Radiation dose rates above established control limits should be investigated and timely action should be 
taken to address unusual conditions. 
Additional information the selection, testing and calibration of instruments and equipment is found in 
section 25. 
B.3 
Airborne radioactivity monitoring and control 
To ensure that adequate methods for the control of airborne radioactive contamination are in place, a 
program for the air sampling and control of airborne contaminants should be formalized in the radiation 
protection program with the objective of ensuring adequate protection of workers against the inhalation of 
airborne contaminants. As part of this program, the following measures should be taken: 
 
The generation of airborne radioactive contaminants in operations should be reduced to the extent 
reasonably feasible by the use of appropriate techniques such as the use of water and other 
suppression techniques and the use of appropriate equipment. Extra care should be taken for work 
July 2021 
REGDOC-2.7.1, Radiation Protection 
 
50 
 
that involves the opening of any radioactive system, and during the welding, burning or grinding of 
any surfaces where there is a potential for loose or fixed contamination. 
 
Where necessary and practicable, the source should be enclosed under negative air pressure. 
 
Care should be taken to avoid the resuspension of dust or any loose contamination as a result of high 
air velocities. 
Workplace air sampling should be performed in work areas to monitor concentrations of radionuclides in 
workers’ breathing zones to ensure that concentrations remain ALARA. Use of workplace air sampling 
equipment should include the following elements: 
 
Equipment located in an appropriate environment and position 
 
Quality control program 
 
Preventive maintenance program 
 
Appropriate minimum detection limits 
Performance specifications for airborne radioactivity monitoring instrumentation should be developed and 
documented in the radiation protection program. ANSI N42.17B-1989, American National Standard 
Performance Specifications for Health Physics Instrumentation: Occupational Airborne Radioactivity 
Monitoring Instrumentation [30], should be consulted for guiding principles. 
Continuous air monitors (CAMs) can be used in areas where airborne radioactivity levels can fluctuate or 
change rapidly due to an upset condition or nature of the work activities being performed. If CAMs are 
used, they should also be appropriately deployed throughout the facility. For example, CAMs should be 
deployed in work areas to provide immediate feedback to those working in the areas. Requirements and 
guidance on the placement of CAMs to ensure their effectiveness should be established in the radiation 
protection program. Consideration should be given to CAM placement that is representative of the 
workers’ breathing zone, including in work areas, areas where protective equipment is removed by 
workers after work completion, and nearby areas where workers are not typically donning respiratory 
protection. The operation and maintenance of CAMs should be performed in accordance with the 
licensee’s management system principles and requirements, which ensure that the systems are functioning 
as required. CAMs’ alarm set points should be set appropriately for the work areas and work activities 
where they are located. 
Testing and calibration of all air monitoring instrumentation and associated components (such as 
rotameters and pumps) must be done at regular intervals depending on the conditions of use, or at least 
annually. Additional guidance may be found in section 25. In addition, ANSI/IEEE N323c-2009, 
Radiation Protection Instrumentation Test and Calibration – Air Monitoring Instruments [31], should be 
consulted for guiding principles.

Appendix C: Monitoring for Radioactive Contamination 
This appendix provides general guidance on monitoring and controlling radioactive contamination and 
relating the monitoring results to contamination control limits specified in a CNSC licence or documented 
in a CNSC licensee’s radiation protection program, as applicable. The appendix also provides guidance 
on contamination monitoring instrument selection and a calibration process for contamination monitoring 
instruments for the purposes of section 25 of the RPR. 
Licensees must ensure appropriate calculations are used; the equations provided may not apply in all 
situations. The specific limitations of each equation are not included. 
C.1 
Method of measurement 
Radioactive contamination may be measured directly or indirectly. Direct measurement means the use of 
portable radiation detection instruments to detect both fixed and removable contamination. Direct 
measurement may be used when background radiation levels are negligible compared to licence criteria. 
Indirect measurement only detects removable contamination by means of a sampling program. 
C.2 
Purpose of  contamination monitoring 
Contamination monitoring, such as weekly wipe tests, is intended to confirm that operational controls that 
have been implemented to limit the spread of contamination are effective. Contamination monitoring 
should be performed at set locations, following a schedule, based on the risk for contamination. Follow up 
monitoring should be performed any time contamination is identified through routine monitoring or as 
identified and reported through other means.  
The locations selected for contamination monitoring should be numbered on a plan of the work area. 
These locations should include working surfaces (such as benches, countertops or fume hoods), storage 
areas and non-working surfaces (such as floors, instruments and equipment, door handles, light switches, 
sink taps and telephones). Several random locations should also be monitored. If the set of locations is too 
rigid, problem areas may be overlooked. A review of the list of locations should be conducted at a 
specific frequency to ensure that the list is current or determine whether new locations should be added as 
required. 
C.3 
Frequency of confirmatory contamination monitoring 
Contamination monitoring frequencies should conform to the requirements indicated in the licensee’s 
radiation protection program. When nuclear substances are not used for a prolonged period of time, 
contamination monitoring is not required, but such a period should be identified in the records. 
C.4 
Decontamination 
Any area that is found to have non-fixed contamination exceeding the contamination criteria should 
typically be cleaned and monitored again. If the area cannot be cleaned to meet those criteria, the 
contaminated area must be sealed or shielded until the criteria are met or some other provisions are made 
to ensure the contamination remains contained. 
Note: For short-lived radionuclides, the room or area may be posted with a radiation warning sign and 
secured until the radioisotope decays. 
July 2021 
REGDOC-2.7.1, Radiation Protection 
 
52 
 
C.5 
Monitoring records 
Contamination monitoring records should include: 
 
date of measurement 
 
name of the person performing the measurement 
 
make and model of the instrument 
 
monitoring locations 
 
contamination monitoring results in Bq/cm2 before and after decontamination, if applicable 
 
results of operational tests and background measurements 
 
standard measurement results 
 
measured or predicted efficiency 
 
recording and updating of instrument servicing records as necessary 
 
demonstration that the chosen instrument and counting methods yield a minimum detectable activity 
below the applicable criteria 
C.6 
Direct measurement of contamination using a portable meter 
Direct measurement instrument readings include both fixed and non-fixed contamination. Subsequently, a 
direct reading may be used to satisfy licence criteria for non-fixed contamination. 
However, in cases where licensees have separate criteria for both fixed and removable contamination, 
wipes, followed by decontamination, followed by direct measurements, should be performed. 
C.7 
Indirect measurement of contamination with wipes 
The following steps may be used for indirect measurements of removable contamination with wipes. 
Wipe each of the locations shown on the plan of the working area with a filter paper, wipe or cotton swab. 
The wipe may be dry, or lightly moistened with alcohol or water to improve collection efficiency. 
However, if a wetting agent is used, contamination may be absorbed into the wipe material, and may lead 
to a significant underestimate of alpha and low-energy beta contamination with some counting methods. 
For example, alpha counting should not be conducted on a wet wipe. 
Use one numbered wipe per location. If contamination is found, the contaminated area must be identified 
and decontaminated. 
The area to be surveyed (wiped) should be as identified in the workplace monitoring program. Using 
uniform and constant pressure, wipe the entire area.  
Count the wipes in a low-background area and record all results. 
If the wipes are to be counted on a contamination meter, the wipe should be smaller than or equal to the 
sensitive area of the detector. Note that the geometry of the wipe material (flat like filter paper or round 
like a swab) may change results. 
Clean any contaminated areas and monitor again. Record results before and after decontamination.

REGDOC-2.7.1, Radiation Protection

C.8 
Detector efficiency 
Each instrument must be calibrated to determine its detection efficiency using traceable, uniform planar 
sources with an active area of similar dimensions to the detector, where practical. The nuclear substance 
used should emit radiation similar to that of the potential contaminant. The objectives are: 
 
to determine the operating voltage for each detector, especially interchangeable probes; other 
electrical and mechanical features may also be tested 
 
to obtain or confirm the detection efficiency of the instrument for each relevant radionuclide 
The detector efficiency depends upon: 
 
the type of detector (e.g., Geiger-Müller, NaI scintillation, plastic/organic scintillation, proportional 
counter) 
 
the detector size and shape 
 
the distance from the detector to the radioactive material 
 
the nuclear substance and type of radiation measured (alpha, beta and gamma radiations and their 
energies) 
 
the backscatter of radiation toward the detector 
 
the absorption of the radiation before it reaches the detector (by air, by the material itself, and by the 
detector covering) 
The detector efficiency can be determined by: 
 
counting an appropriate standard source of known activity with your detector, in counts per second 
(cps)5: 
absolute efficiency = 
𝑑𝑒𝑡𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑜𝑟 𝑐𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑡 𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑒−𝑏𝑎𝑐𝑘𝑔𝑟𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑑 𝑐𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑡 𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑒
𝑘𝑛𝑜𝑤𝑛 𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑖𝑡𝑦 𝑜𝑓 𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑎𝑟𝑑 𝑠𝑜𝑢𝑟𝑐𝑒
 
 
referring to the documentation supplied by the vendor for your specific nuclear substance(s); if not 
specified, by contacting the vendor for the required information 
Even low levels of surface contamination may give rise to a risk of internal exposure. Portable 
contamination monitoring instruments have detection efficiencies ranging from 0 to 40% (at best) for 
different nuclear substances (excluding contributions from progeny in secular equilibrium6 ). 
Measurements must therefore be made using an efficiency-checked instrument with the best available 
predetermined detection efficiency for the radionuclide(s) of concern.  
C.9 
Relating measurement readings to contamination criteria 
The readings from contamination meters can be related to contamination criteria if the efficiency of the 
instrument for a specific nuclear substance is known. Using the detection efficiency, a response can then 
                                                     
 
 
5 If the source surface area exceeds the detector surface area, then appropriate correction should be applied to 
account for the actual activity from the standard source seen by the detector. 
6 Secular equilibrium is a type of radioactive equilibrium in which the half-life of the precursor (parent) radioisotope 
is so much longer than that of the product (progeny) that the radioactivity of the progeny becomes equal to that of 
the parent with time. 
July 2021 
REGDOC-2.7.1, Radiation Protection 
 
54 
 
be provided to convert the reading to surface activity concentration (in Bq/cm2). The linearity of response 
and inter-range differences may also be investigated.  
Examples of acceptable approaches for mixtures of nuclear substances include identifying the isotope for 
which the detector has the lowest response at the applicable contamination limit, or use of a source that 
contains the nuclear substance mixture to be measured. This can be done by multiplying the 
contamination limit (Bq/cm2) by the detector efficiency (counts/Bq) by the area measured (cm2). The 
result will indicate the lowest count that would indicate the presence of contamination at the limit. The 
nuclear substance associated with the lowest count rate at the limit is the most restrictive when using that 
instrument. Combinations of instruments may be required to demonstrate compliance with the limits for 
nuclear substance mixtures. 
Using the following equation, calculate the measurement results in Bq/cm2: 
Removable activity =  
𝑁−𝑁𝐵
𝐸 ×60 × 𝐴 × 𝐹 
Where: 
N = total count rate in counts per minute (cpm) measured directly or on the wipe 
NB =  normal background count rate (in cpm) from a portable survey instrument or the count rate (in 
cpm) from measuring a blank wipe using a benchtop instrument 
E =  instrument efficiency factor (expressed as a decimal, i.e., for 5% efficiency, E=0.05) for the 
nuclear substance being measured. Consult the manufacturer or determine using a nuclear 
substance with a known amount of activity in a counting geometry similar to that used when 
surveying for contamination 
60 =  sec/min 
A =  area wiped (typically not to exceed 100 cm2 with the exception of applying the Packaging and 
Transport of Nuclear Substances Regulation, 2015, for areas of 300 cm2) or open detector area 
in cm2 (for direct measurement) 
F =  collection factor for the wipe (used only when calculating indirect wipe monitoring results).  
If F is not determined experimentally, a value of F=0.1 (i.e., 10%) must be used 
C.10 Minimum detectable activity 
The minimum detectable activity (MDA) is defined as the minimum amount of activity in a sample that 
can be detected with a 5% probability of erroneously detecting radioactivity when none is present, and, a 
5% probability of not detecting radioactivity when it is present. For any given system designed to count 
and quantify radioactivity, the MDA is calculated for the most restrictive scenario (e.g., for the nuclide 
that has lowest detection efficiency and most restrictive regulatory criterion). The units of the MDA (Bq, 
Bq/g, Bq/cm2) should be the same as those expressed in the licence or regulatory criterion, as applicable. 
The MDA, in Bq/cm2, can be calculated as follows: 
MDA (Bq/cm2) = 
2.71+4.66√𝑁𝐵×[𝑇60
⁄
]
𝐸 × 𝑇 × 𝐴 ×𝐹 
 
July 2021 
REGDOC-2.7.1, Radiation Protection 
 
55 
 
See appendix C.9 for the meaning of the terms NB, E, A and F. “T” is the counting time, in seconds, for 
indirect wipe monitoring, and is the instrument response time for direct measurements (or the actual time 
if performing scalar counting). For scanning/frisking, T is equal to the detector width (cm) divided by the 
scanning speed (cm/s).The instrument response time will vary between instruments and is a parameter 
that can be selected by the user on some devices, that is, via either software selection of the actual time, or 
a “fast/slow” switch set to predefined times specified in the user manual. Other instruments may auto-
select the response time based on the count rate. Longer response times will improve the MDA.  
Note: The efficiency, and hence the MDA, of the instrument is highly dependent on the distance between 
the source and the detector. The MDA should be calculated for the distance at which the detector will be 
when monitoring. 
C.11 Calculating and reporting results with uncertainty 
Licensees should be in a position to calculate the associated 2σ uncertainty (i.e., 95% confidence) for any 
measurement that is made and compared against a contamination criterion specified in a CNSC licence or 
documented in a CNSC licensee’s RP program. The requirement to report and/or document the 
uncertainties associated to radiation measurements will depend on the circumstances. For example, a 
decommissioning report or formal laboratory report should provide uncertainty values next to each 
measurement above the MDA. Conversely, a logbook maintained by a licensee, for example, showing 
count rates measured on the surface of items or clothing with a contamination meter at a zone boundary 
would not require the inclusion of uncertainty values. Licensees should nonetheless ensure that any 
threshold or trigger value in cpm (or cps) used to ensure compliance against a surface activity criterion is 
both above the MDA of the instrument, and corresponds to an activity value sufficiently below the 
regulatory criterion being compared against as to account for typical uncertainties given the counting 
conditions. The 2σ uncertainty can be calculated as follows for measurements reported in Bq/cm2: 
2σ uncertainty (Bq/cm2) = ± 2 × 
√𝑁×[𝑇60
⁄
]+ 𝑁𝐵×[𝑇60
⁄
]
𝐸 ×𝑇 × 𝐴 ×𝐹
 
See appendix C.9 for the meaning of the terms N, NB, E, A, and F, and appendix C.10 for T, which is 
assumed to be the same value for both the background and sample. 
C.12 Instrument sensitivity 
Portable and benchtop contamination monitoring instruments must be capable of making reproducible 
measurements below any applicable contamination criteria. Licensees must be able to demonstrate that 
for the nuclear substance(s) of interest, the corresponding contamination criterion or limit specified in a 
CNSC licence or documented in a CNSC licensee’s RP program can be detected using the proposed 
instrumentation. This requires determination of both the MDA for the detector and isotope of interest, and 
the uncertainty (2σ). There are various methods for ensuring that the chosen counting time translates to an 
MDA that is sufficiently below the contamination criterion of interest. 
The following are 2 examples of how to establish adequate instrument sensitivity for a given nuclear 
substance: 
1) For conservatism, the MDA was set at 0.5 times the applicable contamination criterion or limit: 
2.71 + 4.66√𝑁𝐵× [𝑇60
⁄
]
𝐸 ×  𝑇 ×  𝐴 × 𝐹 
 ≤0.5 × 𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑎𝑚𝑖𝑛𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 𝑙𝑖𝑚𝑖𝑡 
July 2021 
REGDOC-2.7.1, Radiation Protection 
 
56 
 
 
2) Assume that a typical measurement near the applicable criterion is twice the background 
measurement (i.e., N = 2NB) and that the counting time T is identical for both: 
2.71 + 4.66√𝑁𝐵× [𝑇60
⁄
]
𝐸 ×  𝑇 ×  𝐴 × 𝐹 
+  2
√3𝑁𝐵× [𝑇60
⁄
]
𝐸 × 𝑇 ×  𝐴 × 𝐹≤𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑎𝑚𝑖𝑛𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 𝑙𝑖𝑚𝑖𝑡 
Which equates to: 
2.71 + 8.12√𝑁𝐵× [𝑇60
⁄
]
𝐸 ×  𝑇 ×  𝐴 × 𝐹 
≤𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑎𝑚𝑖𝑛𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 𝑙𝑖𝑚𝑖𝑡 
See appendix C.9 for the meaning of the terms NB, E, A, and F, and appendix C.10 for T, which is 
assumed to be the same value for both the background and the sample. 
C.13 Selection of contamination monitoring instruments 
The MDA for a nuclear substance will depend on both the types and energies of radiation emitted by that 
nuclear substance, and on the type of detector used. In general, there are 3 basic detector design 
considerations that will impact instrument sensitivity, and each of these parameters will have a different 
impact, depending upon the type and energy of radiation being detected. 
C.13.1 
Window thickness and composition 
Consideration should be given to whether the window density is small enough to allow the radiation 
emitted by source to enter the detector. This is critical for low-energy beta radiation and alpha radiation, 
which can be completely absorbed, even by materials as thin as a sheet of paper. Note that some isotopes, 
such as H-3 or Ni-63, cannot be detected by most instruments because the beta radiation they emit gets 
completely absorbed within the window. For such isotopes, indirect monitoring using liquid scintillation 
is generally the best choice. 
C.13.2 
Detector density 
Every radiation detector functions by detecting interactions between the radiation and a material within 
the detector. There are 2 broad classes of detectors: gas-filled detectors, and solid or liquid scintillators. 
Gas-filled detectors, such as Geiger detectors and proportional counters, will generally work well for 
detecting alpha or beta radiation, since these types of radiation will cause interactions even in low-density 
materials. Conversely, gamma rays may readily pass through a low-density gas without interaction, 
especially at high energies. Solid scintillators, such as NaI detectors, are generally much better suited to 
detecting gamma radiation. Thin crystal detectors are suitable for low-energy gamma emitters such as 
Tc-99m, while thicker detectors will enhance sensitivity for high-energy gammas such as those from 
Cs-137 or Co-60. 
C.13.3 
Detector output 
Every time radiation interacts with a detector, a tiny amount of energy is released within the detector. 
This energy is then converted into an electronic signal that can be measured. Some detectors, such as 
Geiger counters, produce uniform pulses, which can be counted. Other systems, such as scintillators or 
July 2021 
REGDOC-2.7.1, Radiation Protection 
 
57 
 
proportional counters, may produce a signal that is proportional to the amount of energy released in the 
initial radiation interaction. This can be used to distinguish between different types of radiation or 
different energies of radiation of the same type. Such detectors are useful in applications for which 
distinguishing between multiple different isotopes may be necessary. 
Table C.1 provides guidance on recommended applications of a variety of hand-held and non-portable 
contamination monitoring instruments.

1 Ion chambers are another major type of portable detector. These devices are intended for measurement 
of radiation dose rates rather than contamination. In general, they are poorly suited to contamination 
monitoring and should not be used for this purpose. 
2 Nuclear substances that decay via emission of alpha or beta particles often also emit gamma rays. Many 
isotopes, especially high atomic number materials such as uranium and radium, may exist in equilibrium 
with the other isotopes in their “decay chain,” which in turn emit many different types and energies of 
radiation. When choosing a contamination monitor, it is important to consider exactly what types of 
radiation will be present. For example, positron emission tomography isotopes decay by the emission of a

59 
 
positron (beta+), which in turn produces 2 high-energy (511 keV) gamma rays. It is the gamma rays that 
are of primary importance in the use of these isotopes, and a thick crystal NaI scintillator will detect these 
gammas very efficiently. However, a thin-window Geiger detector will detect the beta+ emissions even 
more efficiently, and will generally have a much lower background (NB) count rate.

Information Booklet [28].

Appendix D: Calibration of Radiation Survey Meters and Direct Reading 
Dosimeters 
This appendix provides an example calibration process for radiation survey meters and direct reading 
dosimeters (DRDs) that are used to conduct radiation measurements that are directly compared against a 
regulatory criterion and/or limit. A similar approach for calibrating radiation survey meters and DRDs 
should be taken by licensees as per the example calibration process in this appendix.  
Nothing in the appendix shall be construed to imply that the CNSC authorizes, certifies or licences 
persons to conduct survey meter and DRD calibrations. It is the responsibility of the licensee to ensure 
that any person conducting a radiation survey meter and DRD calibration on their behalf can do so in 
accordance with CNSC regulatory requirements. This should be performed using the licensee’s contractor 
validation and verification process management system. 
D.1 
Calibration procedure documentation 
To ensure the calibration of a radiation survey meter or DRD is done correctly and consistently, a 
documented calibration procedure includes: 
 
a general description of the method of calibration 
 
an identification and proof of verification of uncertainties associated with the jig, the exposure or air 
kerma (Ka) reference rate, the source activity, the attenuators, and the decay correction that are 
associated with the total uncertainty of the calibration 
 
step-by-step procedures, preferably including manufacturers’ manuals, to show that sufficient 
information about the radiation survey meter or DRD is available to operate, to perform pre-
calibration checks and to calibrate the radiation survey meter or DRD 
D.2 
Radiation survey meter pre-calibration check 
The pre-calibration check of the radiation survey meter consists of: 
 
a battery check to ensure a satisfactory voltage as per the manufacturer’s specifications (as 
applicable) can be maintained throughout the calibration 
 
a verification of operating voltage as applicable 
 
a comprehensive functional check on all ranges of the radiation survey meter as applicable 
D.3 
Physical and environmental conditions for jigs and radiation survey meters or 
direct reading dosimeters 
For the calibration to be accurate, the beam calibrator jig and the radiation survey meter or DRD are 
configured in the following manner: 
1. To minimize radiation scatter, the jig is at least 0.5 metre (m) from the floor, the ceiling and any wall. 
July 2021 
REGDOC-2.7.1, Radiation Protection 
 
61 
 
2. The distance between any scattering object and the source is at least 0.5 m7: 
a. in an area free of interference from sources of ionizing radiation other than the calibration source, 
and 
b. in an area where electrostatic, electrical and magnetic fields and other non-ionizing radiation, 
such as radio frequency and microwave, will not affect instrument response. 
3. The radiation survey meter or DRD to be calibrated: 
a. is positioned on the jig to minimize bias due to geotropism, directional dependence, and non-
uniformity of the source radiation beam across and through the detector volume 
b. has any beta window or shield in the optimum position (normally closed) for best (i.e., flattest) 
energy response and 
c. in the case of a DRD that is used as the primary dosimetry for a worker, is placed on a torso 
phantom (30 cm x 30 cm x 15 cm), or alternate torso phantom surrogate, to be consistent with the 
intended application of the dosimeter. 
4. The uncertainty in calibration distance cannot be greater than 2% and is the quadratic sum of the 
uncertainty of the jig distance scale, the uncertainty in physical placement and repositioning of the 
radiation survey meter or DRD, the uncertainty in location of the source centre when on the jig, and 
the uncertainty of the centre of the sensitive volume of the radiation survey meter detector. 
5. The calibration is carried out where the level of background radiation is known and the appropriate 
corrections are made to compensate for the contribution from this potential source of error. This is 
particularly important when measuring at the lowest ranges on the radiation survey meter or DRD. 
D.4 
Calibration sources 
It is preferable to use the same reference isotope as the manufacturer for the calibration source, especially 
if the manufacturer's specified energy response is to be assumed. Whatever isotope is used, the energy 
dependence of the dose rate response of the device to be calibrated is known and is within 30% of the true 
dose rate over the energy spectrum of interest. 
If the conventionally true dose rate is established directly from a source activity, the calibration source 
activity is known to an uncertainty of not greater than ± 10%. This uncertainty includes attenuators (used 
singly or in combination) if they are an integral part of the source assembly. The calibration source is 
traceable through a source supplier to a national or international standard, and the calibration source 
activity is corrected for decay at a frequency to ensure its activity is within 1% of its specified value. 
Conventionally true doses of radiation can be established using the following dose rate conversion factors 
from a known source activity.

Note: Air kerma and effective dose calculated based on the ICRP’s fluence-to-dose conversion 
coefficients (linearly interpolated when necessary) provided in ICRP Publication 116, Conversion 
Coefficients for Radiological Protection Quantities for External Radiation Exposures [32]. Fluence was 
calculated based on the photon energies and probabilities obtained from the Nuclear Energy Agency’s 
(NEA) Joint Evaluated Fission and Fusion File (JEFF) 3.1 nuclide library [33]. All photon emissions 
above 15 keV with a probability above 0.01% were considered in the calculation. Operational quantities 
calculated based on the air-kerma-to-dose conversion coefficients (linearly interpolated when necessary) 
provided in ICRP Publication 74, Conversion Coefficients for Use in Radiological Protection Against 
External Radiation [34].  
If the conventionally true dose rate is established using a measurement of exposure or air kerma rate, a 
calibration certificate is needed for any transfer standards (e.g., ion chamber and electrometer) used to 
make the measurement. Exposure rates (R/h) are converted to air kerma rates in Grays per hour (Gy/h) 
using the following conversion: 1 R = 0.00876 Gy. Air kerma rates are then converted to the operational 
quantities H*10 for the purposes of calibrating gamma dose rate meters and Hp10 for the purposes of 
calibrating electronic DRDs measuring deep gamma dose using the following conversion factors: 
Cs-137: H*10: 1.204 Sv/Gy, Hp10: 1.215 Sv/Gy 
Co-60: H*10: 1.160 Sv/Gy, Hp10: 1.153 Sv/Gy

Radiation survey meter calibration 
Each radiation survey meter is calibrated up to its highest range. The manufacturer's recommended 
calibration method, if any, is followed, and the calibration is verified at approximately 20 to 25% and 75 
to 80% of the measurement of each range. For auto-ranging meters, the calibration is verified at a 
minimum of one dose rate per decade throughout the meter’s entire operating dose rate range. Meters 
cannot be placed at a distance smaller than 0.5 m from the source of radiation. 
When possible, dose rates measured using survey meters are performed using a scaler function, with a 
minimum integration time of 60 seconds. When scaler functions are not available, the meter can be 
exposed for 60 seconds in the beam, followed by another 60-second exposure where readings are 
observed remotely, with the highest and lowest dose rate readings noted. The measured dose rate reading 
is the average of both readings. 
Measurements are recorded before and after any necessary (or preferred) calibration adjustments. A 
survey meter meets the criteria for calibration when each observed measurement is within ± 20% of the 
conventionally true dose rate.

If dose rates cannot be delivered throughout a meter’s entire range, this limitation is clearly stipulated on 
the calibration certificate with the maximum calibrated dose rate displayed on the calibration sticker. 
However, each range is checked to ensure response and, as far as practicable, by decreasing the 
calibration distance and confirming the increasing dose rate response. 
D.6 
Direct reading dosimeter calibration 
The manufacturer's recommended calibration method for the DRD, if any, is followed.  
For each dose measurement made using a DRD, the exposure time in the beam is a minimum of 
60 seconds. Measurements are recorded before and after any necessary (or preferred) calibration 
adjustments. A DRD meets the criteria for calibration when each observed measurement is within ± 20% 
of the conventionally true dose rate. 
Dose measurements are made at dose rates that are equivalent to 0.01%, 0.1%, 1% and 10% of the 
manufacturer’s specified maximum dose rate, up to the highest dose rates that can be achieved at a 
distance no smaller than 0.5 m from the calibration source. 
For pencil-type ion chamber DRDs, a single dose delivered between 20% and 80% of the measurement 
dose range at any dose rate is considered adequate. If so equipped, the alarm features of DRDs (e.g., for 
dose rate and cumulative dose levels) are verified to operate at the required alarm set points. 
D.7 
Record of calibration 
Following calibration, the person performing the calibration completes a record of calibration, and 
completes and affixes to the radiation survey meter or DRD a durable calibration sticker bearing the date 
of calibration, or the date for the required future calibration. The person conducting the calibration returns 
the original record of calibration with the radiation survey meter or DRD to the user. 
If a radiation survey meter or DRD fails to meet the criteria for calibration, the person conducting the 
calibration immediately notifies the person who requested the calibration. 
If requested to do so, the person conducting the calibration may, if qualified through training or other 
certification, repair a radiation survey meter or DRD before returning it to the user. Subsequent to any 
repair that exceeds the manufacturer’s instructions for normal maintenance, a radiation survey meter or 
DRD is recalibrated. 
A record of calibration for each radiation survey meter or DRD includes the following information, as 
applicable: 
1. Licensee name and CNSC licence number 
2. Radiation survey meter or DRD make and model, including serial number of the detector unit and the 
probe used in the calibration, if applicable 
3. Calibration source used, including isotope and activity, or the voltage, current, and effective energy 
for X-ray calibration sources 
4. Results of the calibration, including: 
a. battery condition, if applicable 
b. operating voltage, if applicable 
c. temperature, pressure and humidity, at the time of calibration

d. the conventionally true dose rate(s) used for the calibration, along with the applicable operational 
quantity and total uncertainty for each range on the radiation survey meter or DRD that was 
calibrated 
e. the observed dose rate(s) on the radiation survey meter or DRD, with units, including both pre- 
and post-calibration, for each range on the radiation survey meter or DRD that was calibrated 
f. the calculated percent variance of the observed dose rate versus the conventionally true dose rate 
g. any notes of concerns or anomalies for that range 
h. any notes of anomalies or problems associated with the calibration of the radiation survey meter 
or DRD, in general 
i. 
the date of the calibration of the radiation survey meter or DRD 
j. 
the name and signature of the person who conducted the calibration 
k. acknowledgement that the calibration was carried out in accordance with these requirements 
A record of each radiation survey meter or DRD calibration is retained by the licensee, as required by the 
NSCA and regulations, and for the period specified in the licence or the regulations, as appropriate.
