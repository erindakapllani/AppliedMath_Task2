Preface 
This regulatory document is part of the CNSC’s security series of regulatory documents, which also 
covers high-security facilities and site security. The full list of regulatory document series is included at 
the end of this document and can also be found on the CNSC’s website. 
Part A of Regulatory document REGDOC-2.12.3, Security of Nuclear Substances: Sealed Sources and 
Category I, II and III Nuclear Material, sets out the minimum security measures that licensees must 
implement to prevent the loss, sabotage, illegal use, illegal possession or illegal removal of sealed sources 
during their entire lifecycle, including while the sources are in storage, transport or being stored during 
transportation.  
Part B of this document also provides information and guidance on how to comply with the minimum 
security measures, including measures related to transport vehicles, containers and security plans for 
Categories I, II or III Nuclear Material.  
This document sets out guidance to help applicants for a Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC) 
licence in respect of Category I or II nuclear material – other than a licence to transport – or a nuclear 
facility consisting of a nuclear reactor that may exceed 10 MW thermal power during normal operation, to 
prepare and submit the security information to be included with the application, pursuant to the Nuclear 
Safety and Control Act.  
This document also sets out guidance to help applicants for a CNSC licence to transport Category I, II or 
III nuclear material to prepare and submit a “written transportation security plan” that meets the 
requirements of section 5 of the Nuclear Security Regulations. Category I, II and III nuclear material are 
defined in appendix E to this guide. 
This document is Version 2.1. It supersedes Version 2, which was published in June 2019. A document 
that shows the changes made to REGDOC-2.12.3, Version 2 is available from the CNSC upon request.

Security of Nuclear Substances: Sealed Sources and Category I, II and III Nuclear 
Material, Version 2 
1. Introduction 
1.1 Purpose 
Part A of regulatory document REGDOC-2.12.3, Security of Nuclear Substances: Sealed Sources and 
Category I, II and III Nuclear Material, Version 2, sets out the minimum security measures that 
licensees must implement to prevent the loss, sabotage, illegal use, illegal possession or illegal 
removal of sealed sources during their entire lifecycle, including while they are in storage or 
transport, or being stored during transportation. If third-party carriers are used to transport 
radioactive material, this document also sets out the minimum security measures that a licensee 
must ensure a carrier of sealed sources complies with while the sealed sources are in transport or 
being stored during transportation. 
Part B of this document sets out guidance to help applicants prepare and submit the security 
information to be included with an application for a licence in respect of Category I or II nuclear 
material or a nuclear facility. It also provides guidance for applicants to prepare a “written 
transportation security plan” with respect to a licence to transport Category I, II or III nuclear 
material. 
1.2 Scope 
Part A of this document describes the minimum security measures required for the use, storage and 
transport of sealed sources, and includes measures for both technical and administrative security. 
It includes measures related to transport vehicles, containers and security plans. This document 
also provides information and guidance on how to meet the security requirements. 
Part A applies to sealed radioactive sources (encapsulated or solid) and does not apply to unsealed 
radioactive substances. This document applies to Category 1, 2, and 3 sources and provides 
“prudent management practices” for Category 4 and 5 sources. The terms “Category 1 sources” to 
“Category 5 sources” are used as defined in the International Atomic Energy Agency’s (IAEA) 
Code of Conduct on the Safety and Security of Radioactive Sources [1], IAEA Safety Guide RS-G-
1.9, Categorization of Radioactive Sources [2] or IAEA/TECDOC-1344,  Categorization of 
Radioactive Sources [3] (see glossary). 
Part B of this document describes the recommended security measures for the storage and/or 
transport of nuclear materials. It describes the information that should be present in a licensee’s 
security program description or transportation security plan. The document also provides details 
on how these plans should be handled in order to meet confidentiality and national security 
requirements. 
Part B applies to applicants for a licence with respect to Category I, II or III nuclear material as 
well as nuclear facilities consisting of a nuclear reactor. In this document, the terms Category I, II 
and III nuclear material are used as defined in the Nuclear Security Regulations (NSR) (see 
appendix E). 
Other federal requirements related to the transport of Category I, II or III nuclear material, such as 
those pertaining to packaging, documentation and safety markings, can be found in the Packaging

Part A – Sealed Sources 
2. Background 
Sealed sources and prescribed equipment containing nuclear substances are regulated under the 
NSCA and the regulations made under the NSCA, such as the GNSCR, Class II Nuclear Facilities 
and Prescribed Equipment Regulation, NSRDR and the RPR. 
Additional regulations related to the transport of sources (such as packaging, documentation and 
safety markings) include: 
 
Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC), PTNSR 2015 
 
Transport Canada, TDGR 
This document uses a graded approach for the security of sealed sources. There are five levels of 
sealed sources (Categories 1 through 5). This document provides requirements that apply to 
radioactive sealed sources that may pose a significant risk to the environment and the health and 
safety of persons (i.e., Category 1, 2 and 3 sources). As Categories 4 and 5 are low-risk sealed 
sources, this document provides no requirements, but rather prudent management practices for 
managing those categories. 
In September 2003, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) approved the Code of 
Conduct on the Safety and Security of Radioactive Sources [1]. Canada, along with many other 
countries, has undertaken to abide by this Code and work toward its full implementation. 
REGDOC-2.12.3, Security of Nuclear Substances: Sealed Sources and Category I, II and III Nuclear 
Material supports the regulatory framework to enforce international guidelines set by the IAEA 
and provides consistency in the application of security measures. 
The PTNSR 2015 apply to consignors, consignees and carriers. However, subcontractors are not 
licensed by the CNSC and, therefore, are not subject to the security requirements applicable to 
CNSC licensees. This regulatory document is intended to assist licensees with contracting carriers 
to ensure that specific security measures are taken into consideration when transporting sealed 
sources or nuclear material, when storing sealed sources or nuclear material, or when storing 
sealed sources or nuclear material while in transit. 
REGDOC-2.12.3, Security of Nuclear Substances: Sealed Sources and Category I, II, and III 
Nuclear Material, reflects the security goals of United Nations specialized agencies and programs 
– including the International Maritime Organization, the International Civil Aviation Organization 
and other intergovernmental organizations such as the International Carriage by Rail – as they 
have taken similar steps to provide improved security in the transport of dangerous goods carried 
by sea, air and rail. These organizations have developed various instruments, such as the 
International Maritime Dangerous Goods Code, and technical instructions for the safe transport 
of dangerous goods by air. 
2.1 Application 
Part A applies to sealed sources and radionuclides identified in Table 1. These substances and 
threshold values are based on the IAEA Code of Conduct on the Safety and Security of Radioactive 
Sources [1]. The main objective of this regulatory document is the protection of the health and safety 
of persons and the environment from the dangers associated with radioactive sources.

As outlined in IAEA TECDOC-1344 [3], if a practice involves the accumulation of several 
sources into a single storage or use location, where these sources are in close proximity or 
collocated (such as in storage facilities, manufacturing processes, or transport conveyance), the 
total activity is treated as a single source for the purpose of assigning a category. When sources 
are stored or used in separate controlled locations, they may have independent security measures 
commensurate with the activity level of the source; in this case, aggregation considerations are not 
applicable. In some circumstances, an entire site is not considered a single controlled use or 
storage location. 
The security requirements must be commensurate with the categorization, threat level and/or level 
of risk set by the licensee or the Government of Canada. Note that mobile and portable radioactive 
sources may need to be treated differently, to ensure that any specific security requirements are 
fulfilled, thereby allowing the source to be used as intended. 
2.2 Categorization of sources 
The CNSC bases its categorization of sources on the IAEA source categorization, defined in 
IAEA TECDOC-1344 [3]. This document recognizes that not all radioactive sources could (or 
should) be treated alike, and has established five source categories, ranging from Category 1 
(extremely dangerous) to Category 5 (unlikely to be dangerous). The IAEA categorization 
methodology has found worldwide acceptance, and provides a uniform means of classifying the 
risk associated with the most commonly used sealed sources and radiation devices. 
Sealed sources and radiation devices may be used in one location (for example, fixed gauges used 
on process equipment), or they may be mobile and used on different job sites (for example, 
radiography exposure devices and portable soil moisture density gauges). 
Category 1 sources are the most risk significant sealed sources licensed by the CNSC. Because 
they pose the greatest risk to the health and safety of persons and to the environment, Category 1 
sources are always used in a well-shielded and well-controlled location. Examples include cobalt-
60 teletherapy sources used for cancer treatment and cobalt-60 sources used in pool-type 
irradiators to sterilize medical products. Such sources must be shielded and secured safely. 
Category 2 sources are most often industrial radiography exposure devices. These devices are 
portable, and are widely used in pipeline work and in pressure vessel fabrication shops 
(particularly in the oil and gas industry). 
Category 3 sources are often fixed gauges that are bolted to pipes, vessels and assembly lines 
where they operate reliably in harsh industrial environments, often for decades. 
Category 4 sources are less risk significant than Category 3 sources, and are classified as low risk 
to persons, security and the environment. An example of a Category 4 source is a portable soil 
moisture density gauge used in road construction. 
Category 5 sources and their use are considered to be the least risk significant. Examples include 
electron capture detectors used to measure pesticide residues in food, x-ray fluorescence 
analyzers, and low-dose brachytherapy implant sources. Some Category 5 sources may be used 
without a CNSC licence. 
Table 1 provides thresholds of Category 1, 2 and 3 sources, measured in activity level. Appendix 
C provides examples of Category 1, 2 and 3 sources by “use type”.

2.2.1 
Thresholds for the activity levels 
The materials and thresholds in Table 1 are based on the IAEA Code of Conduct on the Safety 
and Security of Radioactive Sources [1]. These thresholds aim to provide consistency between 
domestic and international requirements for the protection of radioactive material. 
The IAEA Code of Conduct on the Safety  and Security of Radioactive Sources  [1] lists 16 
radionuclides that could pose a serious threat to the health and safety of people and to the 
environment. Irradiated fuel and mixed oxide fuel are not included in the list even though they 
contain quantities of radioactive material; these materials are covered by the NSR. 
The terabecquerel (TBq) is the official measurement unit used for determining whether a 
radioactive material is a Category 1, 2, or 3 source. Because many licensees use Curies in their 
activities instead of Becquerels, the table also provides the equivalent Curie (Ci) measurement, for 
practical usefulness. 
IAEA RS-G-1.9, Categorization of Radioactive Sources [2] provides the methodology for the 
development of the Code of Conduct thresholds. 
The IAEA regulatory requirements apply only to sealed sources. However, it is recommended that 
comparable security requirements be taken into account for open or unsealed sources when 
considering the suitability and adequacy of the storage arrangements. 
2.2.2 
Methodology for assigning a category 
To assign a category, the total activity of all sources in one facility (storage or use) where sources 
are in close proximity must be equal to, or greater than, the number identified in the category. For 
example: 
 
a teletherapy medical device with a sealed source up to 555 TBq of cobalt-60 is a Category 1 
source (555 > 30) 
 
a certified radiography exposure device with a sealed source of 2.5 TBq of iridium-192 is a 
Category 2 sealed source (80 > 2.5 > 0.8) 
 
a high dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy medical device with a sealed source up to 0.44 TBq of 
iridium-192 is a Category 3 source (0.8 > 0.44 > 0.08) 
For security control purposes, the aggregation of sources in a single storage (or use) facility can be 
used to determine a security category. This is done by adding the actual sealed source activities of 
the sources and determining the category from Table 1. For example, one industrial level gauge 
containing a sealed source with 0.19 TBq of cesium-137 is a Category 3 source (1.0 > 0.19 > 0.1). 
However, when there are six of these sealed sources at a single licensed location, for security 
reasons they may be treated as a Category 2 source (6 x 0.19 = 1.1 > 1.0). 
The A/D ratio for a single radionuclide is the activity (A) of the source compared to the activity 
determined to define a threshold of danger (D). For the aggregation of various radionuclides, the 
sum of the A/D ratios is used to determine a final category as described in RS-G-1.9,  
Categorization of Radioactive Sources [2] and TECDOC-1344, Categorization of Radioactive 
Sources [3] . If multiple sources from different categories are stored, the highest category should 
suffice (e.g., storage of Category 2, 3 and 4 sources would meet the security requirements for 
Category 2).

3. Security Measures 
3.1 General security measures 
While in storage or use, licensees shall develop and implement technical and administrative 
security measures to protect the radioactive source against unauthorized removal (such as theft or 
loss) or sabotage. 
As outlined in IAEA TECDOC-1355 [5], these measures shall integrate safety and security 
concepts involving industrial safety arrangements, radiation protection measures and appropriate 
design to achieve the necessary level of protection against unauthorized removal of radioactive 
sources. 
Guidance 
The security program should include security measures relating to detection, delay and response to 
security events (e.g., alarm detection devices, fencing, secured storage containers, immobilization 
of vehicles and/or trailers, and security officers). 
The licensee should develop and maintain a threat and risk assessment to determine vulnerabilities 
in the existing physical protection systems designed to protect against the loss, sabotage, illegal 
use, illegal possession, or illegal removal during the storage or transportation of sealed sources. 
This could include: 
 
identification of assets that require protection 
 
credible threats 
 
mitigation measures to minimize any identified threats, risks or vulnerabilities 
The threat and risk assessment should be reviewed annually and updated as required based on 
changes that affect the threat level. 
The degree of rigor of a threat and risk assessment should follow the graded approach and should 
be commensurate with the category and risks associated with the sealed sources. This threat and 
risk assessment may be incorporated into existing assessments. 
Table 2 provides information on how security program subsections must be applied to Category 1 
(high risk), Category 2 (high risk), Category 3 (medium risk), and Categories 4 and 5 (low risk).

3.2 Technical security measures 
Technical security measures for radioactive sources, devices or facilities shall include physical 
measures to: 
 
prevent unauthorized personnel from gaining access to such sources 
 
protect against an act or attempted act of unauthorized removal 
 
protect against an act or attempted act of sabotage 
Technical security measures shall also include hardware and/or security systems designed 
according to the principle of defence in depth and the physical protection system functions of 
“detection, delay and response”. 
This section includes security requirements for the following measures: 
 
access control 
 
detection of unauthorized access 
 
locking hardware and key control 
 
physical barriers (secure containers, secure enclosures) 
 
alarm response protocols 
 
inspection, maintenance and testing of physical security-related equipment 
 
security officers 
Within each of the areas identified above, the licensee shall define appropriate security measures 
that are commensurate with the level of risk presented by the sealed source(s). Further details are 
provided in sections 3.2.1 to 3.2.7. 
Pursuant to paragraphs 3(1)(g) and 3(1)(h) of the GNSCR, the licensee shall include in their 
application the proposed measures respecting control of access to the site of the licensed activity, 
as well as the proposed measures to prevent the loss or illegal use, possession or removal of the 
licensed materials. 
3.2.1 
Access control 
The licensee shall implement access control measures (e.g., access card readers, personnel 
identification systems, manual or electronic locks) or use security officers to ensure that only 
authorized persons have access to storage areas containing sealed sources at all times. 
Visitors, building maintenance staff, servicing companies, students and contractors who require 
access to the sealed source storage shall be escorted at all times if they do not possess a 
trustworthiness verification approved by the licensee. 
Guidance 
To control access to the sealed sources, the licensee should consider the following measures, 
based on a graded approach: 
 
monitor and maintain records of all personnel with access to secure storage areas, through the 
use of a log book or an access control system with tracking capabilities 
September 2020 
REGDOC-2.12.3, Security of Nuclear Substances: 
 
Sealed Sources and Category I, II and III Nuclear Material, Version 2.1 
 
14 
 
 
implement effective access control measures such as manually activated locking devices, 
padlocks, card reader access, biometric devices/systems, and “controlled” entry points 
 
ensure the access control system incorporates measures to prevent unacceptable practices such 
as “pass back” or “tailgating” 
 
assign individual personal identification number (PIN) codes if used in conjunction with an 
access control system 
 
remove access rights for individuals as soon as access is no longer required 
 
restrict access rights to the access control management system and software, to prevent 
unauthorized interference with the system database (hacking, software sabotage) 
 
implement a means of duress signalling near the source storage, to provide notice to the alarm 
monitoring company or response personnel 
 
implement a local alarm that triggers in the vicinity of the storage area, to alert nearby 
personnel of an intrusion or other problem in the source storage area 
The concept of escorting an individual at all times means maintaining line of sight with this 
individual. 
3.2.2 
Detection of unauthorized access 
The licensee shall implement measures for the detection of attempted or actual unauthorized 
access in a timely manner; for example: 
 
visual observation 
 
video alarm assessment 
 
detection devices 
 
accountancy records, seals, or other tamper-indicating devices including process monitoring 
systems 
Note that, for mobile sources in use, continuous visual surveillance by operator personnel 
equipped with an appropriate communication link may substitute for one or both layers of 
barriers. 
If an intrusion detection system is used, it must: 
 
immediately detect any unauthorized intrusion into the sealed source storage area 
 
immediately detect any tampering that may cause any of the alarm system devices to 
malfunction or cease to function 
 
when an intrusion is detected, set off a continuous alarm signal that is both audible and visible 
at the licensee’s location and/or at an approved monitoring station, using a supervised 
communications link 
 
include an uninterruptible power supply, subject to routine testing, to ensure continuous 
operability of the security detection system 
Guidance 
To detect unauthorized access, failure or tampering, the alarm system should: 
 
activate immediately upon detecting an intrusion or tamper event 
 
stay in an alarmed state until acknowledged by an authorized person 
 
use more than one sensor or sensor type in order to provide redundancy 
 
include overlapping sensor detection areas 
September 2020 
REGDOC-2.12.3, Security of Nuclear Substances: 
 
Sealed Sources and Category I, II and III Nuclear Material, Version 2.1 
 
15 
 
 
use dedicated supervised communication links that are continually monitored 
 
have dedicated alarm zones for each area of storage 
 
have a low nuisance and false alarm rate with a high probability of detection 
For licensees who contract their alarm monitoring to third-party companies, the licensee should 
ensure that the monitoring company is certified by the Underwriters Laboratories (UL) or 
Underwriters Laboratories of Canada (ULC), or other certification body deemed acceptable by 
CNSC staff. 
3.2.3 
Locking hardware and key control 
Access cards, door keys, or locks that control access to storage areas shall be restricted to 
personnel authorized by the licensee. 
The licensee shall maintain records of all access control authorizations, including locking devices 
(either electronic or manual). Such records shall include the names of the individuals to whom the 
locking devices or combinations have been issued, and the date of issuance. 
The licensee shall develop and maintain written procedures that include measures for issuing, 
repairing or replacing a locking device, key, access card or combination that is defective, lost, 
stolen, or unlawfully transferred, or has otherwise become compromised. 
Guidance 
If keys are used, the licensee should implement a key control policy to: 
 
restrict the number of individuals with keys 
 
restrict the number of master keys 
 
prohibit employees from duplicating keys 
 
use a patented key or dedicated keyway to prevent unauthorized duplication of keys 
 
include a provision for employees to return keys when access is no longer required 
 
ensure that key blanks are stored securely 
For key control, the licensee should: 
 
conduct a review of the key inventory and keyholders on a regular basis 
 
note changes and additions to the key inventory and keyholders in their records 
 
maintain accountability for all keys that have been issued and keys reported lost or stolen 
Locks with combination codes or cipher-based keyless locks are not recommended. 
When conventional locks and keys are used, they should be of high quality or from a high- 
security lock series. Key management procedures should be designed to prevent unauthorized 
access or compromise. The locks should have shielded shackles, to prevent cutting of the lock. 
3.2.4 
Physical barriers 
For sealed sources whose activity is less than the threshold levels listed for Category 3 in Table 1, 
the licensee shall store the sources in secure containers as described in this section. 
For sealed sources whose activity is equal to or above the threshold levels listed for Categories 1, 
2, or 3 in Table 1, the licensee shall implement a minimum of two different physical barriers, to 
September 2020 
REGDOC-2.12.3, Security of Nuclear Substances: 
 
Sealed Sources and Category I, II and III Nuclear Material, Version 2.1 
 
16 
 
prevent unauthorized access to sealed sources in storage and provide delay sufficient to enable 
response personnel to intervene as required. 
The physical barriers shall be any combination of secure containers or other secure enclosures. For 
example: 
 
a licensee who stores a sealed source in a locked safe may locate the safe in an enclosed room 
that can be locked, and must secure the container in place (floor, wall or vehicle) 
 
alternatively, the safe may be located within a locked metal cage or other suitable enclosure 
 
the access-controlled perimeter of the licensee’s location may serve as the first secure 
enclosure, with a secondary secure enclosure or secure container inside, both with access 
control 
Note that for a mobile source in use, it may not always be possible to achieve the security 
measures specified above. In such cases, compensatory measures shall be implemented to provide 
other forms of protection (e.g., close supervision combined with an appropriate communication 
link). 
Note that sealed sources stored in pools may have safety features inherent to their design that may 
substitute for one or both layers of physical barriers. 
Secure containers  
Secure containers include items such as secure filing cabinets, metal boxes, safes, vaults and wire 
mesh cages. For a container to be considered secure, it must be: 
 
securely affixed in place 
 
resistant to physical attack using handheld tools 
 
fitted with a key or combination padlock, or similar lock, that can resist surreptitious or forced 
attack using handheld tools 
 
when a wire mesh cage is used, the cage fabric must be expandable metal mesh no smaller 
than number 10 gauge [6] 
Note that sealed sources stored inside containers weighing over 500 kg may be considered secure 
due to their weight and robustness. Equivalent containers or structures that have a comparable 
level of security may be acceptable. 
Secure enclosures 
Enclosures include rooms, buildings or cages that can be secured. For an enclosure to be 
considered secure, all exterior components (e.g., walls, doors and windows) are resistant to 
physical attack using handheld tools and access/egress points are equipped with access control 
devices, or access is controlled by security officers. 
Windows that provide access to interior areas in proximity to sources must be equipped with bars 
(where the gap between the bars must be less than 15 cm), metal grill, expanded metal mesh, 
and/or retrofitted with a UL/ULC certified security film or glazing. Security hardware attached to 
windows must be affixed from the inside to prevent tampering, or fitted with tamper-resistant 
devices if fitted from the outside. 
September 2020

Sealed Sources and Category I, II and III Nuclear Material, Version 2.1 
 
17 
 
Doors that provide access to areas where radioactive sources are used, processed or stored must 
be secured when left unattended. Doors must be solid-core wood or metal clad and installed in a 
reinforced frame of equivalent material. Doors must be maintained in good state of repair and 
fitted with non-removable pinned hinges, if the hinges are mounted on the outside. Any door 
glazing or large vents (grills) must be fitted with security glazing or bars, metal grills, or 
equivalent. Grills must be secured in place with tamper-resistant devices. 
For situations where radioactive sources are used or stored in proximity to explosives, a minimum 
separation of 3 metres must be maintained between the radioactive sources and all explosive 
material, as required in section 13 of the Guidelines for Jet Perforating Gun Assembly Facilities 
[7]. 
Guidance 
Traditional barriers such as chain-link fences, locked doors, grilled windows, masonry walls and 
vaults are commonly used for storage of sealed sources. Barriers should be considered in relation 
to an adversary’s objectives. 
The licensee should implement multiple physical barriers to protect the radioactive sources. 
Multiple barriers potentially force an adversary to bring a variety of tools to defeat each 
individual barrier, thereby delaying the adversary and providing the response personnel with time 
to intervene. One implementation of the concept of defence in depth is to have multiple layers of 
different barrier types along the path to complicate an adversary’s progress by requiring a variety 
of tools and skills (see figure 1).

REGDOC-2.12.3, Security of Nuclear Substances: 
 
Sealed Sources and Category I, II and III Nuclear Material, Version 2.1 
 
18 
 
For example, multiple barriers may include: 
 
a portable device (e.g., portable gauge, exposure device) stored inside a vault or safe that is 
bolted to the floor and capable of resisting common attack tools 
 
a mobile device (e.g., a brachytherapy unit) that may be chained to the floor within the storage 
area. The chain is made of material that is resistant to common attack tools and is secured with 
a high-quality padlock that has the same level of robustness (e.g., shielded shackles) 
 
a solid-core door made of wood or metal, installed with non-removable screws, pinned door 
hinges, a latch protector and an automatic door closer 
 
a window equipped with laminated window-film resistant to burglar attacks, metal mesh or 
metal bars spaced at 15 centimetres or less, and installed with non-removable screws 
Guidance for secure containers 
The storage location and/or container should: 
 
be secured with a locking mechanism or have other measures to prevent unauthorized removal 
 
be secured when left unattended 
 
be equipped with an alarm system to detect unauthorized entry or access 
 
be sufficiently robust to resist common attack tools (e.g., crowbar, drill, blowtorch) 
Guidance for secure enclosures 
Openings, such as windows or vent ducts, that could provide access to secure enclosures should 
be fitted with bars, a metal grill, expanded metal mesh, and/or retrofitted with a UL/ULC certified 
security film or glazing. Security hardware attached to windows should be affixed from the 
inside, to prevent tampering, or be fitted with tamper-resistant anchors if affixed from the outside. 
Doors that provide access to areas where sealed sources and/or radiation devices are used, 
processed or stored should be secured when unattended. The material used for the door should be 
solid-core wood or metal-clad, and the door should be installed in a reinforced frame of 
equivalent material. Doors should be in a good state of repair. If the hinges are mounted on the 
non-secure side, the door should be fitted with non-removable pinned hinges. Any door glazing or 
large vents (grills) should be fitted with security glazing or bars, a metal grill, or equivalent. 
Grills should be secured in place with tamper-resistant anchors. 
If continuous visual surveillance is done by an operator, the operator should be equipped with a 
means of communication (e.g., cell phone or radio) and should be aware of the response protocols 
to communicate rapidly to response personnel in the event of unauthorized access or removal. 
If key pads are used to arm and disarm an intrusion detection system, the device and its electric 
junction box should be installed in a secure area, to reduce the risk of tampering. 
To maintain continuous power to the alarm monitoring detection system in the event of a loss of 
primary power, the licensee should consider implementing an alternate or auxiliary power back-
up source, or equivalent, to maintain detection capability.

September 2020 
REGDOC-2.12.3, Security of Nuclear Substances: 
 
Sealed Sources and Category I, II and III Nuclear Material, Version 2.1 
 
22 
 
information to perform job duties, but who are not approved by the licensee, must be escorted by 
an approved individual. The nature and depth of personnel screening practices [9] shall be based 
on the category of the radioactive material. 
For Category 1, 2 and 3 sources, the licensee shall, at a minimum, verify the following 
information: 
1. confirm the identity of personnel from reliable original documentation such as passport or 
combination of other original documents with photo ID (e.g., valid driver’s licence , health 
card or birth certificate) 
2. a record emanating from the Canadian Police Information Center or from a police service, 
showing the result of a criminal records name check (CRNC) on the person 
3. the person’s employment history, including their educational achievement, and professional 
qualifications, unless the person has been employed for more than five years at the facility 
4. if a person’s history cannot be established for at least the last five years, information relating 
to the trustworthiness of the person including, where available, a CRNC from each country in 
which the person has resided for one or more years in the last five years 
The trustworthiness and reliability verification shall be updated on a regular basis; at a minimum, 
every five years. 
The licensee is responsible for retaining documentation regarding trustworthiness and reliability 
for the period ending one year after the expiry of the licence in accordance with subsection 28(1) 
of the GNSCR. The licensee must permit the CNSC to have access to the trustworthiness and 
reliability records for review, inspection, or audit purposes. 
Alternative to a criminal records name check 
If an individual holds one of the following documents or permits, that individual may be exempted 
from the CRNC as these are considered to be equivalent alternatives: 
 
Natural Resources Canada (NRCan) Explosive Regulatory Division security screening letter 
 
Free and Secure Trade Card (FAST) issued by Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) 
 
NEXUS Card issued by CBSA 
 
Firearm Possession and Acquisition Licence (PAL) issued under the Firearms Act, S.C. 1995, 
C.39 
 
Permis Général issued under the Québec Explosive Act, R.S.Q. E-22 
 
a security assessment under the Controlled Goods Program administered by the Controlled 
Goods Directorate of the Department of Public Works and Government Services Canada 
When the individual provides current valid proof of one of these documents or permits to the 
licensee/employer, the licensee/employer may grant unescorted access to high-risk sealed sources 
without conducting a CRNC. 
Guidance 
The licensee’s trustworthiness verification program should ensure individuals who have 
unescorted access to high-risk sealed sources are trustworthy and reliable, and do not pose an 
unreasonable risk to the health and safety of persons and security. The licensee should maintain 
copies of all documents provided by applicants and ensure they have been verified as original. The 
trustworthiness verification program should be reviewed on a regular basis. 
September 2020 
REGDOC-2.12.3, Security of Nuclear Substances: 
 
Sealed Sources and Category I, II and III Nuclear Material, Version 2.1 
 
23 
 
The trustworthiness verification program should apply to: 
 
individuals with unescorted access to Category 1, 2 and 3 sources 
 
vehicle drivers and those accompanying the transport of Category 1 sources 
 
any individual whose assigned duties provide access to prescribed and/or sensitive 
information or the handling of Category 1 sources (including onsite security officers) 
The trustworthiness verification program identifies past actions to help determine an individual’s 
past and current character and reputation in order to provide reasonable assurance of that 
individual’s future reliability. Some indicators that licensees may consider while verifying 
trustworthiness and reliability include: 
 
conviction for a serious crime within the past five years (including murder, attempted murder, 
or indictable offences involving violence) 
 
impaired performance or dangerous behaviour attributable to psychological or other disorders 
 
misconduct that warrants criminal investigations or results in arrest or conviction 
 
indication of deceitful or delinquent behaviour 
 
attempted or threatened destruction of life or property 
 
illegal drug use, abuse or distribution 
 
alcohol abuse disorders 
 
failure to comply with work directives 
 
hostility or aggression toward fellow workers or authority 
 
uncontrolled anger 
 
violation of safety or security procedures 
Note that these indicators are not all-inclusive and they are not intended to be disqualifying 
factors. Licensees should consider extenuating or mitigating factors. For additional guidance, refer 
to Appendix B for a process chart of the steps for assessing a person’s criminal record. 
In cases where: 
 
gaps exist in the documentation, or CRNC results show either “records match” or 
“incomplete”, the licensee should inform the applicant, and ensure the information is 
completed and/or accurate 
 
gaps exist in the individual’s history (residence or employment), the licensee should contact 
the applicant to retrieve all necessary information, and meet with the applicant to clarify any 
concerns 
 
it is not possible to obtain background information to cover the last five years, or if significant 
adverse information arises during the process of the trustworthiness and reliability 
verification, the licensee should notify the individual in person and give them the opportunity 
to provide clarifications or explanations 
 
there are indictable convictions, the licensee should conduct a security interview 
 
the criteria used to decide whether a security interview is necessary should include 
assessing the risk to the high-risk radioactive source(s) or site security 
 
the decision to grant, deny or revoke unescorted access to the radioactive material rests 
with the licensee; the decision should be supported by a management policy that includes 
a risk-based decision-making process 
 
CRNC information is unavailable or incomplete, or an indictable conviction exists, 
fingerprints should be verified through a police service agency (in the area of jurisdiction 
where the person has resided) or by a trusted third party

3.3.4 
Protection of prescribed and/or sensitive information 
The licensee shall provide protection measures to control access to prescribed information, 
pursuant to sections 21 to 23 of the GNSCR, and to prevent loss, illegal use, illegal possession or 
illegal removal of such prescribed information. This information shall be managed on a “need to 
know” basis. 
Guidance 
“Prescribed information” is defined in the GNSCR, section 21 (see glossary). 
The following information is considered to be examples of prescribed information: 
 
the facility security plan, correspondence related to security, security response measures, 
contingency plans and transport security plan, if applicable 
 
the specific location and inventory of sources, installation schematics and security systems 
including performance testing 
 
threat and risk assessment and/or vulnerability assessment 
Prescribed and/or sensitive information should be: 
 
protected from unauthorized disclosure and secure when left unattended 
 
disclosed only to individuals on a “need to know” basis to perform their assigned duties 
 
stored in a manner that prevents removal or theft 
Highly sensitive documents should be stored on a hard medium (diskette, CD-ROM or USB key) 
or in paper format only, and kept in a secure location that is accessible only to individuals with a 
“need to know”. This information should not be stored on an open or shared network without 
proper protection. 
For prescribed and/or sensitive information, the licensee should: 
 
use “portable” storage devices (i.e., computer, external hard drive, USB keys) that can be 
removed and secured 
 
use storage devices that are “protected” via passwords or encryption, and are only accessible 
to authorized users via approved cyber security protocols 
 
protect the confidentiality, availability and integrity of information or documents containing 
prescribed information 
For transportation and transmission of prescribed and/or sensitive information: 
 
the top right-hand corner of each page of the document should include the security 
classification level in bold, upper-case letters (i.e., “PRESCRIBED INFORMATION”) 
 
the document and the related correspondence may be forwarded to the CNSC by mail, courier, 
or “secure facsimile” 
 
electronic transmission (e.g., email) of this information is not acceptable, unless it is 
encrypted using proper technologies

Prescribed information and documents containing sensitive information that is obsolete or no 
longer relevant should be shredded or destroyed in accordance with the security rating of the 
material designated for destruction. 
3.3.5 
Inventory control 
The licensee shall conduct regular inventory checks for detection purposes, to verify that the 
source(s) are secure and have not been altered or subject to illegal access or unauthorized removal. 
These inventory checks shall comply with paragraph 36(1)(a) of the NSRDR. 
Guidance 
The licensee should establish and maintain a list of sealed sources under their responsibility. 
Inventory verification can be used as part of detection measures. Regular inventory checking 
should consist of measures to ensure that the sources are present and have not been tampered with. 
Such measures could include physical checks that the source is in place, verification during onsite 
movement or transfer, remote observation through closed circuit television (CCTV), or 
verification of seals or other tamper devices on storage containers and facilities. A process for 
inventory control should be in place, to ensure a robust verification process.  
4. Security Measures for Sealed Sources during Transport 
4.1 Vehicle security 
For the transport of a Category 1 source, the vehicle shall be equipped with: 
 
a vehicle tracking device that enables the vehicle to be recovered if stolen.  
 
a duress alarm or an equivalent device that is continuously monitored; the licensee shall 
instruct the alarm monitoring station to alert the appropriate response force (e.g., local law 
enforcement agency) 
For Category 1, 2 and 3 sources, the licensee’s vehicles shall be equipped with anti-theft devices. 
The anti-theft devices shall consist of: 
 
a vehicle disabling device (e.g., starter disabler that prevents the start of the vehicle without a 
proper key or a similar start device) 
 
if the vehicle is left unattended, a device that immediately detects unauthorized entry or attack 
to the vehicle and triggers an audible or visible alarm. If the vehicle operator is not within 
hearing or visual range of the alarm, the operator shall have the ability to monitor the alarm 
devices remotely 
These anti-theft devices shall be activated automatically or manually by the operator at any time 
when the vehicle containing the package is left unattended. 
While being stored during transportation, the package shall either be stored in a secure container 
in the vehicle, or in a location that is protected by physical security measures and is continuously 
monitored when the package is left unattended. 
For Category 4 and 5 sources, the licensee shall implement prudent management practices by 
using effective access control and ensuring the security of radioactive material and devices at all 
times.  
September 2020 
REGDOC-2.12.3, Security of Nuclear Substances: 
 
Sealed Sources and Category I, II and III Nuclear Material, Version 2.1 
 
26 
 
Guidance 
If a licensee’s transport vehicle is left unattended while transporting Category 1, 2 and 3 sources, 
the licensee should have a means to immediately detect, assess and respond to actual or attempted 
theft or diversion of the sealed sources. An alarm system is an acceptable method. Examples of 
acceptable vehicle disabling devices that provide effective delay include trailer hitch locks, wheel 
locks (“boots”), or a method to disable the engine. 
The licensee should ensure a secondary means to protect the vehicle, including a securing 
mechanism having a similar attack resistance (e.g., chain, locks, and seals). 
4.2 Security measures for sealed sources during transport 
As the licensee (the consignor) is responsible for the safety and security of sealed sources during 
transport, the licensee shall ensure the authorized carrier is capable of providing physical security 
measures for sealed sources while they are in transport or being stored during transportation. 
As required by the PTNSR 2015, the licensee shall provide the carrier with the appropriate 
shipping documents relating to the sealed source. The shipping documents shall include a 
statement regarding the actions, if any, to be taken by the carrier, and shall also include a 
description of the security measures for sealed sources. Where more than one category of sources 
is included in the consignment, the applicable measures shall be based on the more restrictive 
category. 
All packages containing sealed sources of Category 1, 2 or 3 shall be protected from unauthorized 
access, theft or unauthorized removal during transport and temporary storage during transport. The 
consignee should be notified when, where and by whom such packages are being moved, 
including tracking numbers and expected arrival times. The licensee, being the consignor, shall 
contract a carrier with a proven record for the safety and security of dangerous goods while in 
transport, and shall take the following precautions: 
1) The package containing the sealed source shall be stored in a secure container. Packages over 
500 kg are considered secure due to the handling difficulties caused by their weight. The 
secure container does not replace any other packaging or labelling required by any existing 
regulations. A secure container: 
a) shall be made of steel or any other material that is resistant to a physical attack by 
handheld tools 
b) shall be equipped with a key, combination padlock or similar locking device that is 
resistant to an attack using handheld tools 
c) if transported in an open conveyance (e.g., open back of a half-ton truck, flatbed truck), it 
shall be securely affixed to the vehicle to prevent unauthorized removal of the container 
d) if containing a sealed source with an activity level less than Category 3 (see Table 1), may 
be stored in the securely locked trunk or other cargo area of a vehicle while in storage and 
during transportation 
2) During a stopover while being transported, the package shall either be stored in a secure 
container in the vehicle (as described in list item 1, above), or in a location that is protected by 
physical security measures (as described in section 3). 
3) The vehicle operator shall have on his or her person, at all times, a reliable mobile 
communication capability (e.g., cell phone) and a list of contact persons and their contact 
numbers in the event of an emergency situation. 
September 2020 
REGDOC-2.12.3, Security of Nuclear Substances: 
 
Sealed Sources and Category I, II and III Nuclear Material, Version 2.1 
 
27 
 
Alternate methodologies that provide a level of physical security equivalent to that described 
above may be submitted to the CNSC for review, or identified in a licence application or a request 
to amend a licence. 
For transport of Category 1 or 2 sources and devices, the licensee shall verify that the carrier: 
 
uses a package tracking system  
 
implements methods to ensure trustworthiness and reliability of drivers  
 
establishes constant control and/or surveillance during transit  
 
has the capability for immediate communication to summon appropriate response or 
assistance 
For transport of Category 3 sources, the licensee shall verify that the carrier: 
 
implements methods to ensure trustworthiness and reliability of drivers  
 
maintains constant control and/or surveillance during transit 
 
has the capability for immediate communication to summon appropriate response or 
assistance 
For transport of Category 4 and 5 sources, the licensee shall implement prudent management 
practices by using effective access control and ensuring the security of radioactive material and 
devices at all times. 
Guidance 
Security awareness training should be provided to all individuals engaged in the handling or 
transport of sealed sources, including refresher training when required.  
Before transporting Category 1 and 2 sources, all of the carrier’s employees who are involved in 
transporting the sealed sources should have successfully completed security screening for 
trustworthiness and reliability. 
The security awareness training should include the items listed for the transport security plan (see 
section 4.3) and specific information on: 
 
the identified threats for the conveyance 
 
security concerns and actions to be undertaken in the event of a security incident during 
transport 
Security devices on the transport vehicles should: 
 
be inspected regularly for any signs of tampering or deterioration that may adversely affect 
their designated function.  
 
be tested at least every six months.  
 
be inspected by an authorized person to ensure integrity of the security mechanism on the 
vehicle used to transport Category 1 or 2 sources 
For sources in use or in transit, such measures may include: a secured/fixed container, or 
placement of the source container inside a secured storage area (e.g., container chained or bolted 
to the vehicle). For mobile sources in use, continuous visual surveillance may be a substitute for 
one or two physical barriers. If a sealed source is temporarily stored while in transit (for example, 
September 2020 
REGDOC-2.12.3, Security of Nuclear Substances: 
 
Sealed Sources and Category I, II and III Nuclear Material, Version 2.1 
 
28 
 
in a warehouse), equivalent security measures should be applied that are consistent with those 
security measures discussed above for storage of Category 1 and 2 sources. 
If packages are transported on an open conveyance, the packages should be secured to the vehicle 
for safety and security purposes.

behavioural changes in all personnel, including contractors, that could pose a risk to security at a 
facility at which it carries on licensed activities.  
7. Transport Security Measures 
This section provides guidance that applicants for a licence to transport Category I, II or III 
nuclear material may use when developing a transportation security plan under section 5 of the 
NSR. The following measures derive from regulatory requirements, national practices and 
international arrangements, and apply to all or specific categories of nuclear material, as indicated 
by the respective headings. 
7.1 Measures for all categories of nuclear material 
7.1.1 
International protocols 
Canada is a party to the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material 
(2005 Amendment), developed under the auspices of the International Atomic Energy Agency 
(IAEA). The convention calls upon parties to cooperate in providing protection of nuclear 
material during its transport across national borders. Parties are to apply protocols in concurrence 
with IAEA Nuclear Security Series No. 13 – Nuclear Security Recommendations on Physical 
Protection of Nuclear Material and Nuclear Facilities (INFCIRC/225/Revision 5). 
Before nuclear material is transported internationally, the shipper should ensure that the transport 
arrangements are in accordance with the physical protection regulations of the receiving country, 
and of any other countries through which the shipment is to pass. The nuclear regulatory agencies 
in the countries involved should be aware of the planned transport of nuclear material across a 
national border, and should be in agreement as to who will be responsible for the shipment at the 
various stages. The shipper and the receiver of the nuclear material that is to be transported across 
a national border should have an agreement that clearly states the point at which the responsibility 
for physical protection of the shipment transfers from the shipper to the receiver. 
As long as material is within the borders of a country, it is subject to the regulatory regime of that 
country. For example, in the case of shipments between Canada and the United States, 
responsibility for physical protection begins and ends at the border between the two countries. 
This means that a shipment entering Canada from the United States becomes the responsibility of 
the CNSC licensee as soon as it enters Canada. Accordingly, if the nuclear material is to be 
imported into Canada, or exported from Canada, the receiver, or the shipper, respectively, must 
obtain from the CNSC, before the shipment crosses the border, the appropriate transport licence, 
along with an import licence in the former case, and an export licence in the latter. 
Where a shipment of nuclear material might pass through the territory, including the territorial 
waters and airspace, of more than two countries, the sending and receiving countries should 
include the other countries in their arrangements in order to enlist their cooperation in assuring 
adequate physical protection of the shipment. 
7.1.2 
Other principles 
Since nuclear material can be especially vulnerable to theft or acts of sabotage when being 
transported, licensees should provide to nuclear material that is in transport a level of physical 
protection comparable to that provided for similar material during use or storage. 
September 2020 
REGDOC-2.12.3, Security of Nuclear Substances: 
 
Sealed Sources and Category I, II and III Nuclear Material, Version 2.1 
 
41 
 
The total time that the nuclear material remains in transport should be minimized. The number 
and duration of any transfers of the nuclear material from one conveyance vehicle to another, or 
to and from temporary or longer-term storage, should also be minimized. 
Fixed transport schedules for the movement of the nuclear material should be avoided. The routes 
used to transport the nuclear material should be varied, taking into account applicable regulations 
and ordinances regarding transport routes for radioactive and hazardous materials. Data about the 
movement of the nuclear material should be restricted to authorized persons. 
Preliminary arrangements for the shipment of the nuclear material should be made with the 
receiver before the material is shipped, and details such as mode of transport, the handover point 
and the arrival time should be subsequently confirmed. 
The trustworthiness of everyone who is to be involved in the transport of the nuclear material 
should be verified in advance of shipment, in accordance with the licensee’s established 
procedures. 
Where warranted, a transport security control centre (or security monitoring room (SMR), where 
applicable) should be established to coordinate the transport of the nuclear material and to make 
sure that secure and reliable communications are in place at all times during the transport of the 
nuclear material.  
7.2 Category-specific measures 
7.2.1 
Measures for the transport of Category I nuclear material 
Escorts 
Shipments of Category I nuclear material should be accompanied by armed guards, or 
continuously escorted by a vehicle containing armed guards. The guards should maintain routine 
communications with the shipper, the receiver, the local authorities and the response forces along 
the transport route, until such time as responsibility for the shipment has been transferred to the 
receiver. 
Communications 
The shipper of Category I nuclear material should, in advance of the planned shipment, inform 
the receiver of the characteristics of the nuclear material, its planned modes of transport, and its 
anticipated date, time and location of arrival. 
Before the transport begins, the shipper should confirm that the receiver is willing and prepared to 
receive the shipment. Upon the arrival of the shipment, the receiver should immediately notify the 
shipper. If the shipment does not arrive at its intended destination after an interval agreed to in 
advance by the shipper and the receiver, the receiver should immediately notify the shipper of the 
incident. 
Reliable and secure communications are essential during the transport of Category I nuclear 
material. Communications by two-way radio concerning the transport of such nuclear material 
should consist of encrypted messages only. During the transport, the escort should remain in 
frequent contact with the shipper, the receiver, the local authorities and the response forces along 
the transport route. When planning for the shipment, the shipper should establish a plan of action 
September 2020 
REGDOC-2.12.3, Security of Nuclear Substances: 
 
Sealed Sources and Category I, II and III Nuclear Material, Version 2.1 
 
42 
 
in the event that communications are lost during shipment. The establishment of a transport 
security control centre (or SMR, where applicable) should be considered. 
If a shipment of nuclear material is lost or stolen, the licensee must, pursuant to paragraph 27(b) 
of the NSCA and paragraph 29(1)(a) of the GNSCR, immediately make a preliminary report to 
the CNSC of the location and circumstances of the situation and of any action that the licensee 
has taken or proposes to take with respect to the situation. 
Locks and seals 
Packages that contain Category I nuclear material should be transported in closed, locked and 
sealed vehicles or freight containers. Where necessary, packages that contain Category I nuclear 
material and weigh more than 2,000 kg may, if locked, sealed and secured to the vehicle or 
freight container, be transported on an open vehicle. The integrity of the package locks and seals 
should be checked before departure, during the journey and on arrival at the final destination, in 
order to detect, in a timely manner, any tampering. 
Security measures 
All shipments of Category I nuclear material should be made, regardless of the mode of transport, 
in vehicles that are dedicated solely to the transport of such material. 
Before shipping the nuclear material, the shipper should ensure that the selected carrier is aware 
of, and can comply with, the required physical security measures. When dealing with third-party 
carriers, the shipper should emphasize to the carrier the need for confidentiality in matters 
concerning shipments of Category I nuclear material and the need for the carrier to assure that 
everyone under the carrier’s control who is to be involved in the planned transport of nuclear 
material is trustworthy. 
Before a vehicle is loaded with a shipment of Category I nuclear material, appropriately trained 
personnel should conduct a rigorous search of the vehicle to ensure that there has been no attempt 
to sabotage it. Immediately following completion of the security search of the vehicle, it should 
be closed, locked, sealed and placed in a secure area pending its loading for transport. 
Transport by road 
Any vehicle that is to be used to transport Category I nuclear material by road should be manned 
and loaded so as to deter sabotage or theft of the cargo during transport. The driver of the 
transport vehicle should be accompanied by an armed guard, and the transport vehicle itself 
should be escorted by a separate vehicle carrying a driver and one or more armed guards. The 
escort vehicle should maintain constant surveillance of the shipment. The cargo should be firmly 
secured to the transport vehicle. 
Transport by rail 
During transport by rail, Category I nuclear material should be carried in a freight car of a railway 
train dedicated to the transport of freight. The car should be locked and sealed. Two or more 
guards should maintain constant surveillance of the car containing the nuclear material by 
travelling in an adjoining car. At regular intervals, the guards should check the integrity of the 
locks and seals of the freight car.

Transport by ship 
During transport by ship, Category I nuclear material should be carried in a locked and sealed 
freight container that is securely loaded onto a vessel dedicated to the transport of cargo. Two or 
more guards should accompany the shipment and maintain constant surveillance of it. At regular 
intervals, the guards should check the integrity of the locks and seals of the freight container. 
Transport by air 
During transport by air, Category I nuclear material should be carried in a locked and sealed 
freight container that is placed on a chartered aircraft dedicated to the transport of cargo. Two or 
more guards should accompany the shipment and maintain constant surveillance of it. At regular 
intervals, the guards should check the integrity of the locks and seals of the freight container. 
7.2.2 
Measures for the transport of Category II nuclear materials 
Escorts 
Shipments of Category II nuclear material should be accompanied by one or more escorts, such as 
nuclear security guards authorized pursuant to section 18(2) of the NSR. These escorts should 
maintain constant surveillance of the shipment by travelling in the cargo vehicle or in an 
accompanying vehicle. 
Communications 
The shipper of Category II nuclear material should, in advance of the planned shipment, inform 
the receiver of the characteristics of the nuclear material, its planned modes of transport, and its 
anticipated date, time and location of arrival. 
Before the transport begins, the shipper should confirm that the receiver is willing and prepared to 
receive the shipment. Upon the arrival of the shipment, the receiver should immediately notify the 
shipper of the arrival. If the shipment does not arrive at its intended destination after an interval 
agreed to in advance by the shipper and the receiver, the receiver should immediately notify the 
shipper of the incident. 
During the transport of Category II nuclear material, the escort should remain in frequent contact 
with the shipper, the receiver, the local authorities and the response forces along the transport 
route. When planning for the shipment, the shipper should establish a plan of action in the event 
that communications are lost during shipment. The establishment of a transport security control 
centre (or SMR, where applicable) should be considered. 
If a shipment of nuclear material is lost or stolen, the licensee must, pursuant to paragraph 27(b) 
of the NSCA and paragraph 29(1)(a) of the GNSCR, immediately make a preliminary report to 
the CNSC of the location and circumstances of the situation and of any action that the licensee 
has taken or proposes to take with respect to the situation. 
Locks and seals 
Packages that contain Category II nuclear material should be transported in closed, locked and 
sealed vehicles or freight containers. Where necessary, packages that contain Category II nuclear 
material and weigh more than 2,000 kg may, if locked, sealed and secured to the vehicle or 
freight container, be transported on an open vehicle. The integrity of the package locks and seals 
September 2020

44 
 
should be checked before departure, during the journey and on arrival at the final destination, in 
order to detect, in a timely manner, any tampering. 
Security measures 
Before shipping Category II nuclear material, the shipper should ensure that the selected carrier is 
aware of, and can comply with, the required physical security measures. When dealing with third-
party carriers, the shipper should emphasize to the carrier the need for confidentiality in matters 
concerning the shipments of Category II nuclear material and the need for the carrier to assure 
that everyone under the carrier’s control who is to be involved in the planned transport of nuclear 
material is trustworthy. 
The number of cargo transfers during the shipment of Category II nuclear material and the length 
of time the shipment is in active transport, should be minimized. 
Transport by road 
Before a vehicle is loaded with a shipment of Category II nuclear material, qualified personnel 
should conduct a rigorous security search of the vehicle to ensure that there has been no attempt 
to sabotage it. Immediately following completion of the security search of the vehicle, it should 
be placed in a secure area pending its loading for transport. The transport vehicle, once loaded 
with Category II material for transport and in transit, should be locked and sealed when not on the 
move, and should never be left unattended. 
Transport by rail 
During transport by rail, Category II nuclear material should be carried in a car of a train 
dedicated to the transport of freight, or in a dedicated freight car attached to a passenger train. 
The car should be locked and sealed. 
Transport by ship 
During transport by ship, Category II nuclear material should be carried in a locked and sealed 
freight container. 
Transport by air 
During transport by air, Category II nuclear material should be carried in a locked and sealed 
freight container that is placed on an aircraft dedicated to the transport of cargo. 
7.2.3 
Measures for the transport of Category III nuclear material 
Communications 
The shipper of Category III nuclear material should, in advance of the planned shipment, inform 
the receiver of the characteristics of the nuclear material, its planned modes of transport, and its 
anticipated date, time and location of arrival. 
Before the transport begins, the shipper should confirm that the receiver is willing and prepared to 
receive the shipment. Upon the arrival of the shipment, the receiver should immediately notify the 
shipper of the arrival. If the shipment does not arrive at its intended destination after an interval

agreed to in advance by the shipper and the receiver, the receiver should immediately notify the 
shipper of the incident. 
If a shipment of nuclear material is lost or stolen, the licensee must, pursuant to paragraph 27(b) 
of the NSCA and paragraph 29(1)(a) of the GNSCR, immediately make a preliminary report to 
the CNSC of the location and circumstances of the situation and of any action that the licensee 
has taken or proposes to take with respect to the situation. 
Locks and seals 
Packages that contain Category III nuclear material should be transported in closed, locked and 
sealed vehicles, or in locked and sealed freight containers, when feasible. 
Security measures 
Before shipping Category III nuclear material, the shipper should ensure that the selected carrier 
is aware of, and can comply with, the required physical security measures. When dealing with 
third-party carriers, the shipper should emphasize to the carrier the need for confidentiality in 
matters concerning the shipments of Category III nuclear material and the need for the carrier to 
assure that everyone under the carrier’s control who is to be involved in the planned transport of 
nuclear material is trustworthy.

8. Transportation Security Plan 
8.1 Content 
To comply with section 5 of the NSR, an application for a licence to transport Category I, II or III 
nuclear material shall include a written transportation security plan that contains the information 
required by paragraphs 5(a) to (h) of the same regulations. Guidance on the information that is to 
be included in the plan to meet these requirements is provided below. In addition, section 7 of this 
document recommends measures on protecting nuclear material during transport that the 
applicant may find useful when developing a transportation security plan. 
Guidance 
The primary purpose of a transportation security plan is to assure that the nuclear material to be 
transported will receive adequate physical protection against any threats that may arise during its 
transport. Accordingly, the security measures provided for in the proposed plan should be 
commensurate with the category of the nuclear material that is to be transported, and with the 
associated threats. That is, security measures for the transport of Category I nuclear material 
should typically be more stringent than for the transport of Category II nuclear material, and those 
for the transport of Category II nuclear material more stringent than for Category III nuclear 
material. 
When applying for a licence to transport Category I, II or III nuclear material, the applicant can 
expedite CNSC review and processing of the application by submitting a security transportation 
plan that follows appendix D of this document and that adopts the subject headings of sections 
8.1.1 to 8.1.8. 
Throughout the plan, applicants should, whenever possible, name the key persons involved, 
provide their position titles, and describe their associated roles, responsibilities, authorities and 
accountabilities. 
8.1.1 
Administrative information 
The administrative information should include: 
 
the complete legal name and business address of the applicant who is submitting the plan in 
support of a licence application pursuant to section 5 of the NSR 
 
the complete legal name and business address of any individual who is authorized to serve as 
the applicant’s representative in discussions with the CNSC concerning matters pertaining to 
the plan 
 
the telephone and fax numbers, or email addresses at which the applicant, or any 
representative of the applicant in matters pertaining to the plan, may be contacted during 
normal business hours 
 
a description of the licence application to which the plan pertains 
8.1.2 
Description of the nuclear material 
Pursuant to paragraph 5(a) of the NSR, the description of the nuclear material to be transported 
should include: 
 
the name of the nuclear material 
September 2020 
REGDOC-2.12.3, Security of Nuclear Substances: 
 
Sealed Sources and Category I, II and III Nuclear Material, Version 2.1 
 
47 
 
 
the category and quantity of the nuclear material (gross mass, net mass and mass of nuclear 
material) 
 
the chemical and physical characteristics of the nuclear material 
 
the isotopic composition of the nuclear material 
 
the degree of enrichment or dilution of uranium 235, uranium 233 or plutonium  
 
the radiation level, in Gy/h, of the overall shipment as well as that of its discrete parts 
8.1.3 
Threat assessment 
Pursuant to paragraph 5(b) of the NSR, a transportation security plan shall include “a threat 
assessment consisting of an evaluation of the nature, likelihood and consequences of acts or 
events that may place prescribed information or nuclear material at risk”. 
Guidance 
All credible threats to the security of the shipment should be identified. Threat assessments for 
Category I and II shipments should be considerably more thorough than those for Category III 
shipments. 
The CNSC expects that applicants, when evaluating threats to a proposed transport of Category I, 
II or III nuclear material, will communicate with their appropriate law enforcement agencies to 
determine whether these agencies consider the threats to be high, medium or low, and will factor 
the response received into the overall assessment. 
The CNSC receives, from the responsible federal security agencies, assessments that identify 
known criminal, extremist or terrorist threats that involve the movement of nuclear material. 
Thus, the applicant, when preparing the application for a licence to transport Category I, II or III 
nuclear material, should contact the CNSC to determine whether it is aware of any special 
information that should be taken into account in the applicant’s threat assessment. 
8.1.4 
Description of the conveyance 
Paragraph 5(c) of the NSR requires that the transportation security plan provide “a description of 
the conveyance” for the proposed transport. This description should cover the act of conveyance 
from the time the shipment leaves its originating location until it reaches its planned destination. 
It should describe how the nuclear material will be contained or secured for transport, including 
the type, design, size and weight of any container to be used and any provision for securing the 
container to the transport vehicle. 
If the proposed conveyance involves more than one mode of transport and multiple transfers of 
the nuclear material – for example, by road to a rail terminal, followed by rail transport for a 
further stage of the journey, and finally by road to the planned destination site – the details of the 
conveyance should be provided for each segment of the journey. These details should include the 
date, time and location of the planned transfers and the names of the persons to be responsible for 
ensuring the success of the transfers, and for verifying the integrity of the associated shipments. 
Where interim storage of the nuclear material may be required during conveyance, the proposed 
security measures for the conveyance should provide for safe interim storage of the materials, as 
discussed in section 8.1.5. 
September 2020 
REGDOC-2.12.3, Security of Nuclear Substances: 
 
Sealed Sources and Category I, II and III Nuclear Material, Version 2.1 
 
48 
 
Where interim storage of the nuclear material may be required during conveyance, the proposed 
security measures for the conveyance should provide for secure interim storage of both the 
vehicle and materials, as discussed in section 8.1.5. 
8.1.5 
Proposed security measures 
As required by paragraph 5(d) of the NSR, a description of the proposed security measures must 
be included in the transportation security plan. 
Guidance 
To provide adequate protection during a conveyance, the proposed security measures should be 
commensurate with the specific circumstances. These measures should take into account the 
category of nuclear material to be transported, the size and type of the shipment, the distance and 
type of terrain to be covered, the mode of transport, the results of the threat assessment, and 
public concerns. Accordingly, the proposed security measures should typically describe: 
 
whether the shipment of Category I, II or III nuclear material is to be sealed or unsealed 
 
whether armed or unarmed guards, escort personnel or escort vehicles are to be utilized 
 
the number of any armed or unarmed guards, escort personnel or escort vehicles to be utilized 
 
any provisions for the support of response forces along the transport route 
 
any procedures for contacting, during the act of conveyance, the response force from any 
involved jurisdiction or agency 
 
provisions for rigorous security searches of the proposed conveyance vehicles prior to 
shipment of nuclear material, for the purpose of detecting any sabotage attempt or other threat 
 
contingency arrangements to address such events as a mechanical breakdown of a transport or 
escort vehicle, or a failure of the shipment to arrive at its destination at the expected time 
 
the procedures to be followed during any scheduled stop, or unscheduled delay, during 
transport 
 
the measures to be in place at Canadian ports, air cargo terminals or other locations where the 
nuclear material is to be stored and secured during transport 
The level of security for nuclear materials during interim storage while in transport, including 
during each overnight stop, should typically be comparable to that provided for the same category 
of nuclear material during its storage at a licensed nuclear facility. These security arrangements 
should take into account the location of the proposed interim storage and the nuclear material’s 
potential appeal to thieves or terrorists. 
When proposing to transport nuclear materials on journeys that could take more than one day, the 
applicant should include provision for overnight stays at a prearranged location where the 
transport vehicle carrying the nuclear material can be immobilized and kept in a physically secure 
and appropriately monitored area. The provisions for preventing theft of the nuclear materials 
should include securing the materials to the vehicle. 
In addition to dealing with scheduled stops at prearranged locations, the transportation security 
plan should describe the security measures to be taken in the event of unexpected delays caused 
by natural or other hazards. 
The applicant should attempt to anticipate and address, at an early stage, any special public 
concerns regarding the proposed transport that could lead to negative media coverage and to 
protests or demonstrations. Accordingly, the applicant should provide for effective contacts with 
September 2020 
REGDOC-2.12.3, Security of Nuclear Substances: 
 
Sealed Sources and Category I, II and III Nuclear Material, Version 2.1 
 
49 
 
local and provincial response forces in order to gain early notice of any road closures or detours 
implemented to deal with such incidents. 
8.1.6 
Communication arrangements 
Paragraph 5(e) of the NSR requires that the communication arrangements that will be in place 
throughout the transport of the nuclear material be part of the transportation security plan. These 
may include communication arrangements with: 
 
the licensee 
 
the operator of the vehicle transporting the nuclear material 
 
the recipient of the material 
 
any response force along the transport route 
 
any transport security control centre (or security monitoring room (SMR), where applicable) 
that is to be established for the operation 
If the licence applicant proposes to use cellular phones for communications during the transport 
of Category II or III nuclear material, the proposal should provide for limited use of such phones 
and encryption of messages where possible. It is important that all those involved in the transport 
and security of nuclear material be aware that unencrypted communications by cellular phone are 
not secure. Accordingly, the use of cellular phones to send unencrypted messages regarding the 
transport of Category I nuclear material is not recommended. For such situations, radio systems 
that utilize encryption features provide a more secure means of communication. 
Whether a radio or a cellular phone is to be used, it is important to assure that communications 
coverage is adequate along the entire route. In remote regions, there may be gaps in cellular or 
radio coverage. Where it may not be possible to avoid such “blackout” areas along the transport 
route, other communications arrangements should be proposed. Satellite and global positioning 
systems (GPS) provide for continuous tracking and monitoring in areas where cellular coverage is 
limited or unavailable. 
For each primary communication method proposed, the transportation security plan should 
include appropriate emergency backup provisions. For example, where the use of cellular phones 
is proposed, the applicant should provide for the supply of more than one phone and 
supplementary power sources for the phones. 
Applicants who plan to make regular shipments of nuclear material may wish to propose the 
establishment of a transport security control centre. Typically, such a centre would be operated 
during the shipment of nuclear material. Where the applicant proposes to establish a transport 
security control centre, the proposal should include provision for the training of the persons who 
will staff the centre. These staff should be trained in the techniques to be used to monitor the 
proposed shipments of nuclear materials, and in the proposed communications arrangements 
among the parties listed above. 
The transportation security plan should also indicate the action to be taken if communications 
contact with a vehicle carrying nuclear material is lost. For such situations, applicants may wish 
to consider the use of electronic and satellite tracking devices, such as transponders that can be 
concealed on a vehicle or in the shipment. Such devices could be used to track the vehicle 
carrying nuclear material, and could be particularly useful in situations where communications 
are interrupted. 
September 2020 
REGDOC-2.12.3, Security of Nuclear Substances: 
 
Sealed Sources and Category I, II and III Nuclear Material, Version 2.1 
 
50 
 
The proposed communications arrangements with response forces along the transport route 
should include notifying the relevant response force of any scheduled or unscheduled overnight 
stops, including the exact location of the overnight stops. 
8.1.7 
Arrangements with response forces 
In accordance with paragraph 5(f) of the NSR, the transportation security plan must include the 
arrangements to be made between the licensee and any response force along the transport route. 
Guidance 
The applicant’s proposed arrangements should include provisions for establishing effective 
communications with any response force along the transport route, in accordance with section 
8.1.6 above. The provisions should include notifying the response force from any involved 
jurisdiction or agency of the shipment, in advance of the actual transport. 
As part of the applicant’s proposed arrangements, a response force, such as a local law 
enforcement agency or a private security firm, may provide an armed escort for a shipment of 
nuclear material. Where the arrangements involve more than one law enforcement agency, the 
plan should describe the cooperative arrangements for transferring responsibility from one 
response force to another. For example, a transport route that crosses the border between Quebec 
and an adjoining province would pass through the jurisdiction of the Sûreté du Québec, as well as 
the jurisdiction of the Ontario Provincial Police or the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and, 
where these respective forces serve as escorts, would require corresponding transfers of 
responsibility. Accordingly, all changes in the proposed communications methods or protocols 
for the planned transfers of responsibility along a transport route – such as changes in radio 
frequencies or radio or cellular encryption methods – should be clearly described in the plan. 
8.1.8 
Planned and alternate routes 
Under paragraphs 5(g) and (h) of the NSR, the transportation security plan shall include 
descriptions of “the planned route” and “the alternate route to be used in the event of an 
emergency”. 
Guidance 
When selecting the planned or alternate routes for the transport of nuclear material, the applicant 
should take into account applicable regulations and ordinances regarding transport routes for 
hazardous materials, and choose routes that bypass urban areas wherever practical. However, if 
the proposed route is to pass through an urban area, the applicant should describe the precise 
route to be taken through the area and how the shipment is to be scheduled to avoid times of peak 
traffic. 
When proposing an alternate route, the applicant should take into consideration the feasibility and 
logistics of switching from one route to another during the transport of nuclear materials. For 
example, to facilitate potential switches from a planned route to an alternate route, and vice versa, 
the applicant should ensure that adequate transportation connections exist between the proposed 
routes, and should provide accurate descriptions of the proposed routes for transferring between 
the planned and alternate routes. 
September 2020 
REGDOC-2.12.3, Security of Nuclear Substances: 
 
Sealed Sources and Category I, II and III Nuclear Material, Version 2.1 
 
51 
 
When choosing routes for the transport of nuclear material, the applicant should take into account 
any obvious hazards, such as rockslides, floods or forest fires, that could adversely affect the 
transport at certain times. 
8.2 Confidentiality 
Since a transportation security plan for a licence to transport Category I, II or III nuclear material 
contains “prescribed information” for the purposes of the NSCA, it must be handled in such a 
way as to protect such information in accordance with the applicable provisions of the GNSCR. 
Licence applicants and licensees must take all necessary precautions to prevent unauthorized 
access to any prescribed information contained in a transportation security plan. Accordingly, the 
CNSC recommends that the licensees follow appendix D when preparing, submitting or revising 
a transportation security plan. 
8.3 Regulatory review and licensing 
After receiving an application for a licence to transport Category I, II or III nuclear material with 
the transportation security plan, the CNSC will evaluate the adequacy of the information 
submitted and will accordingly:  
 
if the application meets regulatory requirements and is approved by the Commission, issue 
the requested licence at its earliest convenience, or as requested by the applicant 
 
if the application is incomplete or if the information provided is inadequate, advise the 
applicant of the deficiency  
Where circumstances warrant, an applicant for any CNSC licence may choose to deliberately 
submit an incomplete application, requesting CNSC to perform a preliminary review. In such 
cases, the applicant should provide justification for the request and a schedule for completing the 
application. 
To allow maximum time for regulatory review and processing of applications for such a licence, 
the CNSC encourages the applicants to submit their proposed transportation security plans as 
soon as possible and in advance of the rest of the application where necessary in the interests of 
timeliness. 
The transportation security plan is fundamental to the safety and security of the proposed 
transport and, accordingly, will be subjected to rigorous regulatory review. Where this review 
identifies deficiencies, the deficiencies will need to be resolved before the licence to transport 
Category I, II or III nuclear material may be issued.  
Appendix D to this guide provides advice on preparing, submitting and revising transport security 
plans.

Sealed Sources and Category I, II and III Nuclear Materials, Version 2.1 
59 
 
Appendix D: Preparing, Submitting and Revising the Security Program Description 
or Transport Security Plan 
This appendix provides recommendations to help applicants and licensees prepare and submit, or revise 
the security program description that consolidates the security information that is to be included in an 
application for a licence – other than a licence to transport – in respect of: 
 
 
Category I or II nuclear material 
 
a nuclear facility consisting of a nuclear reactor that may exceed 10 MW thermal power during 
normal operation 
This appendix also provides recommendations to help applicants and licensees prepare and submit, or 
revise, a transportation security plan for Category I, II, or III nuclear material. 
For the purposes of this appendix, the term “document” refers to either the security program description 
or a transportation security plan. 
D.1 General 
The information contained in the security program description or transportation security plan should be 
clear and concise. Definitions and abbreviations used should be consistent throughout the document. The 
specialized terms used should conform to those defined or used for comparable purposes in relevant 
regulations. Any drawing or sketch included in the document should be large enough so as to be clearly 
legible. 
To minimize duplication, information that is provided in one section of the document may be cross-
referenced for the purposes of other sections of the document. 
D.2 Confidentiality and security 
Pursuant to sections 21 and 23 of the GNSCR, the security program description or security transportation 
plan is “prescribed information” and must be protected to prevent any unauthorized access. This requires 
that the document, and all correspondence between the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC) 
and licence applicants or licensees that concerns the document, be treated as confidential or protected 
information, as follows: 
 
The top right-hand corner of each page of the document should bear the security classification level 
of the document, that is, “CONFIDENTIAL — PRESCRIBED INFORMATION”, in bold, 
uppercase letters. 
 
The document and the related correspondence may be forwarded to the CNSC by mail or courier. 
For delivery to the CNSC, the document and the related correspondence should be “double-enveloped”, 
with the document and correspondence contained within the inner envelope or package. The inner 
envelope or package should be addressed to the “Director, CNSC Nuclear Security Division”, sealed and 
clearly marked “CONFIDENTIAL–PRESCRIBED INFORMATION”, labelled “TO BE OPENED BY 
THE ADDRESSEE ONLY”, and inserted into an outer envelope or package. The outer envelope or 
package should be sealed and addressed to: 
Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission 
280 Slater Street 
September 2020 
REGDOC-2.12.3, Security of Nuclear Substances:  
Sealed Sources and Category I, II and III Nuclear Materials, Version 2.1 
60 
 
P. O. Box 1046, Station B 
Ottawa, Ontario  K1P 5S9 
If the transportation security plan and the related correspondence are sent to the CNSC by “secure 
facsimile”, the transmission should meet the Level I (“Confidential”) requirements of the 
Communications Security Establishment. 
Upon receiving the document or the related correspondence, the CNSC will protect it from unauthorized 
disclosure, in accordance with the GNSCR and the Access to Information Act. 
D.3 Style, structure and layout 
The document should include a title page, a table of contents and a glossary of any specialized terms used 
in the document. It should display a unique identifier. The pages should be numbered sequentially. 
Information items should be numbered and identified, as appropriate, according to the sequence and 
headings given in section 6 of this regulatory document for a security program description or according to 
the sequence and headings given in subsection 8.1 of this regulatory document for a transportation 
security plan. 
D.4 Revising the program or plan 
CNSC licensees must comply with the applicable regulations and licence conditions, including any 
condition of their licence that requires them to adhere to a referenced security program description or 
transportation security plan. To modify the referenced document, the licensee must submit a revised 
version to obtain CNSC approval of the proposed changes. 
When requesting CNSC approval to revise an existing security program description or transportation 
security plan, the licensee should identify, and explain the reasons for, the proposed changes. The request 
for approval should include a single, complete copy of the new version of the document. To assist CNSC 
review, the proposed revisions or revised sections should be underlined or highlighted. The proposed 
document should follow the above recommendations and be clearly identified, using the convention 
described in section D.3 above.
